Three Senate committees, including the Intelligence Committee, have launched inquiries; some Democrats worry that the Trump Administration will try to stifle these investigations. **Although senators on the Intelligence Committee cannot reveal classified information, they have ways of signalling concern.** Three weeks after the election, Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and six other members of the committee sent a public letter to Obama, declaring, “**We believe there is additional information concerning the Russian Government and the U.S. election that should be declassified and released to the public**.” At a hearing in January, Wyden pushed further. While questioning James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., Wyden cited media reports that some Trump associates had links to Russians who are close to Putin. **Wyden asked if Comey would declassify information on that subject and “release it to the American people.”** Comey said, “I can’t talk about it.” Wyden’s questioning had served its purpose.\n",
