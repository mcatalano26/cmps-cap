,"I'm going to assume that by ""assault weapon"" you mean a semi-automatic rifle that accepts magazines. If the case you site were to be used as precedent, it would probably come down to what constitutes ""common"".  [The National Shooting Sports Foundation estimates there are roughly 5  million to 10 million AR-15 rifles owned in the United States](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/13/owned-by-5-million-americans-ar-15-under-renewed-fire-after-orlando-massacre.html). That number alone strikes me as fulfilling the criteria of common, and the AR-15 is not the only weapon of that type out there. But I can definitely see arguments being made that the number would have to higher, since ""common"" is so open to interpretation.",,,cr5yg0,ex3d7io,1.1204704718849796,0.8392132561389853
,"u/Chasicle and others have asked ""What is an assault weapon?""

You have to start here.  Assault weapon is a legal term of art.  Take the recently proposed [H.R.1296 - Assault Weapons Ban of 2019's](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1296/text) suggested [amendments to the definitions](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr1296/BILLS-116hr1296ih.pdf) of [18 U.S.C. §921](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921):

>(36) The term ‘semiautomatic assault weapon’ means any of the following, regardless of country of manufacture or caliber of ammunition accepted:

>...

>(D) A semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and any one of the following: (i) A threaded barrel. (ii) A second pistol grip. (iii) A barrel shroud. (iv) The capacity to accept a detachable magazine at some location outside of the pistol grip. (v) A semiautomatic version of an auto-
matic firearm. (vi) A manufactured weight of 50 ounces
or more when unloaded. (vii) A stabilizing brace or similar compo-
nent.

>(E) A semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds.

>(F) A semiautomatic shotgun that has any one of the following: (i) A folding, telescoping, or detachable stock. (ii) A pistol grip. (iii) A fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 5 rounds. (iv) The ability to accept a detachable magazine. (v) A forward grip. (vi) A grenade launcher. (G) Any shotgun with a revolving cylinder.

>...

So, a semi-automatic pistol with a threaded barrel for a sound suppressor to help prevent hearing loss would be considered an ""assault weapon"" under this definition as well as certain shotguns.  The term is often confused with select-fire rifles (i.e. those capable of choosing between semi-automatic, burst, and/or automatic fire) with an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine (i.e. [assault rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle).) which are already more or less banned.  So, assault weapon is a legal term of art and not otherwise a class of firearm.  In other words, anything can be an ""assault weapon"" depending on how the law is written.

Turning to buy backs, let's take a look at an example from state law. California has a different definition of assault weapon, using several methods to define them from a list by [make and model](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=30510.) to [a definition based on features](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=30515.). [California Penal Code, § 30605](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=30605.) allows for a firearm defined as an assault weapon that is relinquished to be destroyed.  [Cal. Penal Code, § 18005](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=18005.) allows for weapons to be sold at public auction or destroyed.  The argument supporting this is likely some combination of a state's traditional police powers and that you do not have a property interest in goods which are illegal to possess.

>Would such a law/policy be legal?

Could such a law be passed?  Sure.  Would it be Constitutional?  In a way, Blackstone answers that question when discussing how the the right to bear arms functions in a free state in [his first chapter, ""Of the Absolute Rights of Individuals,"" in his Commentaries on the Laws of England:](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp)

>But in vain would these rights be declared, ascertained, and protected by the dead letter of the laws, if the constitution had provided no other method to secure their actual enjoyment. It has therefore established certain other auxiliary subordinate rights of the subject, which serve principally as barriers to protect and maintain inviolate the three great and primary rights, of personal security, personal liberty, and private property.

****

>...we have seen that these rights consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights, having no other object upon which it can possibly be employed. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it's full vigor; and limits certainly known, be set to the royal prerogative. And, lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly to the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence. And all these rights and liberties it is our birthright to enjoy entire; unless where the laws of our country have laid them under necessary restraints. Restraints in themselves so gentle and moderate, will appear upon farther enquiry, that no man of sense or probity would wish to see them slackened.

Civil rights, such as the second amendment, are intended as a constraint on government power.  When the government engages in the business of loosening constraints upon itself, people have recourse in the courts and, failing that, reaching out to their elected representatives and officials.  

[Some courts](http://michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-07-22-Order-Granting-Defendants-MSJ-Denying-Plaintiffs-MSJ.pdf) do take the second amendment to read much more narrowly and see banning certain weapons as ""gentle and moderate"" in light of that court's view that ""Semiautomatic rifles with non-fixed magazines, along with the other enumerated features, are incredibly effective killing machines...""  This line of reasoning attempts to blur the lines between assault weapons and assault rifles in order to fit the former within a comment from [D.C. v. Heller](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6484080926445491577&q=District+of+Columbia+v.+Heller&hl=en&as_sdt=2006), ""It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service—M-16 rifles and the like—may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause.""  So, does ""M-16 rifles and the like"" mean the M-16 and other assault rifles, firearms capable of burst and/or automatic fire? Or, do certain semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns also resemble M-16s?  

Given the current composition of the Supreme Court, I doubt very much a federal buyback program using the definition of ""assault weapon"" in H.R. 1296 would survive challenge.",prime_23571113,,cr5yg0,ex3ki3m,1.2189010377346787,0.8639665258273982

The government shouldn't be buying anything from the public, because it would be wasting our tax money to buy weapons they won't use.

The government has no authority to circumvent the 2nd amendment in this case. If they ban AR-15s, by the same definition of a semi-automatic weapon, they could also ban all guns.",no112358,,cr5yg0,ex5ps5h,0.8260000477353566,0.7781253966481827
,"The biggest problem you're going to have with anything regarding ""assault weapons"" is that there's no agreed upon definition of what an [""assault weapon""](https://reason.com/2018/05/14/assault-weapons-explained/) is. In many cases, the determination is arbitrary or aesthetic rather than an objective classification that can be clearly applied to all firearms. The article uses the Ruger Mini 14 as an example. It's a firearm that comes in many variants, some of which might be considered ""assault weapons"", but there's mechanically little to no difference in the actual operation or functionality of them.

All of that aside, compelled sale of legally owned property is a tough subject. The closest thing the US has to that is [Eminent Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain_in_the_United_States), but even that has requirements that don't strictly apply to this situation, like public need/use. The other big hurdle, which a lot of gun owners would site as a financial reason for not participating in buyback programs is [""just compensation""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_compensation) (which most people don't realize is a constitutional requirement when the government seizes private property).",tklite,,cr5yg0,ex3c04q,0.4377537121466107,0.8614704347957045
,"The short answer is maybe. I'm by no means an expert in weapons law, but I do like the constitution a lot, so I'll come at it from that angle. 

Even since Heller, people's right to bear arms was divorced from the organized militia part of the [Second Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-ii), but that right does not appear to be unlimited. Even though [Federal legislation banning assault weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States) has never passed (and therefore was never tested in the courts), state law regulations of those weapons seems to have survived challenge. It therefore appears that the government MIGHT have the right to regulate those weapons.

The other applicable constitutional concept is [Eminent domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain), which obliges a government that takes a thing to pay for it. Therefore, the govenment can buy your stuff without your consent. 

There might be an undue restraint of commerce or right to contract argument, but I don't think it will really have any impact.

Edit: u/Anonymonynonymous points out we did have a federal assault weapon ban for a while, but I haven’t heard of it being challenged in court.

Edit the second: u/northjed points out that the federal assault weapon ban was challenged in court, and survived, so precedent would dictate that assault weapons can be banned by the federal government.

,"As a preface to my argument, I would ask that we restrict opinions to the subject at hand - firearms legislation. 
With that what being said, I think there is is oddly a lot of useful precedent to be found in the battle over abortion and restriction of its practice.

[Roe v Wade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) famously mad abortion legal on the basis that the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental ""right to privacy"". This right is not absolute, and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and protecting prenatal life. Even with the most critical reading, I think it is fair to say that gun ownership has *at minimum* as much Constitutional support as abortion being legal. The lesson here, which can be seen in a multitude of other rulings on various topics, is that no Constitutional right is absolute and they must be balanced against the impact on others rights.

The [Hyde Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment) specifically restricted the use of federal funds to provide for abortion. To me, this implies that a law could be passed restricting the use of federal funds for gun buy-back. The absence of such an law does not however prove that a federally funded buy-back would be legal.

[Planned Parenthood v Casey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey) established the ""undue burden"" standard for abortion resteictions which applies to any restriction with ""the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion"". It is also worth noting that this ruling determined that a 24 hour waiting period for abortion did not qualify as an undue burden, which should be self evident in its relevance to firearm laws. When people talking about banning assault weapons are citing barrel shrouds, which have absolutely no effect on the lethality of any firearm, I think that is an identical example of a restriction that places an undue burden on a person exercising their Constitutional right.

[Stenburg v Carhart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenberg_v._Carhart) was a case where the supreme court overturned a Nebraska law banning ""partial birth abortion"" on the grounds that it was overly broad and was akin to a total ban. When there are definitions of ""assault weapons"" that include pistols, shotguns, and rifles with a wide array of common features, I would argue that too qualifies as overly broad.

The [Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act), unlike the Nebraska law, was found to be Constitutional as it was not overly broad. The lesson here is that a ""assault weapon"" definition would have to meet a certain reasonable threshold of restrictiveness.

[Whole Woman Health v Hellerstadt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Woman%27s_Health_v._Hellerstedt) ruled again that certain restrictions created an undue burden on abortion access, specifically admitting privileges for abortion doctors and surgical center requirements for those doctor's offices. Broadly, I could see similar arguments being made that restrictions on the licensing and operation of firearm vendors could similarly be an undue burden if they become too restrictive. 

I dont have any grand conclusions whether or not a buyback would be possible or legal. I am just trying to establish some vaguely consistent legal boundaries of what is and is not possible. Even the most fervently anti-gun person has to admit that firearm ownership has a more firm Constitutional grounding than abortion, so it is reasonable to at bare minimum be no more restrictive than laws regarding that.",heimdahl81,,cr5yg0,ex4vyo0,0.8587728440344954,0.8818634687958045

,"Again, my background includes a graduate degree on a Russia-related topic, but not military history, so take what I have with a grain of salt. 

In the late-1980s, Glasnost and Perestroika were formidable political movements, but largely window dressing. Chernobyl is a great example of the Soviet's attempt to control the narrative and willingness to lie to not only its citizenry but allies about the full effect of the radiation. At the time, the USSR was ""reducing"" its military expenditures (they just went off book) while trying to appear more open, which was a way to get the West's eyes off the USSR's business. It was signed at the twilight of the USSR - by the end of 1989 there were revolts in East Germany and many of the satellite Soviet states. The Soviet economy had tanked, they were running low on everything and were getting wheat from the West. The wheels were coming off the tractor, as it were, so the Russians were signing agreements with the West to appear more inclusive and open as a way to secure food, currency and political support. The Soviet Navy and the US Navy conducted joint exercises, and warships from the USSR docked in San Diego while US Navy vessels docked in Vladivostok. It was all a show. Included in that show was Open Skies. 

Was it important? As a sign of peace and reconciliation? Sure. But, did it have military value? No. US spy satellites routinely take very clear and accurate photographs, it's how the US knew what was going on in Ukraine and could orient sea-to-land missiles from ships. So, does Open Skies provide valuable intel? Not really. Open Skies requires specific equipment flying along specific routes, so obviously countries prepare for those missions. With the advent of spy satellites and better human intelligence, the US doesn't need Open Skies to provide intel. 

I posit that countries see the agreement as being from an era where reconciliation was possible and Russia may join the Western fold - [there had been talk](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jul-01-op-17546-story.html) of them joining NATO. With Open Skies gone, it doesn't change anything. It just removes the veneer of peace that we constructed for 20 years and pretended wasn't there. 

From the moment Russia emerged from the Soviet rubble, they had called for an elimination of [Jackson-Vanik](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/reassessing-jackson-vanik-amendment) and the establishment of permanent normal trade relations. The US wasn't keen to do that as Russia had long evaded international law and never fully embraced democracy. The Chechen Wars saw gross human rights violations, including a very powerful rape campaign ([read Andrew Meier's book on that](https://www.amazon.ca/Black-Earth-Journey-Through-Russia/dp/0393326411)), installed strongman Ramzan Kadyrov and then started numerous conflicts, including Georgia in 2008. Russia has never followed the rule of law, they have no real free press and much of the country is run by a cadre of politically-connected quasi-political leaders empowered by Putin. But, so long as agreements like Open Skies are in place, and Jackson-Vanik is gone, it gives the appearance of some semblance of Russia's willingness to engage in dialogue with the West. While I don't agree with Trump on much, calling BS to the Russian agreement (whether that's his intention or not) is actually a good move.

How Local Covid Deaths Are Affecting Vote Choice

A rise in coronavirus-related deaths in a given community tends to reduce support for Republicans.

By Lynn Vavreck and Christopher Warshaw

July 28, 2020Updated 9:12 a.m. ET

On March 18, Donald J. Trump declared himself a wartime president against “the invisible enemy” of coronavirus and invoked the Defense Production Act. Now he’s facing a downside of presiding over a war: American casualties.
In the days since that pronouncement, Covid-19 has taken the lives of almost 150,000 Americans, many more than have died in recent wars combined. Data from over 328,692 interviews in 3,025 counties across the nation suggest that coronavirus-related deaths, like casualties of war, are hurting the president’s approval rating and may cost him and his party votes.

The gap between stated voting support for Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. grows by about 2.5 percentage points in Mr. Biden’s favor when a county has extremely high levels of coronavirus-related deaths relative to when it has low levels. These changes may come within counties as the number of virus-related deaths change, or across counties at any given point in time. For example, Covid-19 fatalities exploded in Wayne County in Michigan in April, suggesting a 1.25-point expansion of the gap between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden.

Cases in Maricopa County, in Arizona, have nearly quadrupled in the last two months, suggesting an 0.6-point increase in the vote support gap between the candidates. Other places have seen little impact from Covid-19, such as Wyoming and some Plains states. Our data show that Mr. Trump has continued to do well in those states, perhaps even increasing his share of the vote in recent months.
Republicans running for the U.S. House and Senate lose just as much support as Mr. Trump does when deaths rise locally. It may feel as if all politics is national, but it is not.

Thanks for reading The Times.


Research shows that when people are killed in action during wartime, residents of the place the victims are from tend to hold elected leaders in Congress and the White House accountable. Political scientists have found this to be true for midterm and presidential elections during the Civil War, the Vietnam War, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Coronavirus-related deaths seem to be having a similar effect.


It’s also true that partisan leanings have influenced views on the nation’s current crises. July data from the Pew Research Center show a wide divide between Democrats and Republicans on coronavirus. Only 46 percent of Republicans say the outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. public, compared with 85 percent of Democrats who do.
Still, reactions to the pandemic are about more than being a Democrat or Republican. The front lines of the fight against Covid-19 are in local communities where sick people try to get tested and endure quarantine; where some succumb to the disease, often alone; and where doctors fight to provide care.

To understand whether these community-level experiences are affecting people’s views of the president and his party, we need local-level data on both Covid-19 deaths and people’s views of Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans over time — as the death tolls change place to place. This is a challenge; a typical poll of 1,000 people cannot deliver sufficiently granular data. There are more than 3,000 counties in the country, and the death tolls are changing in each of them in different ways every week.
The Democracy Fund + U.C.L.A. Nationscape Project has been interviewing 6,250 people a week since July 2019. To date, there are more than 300,000 completed interviews spanning every state in the country and most counties. The survey is conducted online and is fielded by the market research firm Lucid.

The data contain more cases in big places like Los Angeles County than in small ones, like Grafton County, N.H., but there are enough people in counties with varying rates of Covid-19 deaths over time to investigate whether a relationship exists.
For our analyses, people in the survey are assigned their county’s per-capita 60-day cumulative number of Covid-19 deaths. The 60-day period is that just preceding the date each person was interviewed. In this way, we capture variation in county-level deaths within counties because people in the same county are interviewed on different days.
Similarly, because people have been interviewed all over the country on the same dates, we also have captured variation across counties at the same moment. Some counties had high Covid-19 death rates in April, while others did not. As we moved into May and June, a different set of counties experienced rising rates. The goal is to figure out whether the differences in Covid-19 deaths per capita in a county at a given point in time are affecting how people plan to vote in 2020 and how they rate the president. (We also try to account for possible confounding factors that might also be changing broadly at the same time: See more on the methodology at bottom.)
The analyses reveal clear patterns across multiple levels of geography (states and counties) and different offices (president, Senate and House). Local coronavirus fatalities are hurting Republicans running for federal offices.

A doubling of cases per capita in a county over the last 60 days drops Mr. Trump’s two-party vote margin against Mr. Biden by a third of a percentage point — a seemingly small gap, but not when you consider that several recent elections have been won by narrow margins. In 2016, the critical state of Michigan was won by less than a third of a point; Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were won by less than a point. And some places are seeing a tripling or quadrupling of cases.

The news for Republicans running for the House and Senate is equally bad.
A number of swing Senate elections are in states that have experienced recent rises in Covid-19 cases, including Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina. In Arizona, for example, the gap between Senator Martha McSally, the Republican, and her Democratic challenger, Mark Kelly, continues to grow as the state has surpassed 3,300 virus-related deaths (up from 941 on June 2). Local virus fatalities are costing Republicans running for Senate as much as they are costing the president, in a year when Republicans are fighting to hold on to a majority in the chamber.
There are less than 100 days until Election Day, and many Americans will vote even earlier. Voters appear to be holding the president and his party accountable for the increasing number of deaths in communities around the country. Reducing the toll of the virus is in everyone’s best interest in terms of public health. For Republicans, it is also crucial to their electoral prospects.

More on the methodology: The data on virus-related deaths come from The New York Times coronavirus tracking project, which we merge to the Nationscape survey data by county. We tried to account for other factors that might be changing everywhere at the same time, like the Black Lives Matter protests, or things that might be specific to one particular county, like its pre-existing level of support for the president. We use a method that controls for these differences across time and across counties, helping us to isolate the effects of Covid-19 deaths on vote. (We also account for some things about the people in the surveys, like their age, race, gender, ethnicity, education and 2016 vote choice).
By doing this, we try to be sure that the relationships we’ve uncovered aren’t being driven by characteristics of the people we have interviewed or things like how many Democrats live in a county or the fact that case counts went up at the same time protests swept the nation in many places. The analysis doesn’t account for any national effects of Covid-19. The details of our analyses are laid out in a paper we’ve written with the U.C.L.A. Ph.D. student Ryan Baxter-King.

,"[Here is the actual law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-35), USC 50 §§ 1701–1707 for IEEPA.

The very first section makes me think that, yes, the President has the power to do something like this, but, no, he doesn't in this situation as far as I am aware. He must first declare a state of national emergency and there must be an ""unusual and extraordinary threat,"" and I'm not sure if a trade war really qualifies.

> 50 U.S. Code § 1701. Unusual and extraordinary threat; declaration of national emergency; exercise of Presidential authorities
> 
> (a) Any authority granted to the President by section 1702 of this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.
> 
> (b) The authorities granted to the President by section 1702 of this title may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared for purposes of this chapter and may not be exercised for any other purpose. Any exercise of such authorities to deal with any new threat shall be based on a new declaration of national emergency which must be with respect to such threat.

I do not know if ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" is a defined term elsewhere.

National emergencies are covered under the previous chapter, [USC 50 §§ 1601-1651](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-34). Under § 1622, it looks like the President can declare and terminate national emergencies, and Congress can terminate them as well. Note that the President is also *explicitly* required to specify exactly which emergency powers he is going to exercise (50 USC § 1631).",da_chicken,,cvbghy,ey3a01t,0.9497522268961602,0.8346507677910812
,">What precedent, if any, supports Trump's position that POTUS can use a national emergency declaration to regulate and compel international trade? Or are there any precedents against the view?

The president can [declare a national emergency to](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1702) create tariffs, block or prohibit transactions, confiscate property, or freeze assets. So, there are certainly ways the president can punish companies who don't do what he says. On the other hand, there is no way for the US government to directly compel a company to do something in another country. It's not in the law and there's just no mechanism for it. It's not like you can send the Chinese police after these companies, and you obviously can't send American police into China. 

>What is the legal process by which an administration executes that law's provisions?

I think this hits the nail on the head. There is no legal process to directly do what the president is saying, but he could (for example) declare a national emergency and freeze the assets of all US companies who are still in China in January 2021. 

>In light of the fact that China contributes billions to the earnings of US corporations like Apple, how could US firms challenge Trump's supposed legal authority if he does execute the order?

Challenges to other national emergencies have gone through the US court system, they would just sue like anyone else.

>What can Congress and the courts do to stop Trump from attempting the sweeping order on trade?

The Supreme Court especially has been deferential to the president's ability to regulate international relations so I don't know that they *would* but they *could* say that it isn't a real national emergency, set some parameters for what constitutes a 'real' national emergency, and nullify the order. 

Congress is the one that passed the law allowing the president to do anything with international tariffs or trade, it's not in [Article 2 of the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution). If they passed a law with veto-proof majorities saying that the president can't do any tariffs or freeze assets without their express permission, it would be constitutional.",nemoomen,,cvbghy,ey3e0fg,1.4816376247387255,0.828167881444517
,"I'm going to focus primarily on the first question posed in this post. Before I get started, I think this statement by u/highresthought in the thread is especially pertinent to this discussion:

>Whether you disagree with trump using those powers or not, is totally irrelevant to whether he has the authority to use those powers. 

That being said, the President has invoked a National Emergency in situations involving trade [eight times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States). One of these is still in effect - specifically, EO 13222. This is essentially a national emergency which invokes presidential authority to control trade in matters related to national security as a continuance of the [Arms Control Act of 1979](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-39) to be regulated by the Executive Branch. As I understand it, it's one of the main barriers of entry that China faces to the US arms market. Five of the other trade related EO are also continuations of the Arms Control Act of 1979 

Interestingly, this was amended by EO 13637 which delegated the act to the Secretary of State. However, according to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/text-notice-president-speaker-house-representatives-president-senate/):

>Because the Congress has not renewed the Export Administration Act, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2018.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622 (d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222, as amended by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013. 

Basically, the President/Secretary of State (and further delegates, if you read the amendments) are able to unilaterally regulate and penalize actors who violate the Arms Export Act of 1979. However, do note that all these amendments are allowed because the power of delegation and for reasons of national security, and that [IEEPA](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:50%20section:1701%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title50-section1701)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true), 

>[may only be used](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20190624_IN11129_b258b06d0f01a542648c1a68697f0ea93eb5e5a3.html) ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States....""

Thus, this deals with the *Export* factor of National Emergencies. Under current law, the Executive Branch, primarily delegating authority (through  to the Secretary of State/Secretary of Defense, and thus doesn't really apply to regulating domestic trade but enforcing the 1979 AEA, specifically in U.S.C. 22, Ch. 38/39.

On the import side, we have EO 13194, the [""Blood Diamonds""](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/01/23/01-2140/prohibiting-the-importation-of-rough-diamonds-from-sierra-leone) resolution, which specifically barred the import of illegally obtained diamonds from Sierra Leone. I encourage you to read it, because it uses language that (1) qualifies the reason of the order from an International agreed reason ([UN Resolution 1306](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1306))  (2) offers a legal alternative for the issue (importing only from verified legal vendors), and (3) is issued based on an existing US legal framework, [U.S.C. 287c](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/287c). 

Now, let's get back to the question: ""Can the President Order Firms to Leave China?""

Not *really,* but... *technically,* I see there being wiggle room here. First, the legal framework under which Trump imposes tariffs is largely based on the [1917 Trading With the Enemy Act](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/8/17097206/trump-tariffs-congress), among other reasons. But, Trump hasn't declared a national emergency related to Chinese trade. He *almost* issued an IEEPA, but[raised tariffs on Mexico anyway](https://www.lawfareblog.com/legal-authority-behind-trumps-new-tariffs-mexico) due to the aforementioned law. 

Second, [U.S.C. Ch. 77 § 6983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/6983) (Prohibiting relating to human rights abuses), used in conjunction with a UN Human Rights Council Resolution, could theoretically work as a framework to forming a similar ban on certain imports. EO 13194 contains an interesting section:

>The prohibition in section 1 of this order shall not apply to the importation of rough diamonds controlled through the Certificate of Origin regime of the Government of Sierra Leone. 

Basically, according to my reasoning, you could theoretically issue an EO related to a violation of U.S.C. Ch. 77 § 6983 if there is ever a UNHRC resolution, and then use a similar clause that verifies that China is taking steps through an external process to promote equitable trade. I'm going to be the first to admit that this is a *massive* leap of legal judgment and creativity - this is purely theoretical.

As mentioned earlier, the executive authority to unilaterally control trade is purely oriented around National Security. But, to label trade with China as a threat to national security under U.S.C. 22 Ch. 38/39 and regulate it through import/export control is paradoxical because that the trade relationship itself is a threat to national security could result in bizarre things such as penalizing Apple for Violating U.S.C. 22, Ch. 38/39 as pertinent to the 1979 AEA, which is just totally ridiculous.

,"I'm not gonna link to 49 different lawsuits, because they all have generally had similar rulings.

But here are three recent ones, two in PA and one from the Nevada Supreme Court, and one overarching article which goes into more detail on more cases.

A Republican Federal Judge dismissed the case stating the case was marred by “strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations…unsupported by evidence.”

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/12/09/nevada-supreme-court-rejects-trump-campaign-election-lawsuit-and-voter-fraud-claims/?sh=353bc21d6f48](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/12/09/nevada-supreme-court-rejects-trump-campaign-election-lawsuit-and-voter-fraud-claims/?sh=353bc21d6f48)

The Nevada Supreme Court unanimously rejected a case stating   “that there is no credible or reliable evidence that the 2020 General Election in Nevada was affected by fraud.”

[https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/trump-appointed-judges-rule-against-the-president-express-skepticism-in-election-cases](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/trump-appointed-judges-rule-against-the-president-express-skepticism-in-election-cases)

In this one a Trump appointed judge penned the opinion which stated  “Charges of unfairness are serious, but calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.”

And here is one overarching article from the Christian Science Monitor that outlines more cases and their rulings.

[https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/1210/Trump-has-asked-judges-to-overturn-election.-So-far-all-have-declined](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/1210/Trump-has-asked-judges-to-overturn-election.-So-far-all-have-declined)

So judges across the spectrum, and even those appointed by Trump himself, have not seen anything to merit even hearing many of these cases, and dismiss them outright. 

So far, none of Trump's attorneys have actually stated in court that they have evidence of specific fraud. Here are a couple more articles about the cases detailing what claims Trump's attorneys have actually made in court. 

[https://time.com/5914377/donald-trump-no-evidence-fraud/](https://time.com/5914377/donald-trump-no-evidence-fraud/)

And as most recently as today, Trump's attorneys stated their filing to intervene in the case that Texas filed with the Supreme Court that  *""Despite the chaos of election night and the days which followed, the media has consistently proclaimed that no widespread voter fraud has been proven. But this observation misses the point. The constitutional issue is not whether voters committed fraud but whether state officials violated the law by systematically loosening the measures for ballot integrity so that fraud becomes undetectable.""*

In short, there is no evidence of fraud, and even Trump's attorneys are not making that claim in court where they are bound by legal and ethics rules for what they can claim.

,"I'd make the case that the best evidence we have for fraud would be contained in the legal challenges to the results. 

Even though affidavits are admissible in court, it's important to make a distinction between individual allegations and legally presented evidence of fraud that's widespread and/or systematic enough to have effected the outcome of the election. The latter is really the relevant issue. 

The Trump campaign [has raised over $200 million](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55192699) since the election to pursue cases in various courts across the country with the apparent goal of overturning the results. Here's a [list of post-election lawsuits and their status.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election) Overall, they haven't gone well for the Trump campaign. That page also links to a list of pre-election suits, however, all but two of those have already been resolved and neither one alleges fraud; they're about the timing of valid ballots.

As others have said, it's hard to go through the evidence in every case, but PolitiFact has [a decent breakdown](https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/dec/10/donald-trump-has-lost-dozens-election-lawsuits-her/) of them, and [here's a piece](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/11/13/trump-voter-fraud-claims-investigated-2020-election/6259980002/) by the editor-in-chief of USA Today summarizing their investigations of all the claims.

Most of the failed claims so far have been repackaged in [the Texas suit](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/12/texas-tries-hail-mary-to-block-election-outcome/) (joined by other states) that petitions the US Supreme Court to intervene and invalidate results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In Georgia, the Republican Secretary of State who ran the election, the Republican Governor who certified the election, the Attorney General who represents the state, and the Lieutenant Governor, all claim they voted for Trump, and simultaneously assert that their state's election was free, fair and secure, resulting in a conclusive win for Joe Biden.

US Attorney General Bill Barr, considered by many to be [one of Trump's staunchest allies,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/15/william-barr-attorney-general-donald-trump-enabler) said in [a recent interview](https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/12/barr-no-evidence-of-widespread-voter-fraud-in-2020-presidential-election/) that the Department of Justice has ""not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.""

There's also the fact that [Republicans as a whole had a very good showing in this election,](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/11/933435840/the-2020-election-was-a-good-one-for-republicans-not-named-trump) picking up seats in the House, likely holding onto the Senate, and enjoying widespread success at the State level. So, if there were widespread fraud aimed at enhancing the Democratic vote or suppressing the Republican vote, it's hard to see how that fits with so much electoral success for Republicans across the board, excepting the President.

To conclude, I think it's reasonable to assume that the best evidence of widespread voter fraud is contained in the lawsuits the Trump campaign and its supporters have filed, and so far, those have been largely unsuccessful. Even in the few cases where they've gained a concession, the resulting remedy hasn't come close to shifting the outcome of the election.

,"As a political science student, all the research papers I've ever read on elections and fraud point to election fraud being exceedingly rare in this election and every election in the past century or so. [This article from the Brennan center cites a few of these studies, done by journalists and academics alike. It sums up the issue nicely.](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Briefing_Memo_Debunking_Voter_Fraud_Myth.pdf)  There is not enough actual fraud to have any significant effect on this election nor any other as long as researchers have had access to resources to analyze voting. That is not to say there is not fraud, in fact we've seen cases reported this year. The thing to remember is there is an insignificant number of them to flip any race. Also a most common source of ""fraud"" in any election is legitimate mistakes from voters like filling out forms incorrectly or with outdated information for example. Many of these mistakes can be explained away by confusion and lack of understanding of laws and procedures rather than malice. 

Think about it this way, 155 million votes were cast in this past election. The upper level of fraud found in studies cited by the Brennan Center was 0.02% or 31,000 spread across the country but that is a working paper that hasn't been reviewed. Other papers have it at 0.0003% or lower which is less than 500. Efforts by law enforcement to pursue voter fraud end in dozens of convictions out of millions of votes. It's not efficient or feasible to win an election by voter fraud and the risks are crazy high. You'll get more votes by supporting and  campaigning for your preferred candidate than you will by setting up an elaborate scheme to commit voter fraud. It's much easier to pay for some facebook ads or to tweet a bunch of nonsense to support or attack a candidate than commit actual voter fraud

,"Many of these points are listed on [https://democracyinstitute.org/reasons-why-the-2020-presidential-election-is-deeply-puzzling/](https://democracyinstitute.org/reasons-why-the-2020-presidential-election-is-deeply-puzzling/), you can read the whole article there and it presents all the reasons to have to be at least a little bit suspicious of the election, the sources below I've provided.

1. Late on election night, with Trump comfortably ahead, many swing states stopped counting ballots. In most cases, observers were removed from the counting facilities. Counting generally continued without the observers. \[Observers were falsely told by officials that counting was stopping. Georgia [Source](https://www.ntd.com/georgia-poll-observers-say-they-were-effectively-told-to-go-home_536471.html) Observers forced to stand 30 feet away from ballot counting, despite state laws Pennsylvania [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/philadelphia-vote-counting-ballots/2020/11/04/ea9169f4-1ee2-11eb-ba21-f2f001f0554b_story.html) \]
2. General Abnormalities. Not since President Grover Cleveland’s re-election campaign in 1888 has a sitting president won more votes the second time around and still lost, which is one reason he successfully ran again four years later. To put this in perspective, Obama [lost](https://reason.com/2012/11/19/barack-obama-first-president-re-elected/) 5 million votes between his 2008 and 2012 elections. He is the only president to have lost voters and still won re-election. By comparison, Trump not only added about 10 million votes to his 2016 haul but also shattered the record for most votes received by a sitting president. Trump won a greater share of [minority votes](https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2020/11/05/trump-the-racist-won-more-minority-votes-than-any-gop-candidate-since-1960-n1126235) than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 and brought more Democrats [over to his side](https://www.newsweek.com/10-percent-democrats-will-vote-trump-poll-says-1516431) than in 2016. More than nine in 10 [evangelical Christians](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/13/poll-90-percent-of-evangelicals-support-donald-trumps-re-election/) voted to re-elect the president. For Trump to [expand his coalition](https://nypost.com/2020/11/07/why-trump-grew-his-numbers-with-black-and-latino-voters/) of voters so substantially and still lose is historic.
3. The failure to match signatures on mail-in ballots.  \[Source: [https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-election-2020-pittsburgh-elections-presidential-elections-fc464c287c18823ff57fedc13facf7e5](https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-election-2020-pittsburgh-elections-presidential-elections-fc464c287c18823ff57fedc13facf7e5)\]
4. Historically low absentee ballot rejection rates despite the massive expansion of mail voting. Such is Biden’s narrow margin that, as political analyst Robert Barnes observes, ‘If the states simply imposed the same absentee ballot rejection rate as recent cycles, then Trump wins the election’. \[Low rejection rates of swing states specifically Georgia and Pennsylvania in 2020 compared to prior years is listed here with corresponding sources: [https://ballotpedia.org/Election\_results,\_2020:\_Analysis\_of\_rejected\_ballots](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2020:_Analysis_of_rejected_ballots)\]
5. Missing votes. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 50,000 votes held on 47 USB cards are missing. \[Expert witness testimony [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3WK0M4S\_Qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3WK0M4S_Qw), article describing content: [https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt\_app/poll-watcher-describes-pennsylvania-election-irregularities-including-47-missing-usb-cards\_3594549.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_app/poll-watcher-describes-pennsylvania-election-irregularities-including-47-missing-usb-cards_3594549.html)\]
6. Non-resident voters. Matt Braynard’s Voter Integrity Project estimates that 20,312 people who no longer met residency requirements cast ballots in Georgia. Biden’s margin is 12,670 votes. \[Braynard, Voter Integrity Project: Findings and Conclusions, at 25:35, YouTube (Nov. 24, 2020) (This video encapsulates the findings of the Voter Integrity Project's analysis and presents Matt Braynard's conclusions and recommendations.), available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9ihoLi1NA&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9ihoLi1NA&feature=youtu.be) and article describing content [https://tennesseestar.com/2020/11/29/voter-integrity-project-leader-matt-braynard-to-submit-absentee-vote-findings-to-georgia-case/](https://tennesseestar.com/2020/11/29/voter-integrity-project-leader-matt-braynard-to-submit-absentee-vote-findings-to-georgia-case/).\]

,"As a point of confusion, the linked PDF there has 43 pages, [while the one from the Texas Attorney General has 154.](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/SCOTUSFiling.pdf)  I live in Wisconsin, and it's interesting that the only actual instance of the word ""Wisconsin"" in the [supremecourt.gov](https://supremecourt.gov) link is in the title and a later footnote, when the one from Texas has an entire section.  Looking more closely, it seems your linked document only contains the Pennsylvania section.  Is the supreme court breaking these into multiple cases? I don't know how this normally works, but worth pointing out.

As for the one from the Texas AG in regards to Wisconsin, there's essentially four separate claims, two of which are things that definitely, provably happened and their legality is being challenged, and two that there are accusations of that I can't find proof for.

I'll start with the two (imo) biggest claims. 

1) Wisconsin law has strict rules about ballot dropboxes that were allegedly not followed in Dane and Milwaukee counties

2) Wisconsin law has signature and voter ID exceptions for persons that are ""indefinitely confined"".  Officials in Dane and Milwaukee counties encouraged voters to declare themselves ""indefinitely confined"" due to covid.

To start, there were ballot dropboxes some manned and some unmanned.  Per the Wisconsin law referenced in the suit, unmanned dropboxes are illegal, and allegedly the people running the manned dropboxes and the way in which they ran them and delivered the ballots were also illegal.  I'll defer to the suit for more details, since the legalese is wordy and I don't have a source for how the manned dropboxes were actually ran.

The ""indefinitely confined"" voter laws were intended for people who are extremely ill or otherwise... indefinitely confined.  The argument is that officials abused this law and the current covid situation to circumvent voter ID laws.  [The election commission did put out a statement that basically said ""it's up to you to decide, but don't do it to circumvent voter ID laws"".](https://elections.wi.gov/node/6788) There is no proof required to claim you are indefinitely confined.

Ultimately, the number of ""indefinitely confined"" voters [increased to 215,000, 11% of all voters, or 4x compared to the 2016 election.](https://wkow.com/2020/11/13/concerns-over-indefinitely-confined-voting-law-as-thousands-use-the-option-due-to-covid-19/)  This is ten times the \~20,000 vote margin of the 2020 election.  I could not find a number for ballots collected by drop boxes in Dane or Milwaukee county, but given these are the largest and most liberal counties in Wisconsin, I'd wager it's probably in the five figures.  It will be up to courts to decide if Wisconsin law was violated, but at the very least there are more than enough votes here that could be thrown out to swing the election.

The other claims, which seem harder to prove and unlikely to swing the election, are:

3) Per poll watchers, officials in Milwaukee county were filling in addresses for ballots that did not include the witness's address, when Wisconsin law states they should be returned.

4) Per one USPS contractor, USPS workers were backdating ballots that were mailed too late.

Personally, I expect nothing to come from this lawsuit. The only reason I even looked this up was because the claims themselves weren't in any of the local news articles, only comments that they were ""delusional"", ""baseless"", and ""debunked"", despite omitting the claims.",Keith_McPherson,,kaubu5,gfferft,0.9413633477499304,0.8604561413155396

It's called the Novel Corona Virus, or COVID-19. Don't be racist.

I'm in Ontario, and the difference in COVID infections rates is nuts, and Trump has, to my eyes, been extremely counterproductive in his response to the pandemic. The alienation of US allies - while I agree that wars in the middle east have to stop, the US *abandoned* their Kurd allies. Like, stab-in-the-back level betrayal. Trump praises dictators for their authoritarianism, appreciated that Jeffery Epstein liked his girls ""on the young side"" and said he'd date his daughter if she wasn't his daughter. He's pardoned Roger Stone and all his friends in what I see as blatant cronyism, an Arizonan sheriff who I'd say was *aggressively* racist and has general disregard for the rule of law.    
That's the side Americans should pick in November? I'm curious how you view the situation.        
There's a lot of animosity between the left and right at the moment - the way we can fix that is with civil discussion right now.
