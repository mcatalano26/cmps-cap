come to mind right now are: jokes are not allowed as top level comments; and more importantly, ""low-effort comments"" are subject to removal. The mod can define and redefine what they consider ""low-effort"" comments.

,"This article is more than a little inflammatory. So I will refer to [this](http://www.ibtimes.com/chinas-president-xi-jinping-takes-another-step-toward-third-term-office-2657301)  article which does a pretty good job establishing some facts and concepts that are not addressed.

>The post of the president of China, which Xi has held since 2012, is largely ceremonial, and since 1993, has always been held by the general secretary of the CPC. The same person also holds the title of the chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Xi is also general secretary of the CPC’s Central Committee, the center of the party’s power.

Xi holds four prominent positions in the government. Three have actual power, and one is ceremonial. The ceremonial position is the only one with a term limit, but is also connected to the general secretary by tradition. There is no hard rule that the secretary has to step down when there is a new president, but it has always been done that way. The reformist who put this in place was using the link of tradition to place an artificial limit on who can remain as general secretary. Xi is simply removing it.

This article does an excellent job, because it also points out that the real challenge is the tradition of age.

>Xi, who is already 64, will be over 68 years old by the time his current term as the leader of China comes to an end. There is no formal rule about it, but most members of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee , or PSC, (that runs the CPC) stand down from their formal positions after they turn 68. If Xi were to stay on as China’s leader beyond 2022, he would have to defy that tradition.

So all he has done is remove one of two actual obstacles in his path.

Xi's solution to this is pointed out in the next line:

,"This seems to be a very flimsy attempt to resolve the campaign finance violation questions while also claiming Trump didn't know about the payment.  Cohen takes out a loan to pay Daniels, Trump asks no questions and pays him back in installments funneled through the law firm.  Cohen claimed at first that he was not repaid, but now the president's law team is claiming the opposite.

Guliani said the president didn't know the specifics of it, but was basically just reimbursing Cohen for $130k of general expenses. [Fox especially is emphasizing how the president didn't know what the expenses were for.](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/03/giuliani-says-trump-paid-130g-to-cohen-for-expenses-over-several-months.html)

The fact that Trump was happy to pay Cohen back for ""expenses"" of $130k without asking questions seems questionable.  If true, I would want to know how common of an occurrence this is that he would pay such a large sum without without asking.

If this is an attempt to resolve the campaign finance questions, then this story of funneling money in installments through a law firm to pay your lawyer back for $130k in unknown expenses just raises more concerns.

The WHO does not oppose women's rights to use formula. Not only does the WHO not want to ban formula they even have guides on how to safely pick and prepare formula:

http://www.who.int/foodsafety/document_centre/PIF_Bottle_en.pdf

They also help ship and coordinate formula for people who need it:

http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/powdered-infant-formula/en/

This measure aimed to crack down on misinformation and false advertising, that false advertising is responsible for hundreds of thousands of infant deaths yearly. There is reason this measure has massive support around the world, from the WHO and from almost all relevant medical bodies, because it is better.

Here is the AAP ( American Academy of Pediatrics) opinion on the code:

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/68/3/432  """,Toparov,,8x2571,e20pjjo
,"Some criticism of the article follows.

First, let's walk through the facts before turning to how the NY Times presents it.

- [In 1981](https://kellymom.com/bf/advocacy/what-do-i-need-to-know-about-the-who-code/), the WHO adoped a set of rules for countries to follow that would restrict marketing of baby formula in order to encourage breastfeeding.

- [The Code](http://ibfan.org/the-full-code) would, among other things, 

- - Prohibit formula makers from advertising.

- - Prohibit formula makers from any marketing strategies like free give-aways or discounts or coupons, or giveaways of bottles.

- - Prohibit hospitals from giving formula to people unless the infants ""have to be fed"" with formula.

- - Prohibit assistance to mothers with formula feeding unless the mother ""needs"" it; and that must be accompanied by explanation of how awful formula feeding is.

- - Prohibit discounted sales to retail sellers except where the infants ""have to be fed"" with formula.

- - Formula labels have to provide negative information about the product and positive information about breastfeeding.

- - Formula labels can't have pictures of infants on them. 

- There is a lot of objectionable stuff there. For example, the notion that a woman shouldn't be free to make her own decisions is, frankly, gross. Some women prefer formula [so that they can maintain their own autonomy.](https://jezebel.com/5934750/sorry--you-cant-guilt-trip-me-about-bottle-feeding-my-kids) Similarly, it's [highly likely that the labelling requirements would violate the first amendment.](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=5d01f751-5418-4eef-b55a-f38cdf6ada13)

- Unsurprisingly, the US objected to the Code from the outset, and [was the sole vote against it when it was originally passed in 1981.](http://www.hunger-undernutrition.org/blog/2016/08/world-breastfeeding-week-2016-a-look-at-the-history-of-breastfeeding-and-breast-milk-substitutes.html)

- In 2018, the WHO [proposed a resolution](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA71/A71_ACONF4Rev1-en.pdf) calling on states to implement the Code. See OP1(3).

- Unsurprisingly, the US objected. Again.

In light of all that, one would expect to see an interesting article on the history of the Code, its tensions with the First Amendment, and a discussion of the debate over formula going on in the US over its role in women's autonomy. Lotta interesting stuff! But, what do we get? This dreck in the third sentence:

>Then the United States delegation, **embracing the interests of infant formula manufacturers**, upended the deliberations.

Mind you, this is a *news* piece, not an op-ed or even an ""analysis"" piece. And then, in the **fourteenth paragraph**, health advocates say they saw no evidence that lobbyists had any influence over what the US did.


And then we see this:

>American officials sought to water down the resolution by removing language that called on governments to “protect, promote and support breast-feeding”

Shameful, right? Well, let's look at the [US alternative draft](http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA71/A71_ACONF5-en.pdf):

>The Seventy-first World Health Assembly, having considered the Secretariat report on maternal, infant and young child nutrition, decided:

>OP1. to acknowledge the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, continued breastfeeding, and nutrient-rich, age-appropriate complementary foods for older infants and young children, as critical for child survival, health, nutrition and development, as well as for maternal health

>OP2. to reaffirm the need to promote exclusive breastfeeding practices in the first six months of life, and the continuation of breastfeeding up to 2 years of age and beyond, and recognizing the need to promote optimal complementary feeding practices for children from ages 6−36 months of age...

I guess the Times is right that the US dropped some of that exact wording, but is the above really so objectionable? And why wouldn't the Times quote some of it or even *acknowledge* that we submitted a draft resolution?

That was just an amazingly bad article, and all the worse because it could've actually been an interesting one that informed readers.",Adam_df,,8x2571,e207rpe
,"The proposed WHO rules to promote breastfeeding and discourage the use of infant formula is designed to promote the health of babies. There are numerous studies demonstrating that breastmilk is healthier for babies than formula. 

The following quote from WebMD.com is standard advice.

https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nursing-basics

""Making the decision to breastfeed is a personal matter. It's also one that's likely to draw strong opinions from friends and family.
Many medical experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, strongly recommend breastfeeding exclusively (no formula, juice, or water) for 6 months. And breastfeeding for a year at least with other foods which should be started at 6 months of age, such as vegetables, grains, fruits, proteins.""

I was born in the 1950's and was bottle-fed formula. As a result, I have food sensitivities, a common outcome of not being breastfed.  If i eat foods that trigger my sensitivities I suffer for more than 10 days. So I don't eat out. And I have to carefully monitor my food. 

It took me years to understand what was happening to me because symptoms didn't appear until three days after the exposure.

,"So if we are to actually read the study and evaluate what Trump is saying here, it should be easy to disprove his claim.

He claims:

> ...If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics.""

So to re-word his claim here, he's suggesting that *anyone who died* in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria was counted as part of the Total Excess Mortality figure. 

First of all, let's look at what the study says are the Total Excess Mortality numbers (page iii):

> Total excess mortality post-hurricane using the
migration displacement scenario is estimated to
be 2,975 (95% CI: 2,658-3,290) for the total study
period of September 2017 through February 2018. 

Next, let's look at the total number of deaths in Puerto Rico during that same timeframe. According [to the study](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/projects/PRstudy/Acertainment%20of%20the%20Estimated%20Excess%20Mortality%20from%20Hurricane%20Maria%20in%20Puerto%20Rico.pdf) (on page 8):

> The PRVSR documented 16,608 deaths from September 2017 to February 2018—9,054 males and 7,554 females. Approximately 77% were older adults (65+ years), and 18% resided in the municipalities with low socioeconomic development. We estimated that in mid-September 2017 there were 3,327,917 inhabitants and in mid-February 2018 this number was 3,048,173 inhabitants of Puerto Rico, a total population reduction of approximately 8%. This was factored into the migration “displacement scenario” and compared with the “census scenario.” 

So PRVSR recording over 16,000 deaths from September to February, yet the study only attributes roughly 3,000 to the Total Excess Mortality. That right there seems to directly prove Trump's claim is false - because if the study was adding anyone who ""died for any reason, like old age"", the total deaths ""attributed"" to Hurricane Maria would be roughly 16,000 and not roughly 3,000.

The study goes even further, explaining why the 64 death count provided by the government initially was particularly low (page 11):

> The official government estimate of 64 deaths from the hurricane is low primarily
because the conventions used for causal attribution only allowed for classification
of deaths attributable directly to the storm, e.g., those caused by structural collapse,
flying debris, floods and drownings (see below). During our broader study, we
found that many physicians were not oriented in the appropriate certification
protocol.This translated into an inadequate indicator for monitoring mortality in the
hurricane’s aftermath. Verification of attribution takes time, while excess mortality
estimation is a more immediate indicator. 

In conclusion, Trump's baseless claim that the study flubbed numbers and added anyone to the list of deaths, including those who simply died as a result of old age, is easily proven false by looking at the study data. Fortunately, the study provides the total number of deaths during the period of aftermath of Hurricane Maria, and that number (~16,000) is a lot higher than the Total Excess Mortality number they use to estimate the deaths attributed to the Hurricane and the response by the government (~3,000).",AFlaccoSeagulls,,9fj3m8,e5wxscm
,"Are there studies of other recent US hurricanes that use a similar methodology?  [Hurricane Harvey's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey) says it caused 107 deaths, but those appear to be immediate and not ""excess"" as this study refers to.

This is shameful from many directions... even if you feel the sexual assault is just a 'boys will be boys' thing, even if you think lying under oath is an irrelevant thing to review, the precedent being set should bother anyone who cares more about American than they do their party.  Which sadly is a rapidly vanishing portion of the population it seems.

Page 11 shows federal taxes paid and transfers received by income quintile. You can obviously see those who are richest pay an enormous majority of taxes, and receive the least transfers.

This article seems to imply a wealth tax. What's the economic motivation? If a person has a lot of wealth but doesn't make any income from it, why should it be taxed? Private equity investments, closed-end funds, and the like. Investments which are ostensibly productive, but don't get taxed until years after they are originally made. Surely taxing those investments in the meantime would disincentivize them.

I don't think we should just sit around and let the wealthy fuck everyone, but we have to be careful. At the end of the day, they have a lot of money to invest and taxes can affect how that money is invested. In the 1920s, the top bracket rates were so high that wealthy people moved their money into tax-exempt municipal bonds. I don't think anyone can argue that large amounts of capital is better invested in municipal bonds over equities. In that case, lowering the top tax rates increased tax revenue and the proportion of taxes the richest people paid.

> The 2016 U.S. presidential election was a watershed event that signaled decreasing political moderation and increasing partisan polarization, authoritarianism, and ethno-nationalism. Iowa, located at the center of the American Heartland, swung to the political right more than any other state. Multivariate regression analysis of county-level data is used to determine the relative contribution of factors reputed to have caused voters to support Trump: rurality, economic distress, and social identity. We find that rurality and social identity, but not economic distress, were significantly correlated with Iowa’s swing to Trump. Polarization along these social divisions must be addressed if the Heartland is to return to political moderation.

Attorney General [William Barr](https://thehill.com/people/william-barr) said Wednesday that he did not review the underlying evidence in special counsel Robert Mueller's report before he concluded that Mueller's findings did not reach the threshold to charge [President Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) with obstructing justice.

Barr described this approach as a standard practice in which officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) often rely on the characterization of the evidence uncovered in an investigation. 

""We accepted the statements in the report as the actual record. We did not go underneath it to see whether or not they were accurate. We accepted it as accurate,"" Barr said Wednesday while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

&#x200B;

The revelation came during a line of questioning led by Sen. [Kamala Harris](https://thehill.com/people/kamala-harris) (D-Calif.), a 2020 presidential candidate, who pressed Barr on what evidence he reviewed before determining that there was not sufficient evidence to charge the president with obstruction.

Barr noted that he was not the only one to make this determination, stating that, to his knowledge, outgoing Deputy Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein](https://thehill.com/people/rod-rosenstein) did not review the underlying materials, nor did other staffers in his executive office.

Barr, however, sought to defend his handling of the report.

""Prosecution memos go up to the supervisor. In this case it was the attorney general and deputy attorney general who decide on the final decision, and that is based on the memo presented to the U.S. attorney’s office,"" Barr said.

""We presented the evidence presented in the report. This is not a mysterious process.

>The test's rollout comes as the wait continues for a Supreme Court ruling on whether the Trump administration can proceed with adding a citizenship question.

>The administration says it wants to include the question to better protect the voting rights of racial minorities. But plaintiffs in one of the New York-based lawsuits over the question argue that administration officials have been concealing the real reason for the question. They allege that the documents of a GOP redistricting strategist show that the administration was driven to use the question to politically benefit Republicans and non-Hispanic white people when new voting districts are drawn.

https://www.npr.org/2019/05/30/728232221/gop-redistricting-strategist-played-role-in-push-for-census-citizenship-question

>The Trump administration has maintained it wants census responses to the question — ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"" — to better enforce Voting Rights Act protections for racial and language minorities.

>But Hofeller's documents uncovered through a separate lawsuit suggest administration officials were aware that including the question ""would not benefit Latino voters, but rather would facilitate significantly reducing their political power,"" argue attorneys with the law firm Arnold & Porter, the ACLU and the New York Civil Liberties Union in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman.

...

>In their letter to Furman, the plaintiffs' attorneys also say that Hofeller's role was kept hidden by Justice Department official John Gore and an adviser on census issues to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

>Ross oversees the Census Bureau and approved adding the question. Both Gore and the adviser, A. Mark Neuman, sat for questioning under oath last year for the citizenship question lawsuits. Gore, however, only recently disclosed as part of a congressional investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform that Neuman provided an early draft of the Justice Department's letter requesting the question.

>That draft letter includes a paragraph about using the Voting Rights Act to justify the question. It matches word for word a paragraph found in a document among Hofeller's files. The plaintiffs' attorneys say that shows Hofeller ghostwrote a portion of the draft letter.

Some things you can do. All users must have flair. If you don't have flair you cannot post anything or leave top comments. Later you can't comment at all. If we don't know where you are coming from we cannot know what your hidden bias might be.

No low quality comments. Only top comments with links allowed or maybe without personal statements? Either way that won't solve anything if the ""Orange man bad"" posts keep coming.

Unless you start banning people for being too left-wing you will never have neutrality here. They bully and harrass everyone who doesn't agree with them until they leave. I have seen over and over large well sourced posts that are factually correct get buried and ""WELL AKSHUALLY'd"" into the negatives simply because it was not  a post promoting liberal values. 


Look at this very thread. Someone said ""all the posts are just hit pieces on the right"" and got downvoted and some idiot said ""it's because facts don't agree with the right"" and got upvoted. That statement is a blatant lie, but the way the votes were handed out clearly indicates that the left is the problem with all of this.",Fnhatic,,cim6kf,evgnrpw

,"Hi there, just wanted to pipe up as a dev working towards some of the redesign goals. And, to not repeat all the work that went into writing it, I'm going to quote myself with some edits below on the progress and changes made. This is from a few weeks back. Essential updates since then are some progress on the delta styled awards - can make them, but some features missing. And, some testing has begun. Things have slowed down again due to life happening, but they should pick up as they always do. Please understand we're all volunteers with lives we're trying to balance around here!

> ### Why we're moving
> To most of the people in this sub, it probably appears that this project is dead and the reboot attempt has been largely abandoned. And while development has greatly slowed from the original push, it has still been going strong behind the scenes with ___ , ___, and myself. ___ has also appeared to be active on discord, but has been largely silent. The pinned submission has a link to Discord where the bulk of our discussions are held. 
> 
> ---
> 
> All this is to say that, yes, the project is still alive and a great deal of work has continued to be put into reviving one of the best subs on this site. What we want to accomplish by moving back to reddit as our primary chat board is to regain transparency to the larger community and show any kind of progress we do make. Hopefully anyone out there still watching can take some solace in that!
> 
> ### What has been accomplished in the silent days
> Really, a whole lot has been accomplished and I think it's likely to be fairly difficult to provide a high level summary of everything on here, but what is most likely prescient to the readers here is
> 
> #### Automated Monthly Feedback Threads
> The ask here was to provide a way to get feedback from users of the sub in a consistent manner that didn't disrupt any normal flow of submissions. This was envisioned to be somewhat intermittent to prevent a user becoming too familiar with the thread and just scrolling past it. Having a new thread every month also provides the benefit of a 'reset' to the conversation.
> 
> This has 2 parts to it. The first is setting up a task for the /u/AutoModerator to schedule a monthly thread. The mods should define what that message is by inviting the AutoMod as an admin and creating a wiki page called automoderator-schedule that can be essentially a copy/pasta of ___
> 
> The second part to this is the bot we're creating. In order to automate unstickying the feedback thread every month, the thread title will need to begin with '[META] Monthly Feedback Thread'. The title for the example linked above is configured to set to '[META] Monthly Feedback Thread Date_Posted' It will then be scheduled to unsticky after 2 weeks.
> 
> #### Submission Limits
> The ask here was to be able to limit the number of submissions a single user can make in a given window. This is to prevent any specific user from having too large of an impact in the direction of discussion for the sub and to encourage others to post as well.
> 
> This is configurable from a wiki page like ___. Configurable options are for the number of days to look back for a submission count, the number of submissions allowed within that timeframe, and a message the mods would like to send to affected users. Submissions that are automatically removed by the neutralbot will not count against this count. Submissions that exceed the count will be removed with the configured mod message.
> 
> #### Submission Checker
> This is intended to prevent unwanted submissions becoming burdensome to mods. There needs to be a whitelist for news domains as well as a blacklist so that when a post comes in, mods will not need to deal with these at all.
> 
> This feature also comes in 2 parts. The first is configuring the sub settings so that every post needs to be approved by a mod. This creates a mod queue for all submissions to the sub.
> 
> Once this queue is established, the bot reads the whitelist from the wiki ___ and the blacklist from the wiki ___. A sort of checklist happens at this stage
> 
> - If the submission exists on the whitelist, the bot will approve it. 
> - If the submission is on the blacklist the bot will remove the post with a message stating it's on the blacklist for the sub. 
> - If on both lists, the post is flaired Mod: Both Lists and waits for a mod to make an action
> - If on neither list, the post flair is checked.
>  - If the flair is Whitelist, the bot adds the domain to the whitelist and approves the post
>  - If the flair is Blacklist, the bot adds the domain to the blacklist and removes the post
>  - Otherwise, set the post flair to MOD: No List
> 
> #### Violation Tracking
> In order to deter frequent rule violators without having to rely on moderators going by a gut feeling and half remembered violations, the bot needs to be able to track violations and present user consequences as appropriate.
> 
> For this task, we're tracking some meta data for every comment made on this sub. When a mod comments a rule violation using //rule_name then that violation will be tracked with that user. Multiple violations can occur in the same comment, but each comment only counts as a single violation. If multiple comments are flagged with violations in the same comment thread, then they still only count as a single violation, but each rule violated will be remembered. Once a certain threshold of rules violations is hit, the mods are messaged with a list of individual violations for a user and the suggested ban level is presented. 2 links are provided that message the bot, 1 accepts the ban as presented, the other cancels the ban.
> 
> Rules and bans can be configured in a violations-config wiki like ___.
> Rule definitions can define
> 
> - Name
>  - The name of the rule
> - IsBannable
>  - Whether this rule counts towards the violation count
> - TrackDurationDays
>  - How long this rule should be tracked when counting violations
> 
> Ban type definitions can define
> 
> - PriorityOrder
>  - What order the ban happens in. A value of 1 means it's the first ban to be suggested
> - BanLengthDays
>  - How long the ban will last
> - ViolationsThreshold
>  - How many violations since the previous ban was lifted before this ban is suggested by the bot
> 
> ### Ongoing Work
> #### Deltabot style awards
> This is supposed to be an award system in a similar style to the mentioned Deltabot system, but that instead tracks posts/comments that are awarded for being high merit. This currently is able to track a libra symbol (though this will be changed to something different) in new and edited comments. When this value is found outside of code or comment blocks, a series of checks is made to ensure that the comment parent is not the neutral bot or the author of the awarding comment and that the comment is above a 50 character threshold to ensure a reason was given for an award.
> 
> What still needs to be done is to determine how we want to present this award in a tangible way to the users of our sub.
> 
> ### TODO Work
> #### Good Faith Verification
> There needs to be a way to ensure a redditor has read and understood our rules and is intending to interact with the submissions in a good faith manner. The original idea for this was some kind of validation at every submission, but some discussion was had around requiring a quiz style validation before authorizing new users in the sub. This task needs to be better fleshed out and defined.
> 
> ### Integration With Cloud Services
> To the best of my understanding, we will be able to get access to a VM, which is essentially just a continuously running computer, that can scale to our needs. With this limited understanding, migrating to this setup should be trivial, but it would be unwise to not budget time to investigating this strategy since it is an unknown. ___ has called out concerns regarding hitting an off-network endpoint that may need to be addressed.
> 
> ### Future Considerations
> The current design represents what myself, a user new to both the Praw library and the Python world in general has been able to put together. There are likely to be many areas of 'technical' improvements, which are improvements that improve the code without affecting the functionality thereof. For instance, some of the structure has been rewritten from multiple singular bot projects to incorporate into a single application with distributed workloads. What ought to happen is that these ideas are better organized into appropriate units of work and areas of concern. The current design is effective largely in getting things to work without having to overhaul design late into the project. 
> 
> The longterm goals of the project should include moving towards a more reasonable pricing tier once our free session is over. It's likely that someone or some group will need to fund ongoing usage of the cloud services we will be using and the costs associated with sticking everything into a VM as we're planning to do are multitudes higher (likely in the $100s/yr) than using functions. Once deployment has occurred and the sub restored, we will have a year of free pricing to attempt to migrate to a better structure.
> 
> ### Things that other people are more knowledgeable on
> - ___ has setup and been maintaining a database for development purposes that has really facilitated the rest of the project as it is
> - ___ has also been working diligently on a web ui that hopefully he can give a better update on
> - A look and feel redesign by ___ that I really can't speak to, but that I hope hasn't been lost in the months since creation.",Zyxer22,,f8says,fip6o0h

Before I could respond with the several other sources covering the story (CNBC, Reuters, etc.) they soft-banned me for 72 hours so I couldn't reply.

There are several times something breaking happens and it's never on r/news because it has to go through an insane vetting process to get it posted.

Regarding the black/white list, have the mods considered using news guard as well? I haven't heard of the MBFC before, and don't have the time at the moment to look into it. I have been using the news guard extension for a long time now and it gives a generally good breakdown on whether a site is reliable (as you noted in the post, this is based on factual reporting, not bias).

Additionally, for those smaller or local sites that aren't covered, the mods could evaluate them as is mentioned. Since mods themselves have biases and since, at least in NP, seem to be quite fair, a solution could be to have a mod of either affiliation evaluate the site prior to acceptance/declination. A dispute could be resolved by a third mod, if needed.

Lastly, for the scenario above, clear criteria for acceptance/declination should be provided and the users should be able to appeal a decision.

,"On the paywall issue, would you ever allow/encourage users to use a (firefox) browser add on to circumvent popular news site paywalls? Even if you didn't encourage it on the subreddit level, would you allow users to post a link to it in the comments? I know this can get into ethical debates, but assuming the mods at least turned a blind eye to it, I think it would be fine to post those articles if the ability to read them is there. Otherwise, for many users it's just a headline of an article.

On rule 5, I agree with another user in that I think questions should be allowed to start discussions. In the spirit of the sub, it would have to be a pretty limited allowance, as it can encourage leading questions or unsubstantiated ""questioning"" claims, but if that becomes a problem you can always reinstate the current rule.",sinrakin,,hi2ckj,fwe44i7

I like the Washington Post, I subscribe to it, I find the news there valuable, and I want to share and support it. But I understand that's not always the basis of a conversation when others don't have access. 
In some situations you could add a comment to the post including links to articles by other news sources which aren't behind a paywall, but obviously that's not always available. If I link to an opinion piece in the Atlantic then there isn't really an equivalent article which isn't behind a paywall.
But, these are good news sources, and I think it ought to be in the interest of this subreddit to support good sources. Not to leave them out and prefer free/lower quality sources, even if that occasionally means people will find it a bit harder to read *all* the posts.",Ezili,,hi2ckj,fweo269

Rule 5 seems a bit harsh. I'd like to comment on a post, but not necessarily be debating where I'd need sources. Just something like ""I wonder how this will affect the G7 summit"" and start a discussion. Would I not be able to do that, or am I misunderstanding the rule?",crybllrd,,hi2ckj,fwdud22

We're informed by reading the article. You don't really need a second source to give analysis. This is especially true if you want to analyze an article that's been posted by you. Rule #5 means you need two sources to be able to post something and then comment on it.

,"The intensity of the outbreak in the five worst ranking US states in daily cases (Arizona, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Florida) reminded me of an article highlighting a higher predicted propensity of conservatives over liberals to use precaution in reaction to a pandemic, but found partisanship (D/R) to be a stronger factor.

>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/opinion/coronavirus-trump-partisanship.html

>The Graham-Haidt study suggests that conservatives would show a higher level of fear of the pandemic and a readiness to comply with restrictions on interpersonal contact.

>A group of four California-based scholars is exploring why this is not the case.

>In an intriguing ongoing study, Colin Holbrook, a professor of cognitive science at the University of California-Merced, and Daniel M. T. Fessler, Theodore Samore and Adam Sparks, all of the anthropology department at U.C.L.A., find a sharp split in the behavior of conservative Democrats and conservative Republicans.

>Holbrook wrote by email that he and his colleagues

>""assessed disgust sensitivity and found conservatism in our present sample predicted greater disgust-proneness. The emotion of disgust functions to curtail disease-transmission, suggesting that conservatives should, all else equal, be likely to take greater disease precautions.""

>They then “measured precautionary behaviors, such as hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing, seeking cleaning supplies, etc.” and found that

>""conservatism, measured in a number of distinct ways, positively and highly significantly predicts precautionary behaviors among the Democrats in our sample, but not among the Republicans.""

>Holbrook wrote that this apparent contradiction grows out of the responsiveness of the conservative Republicans

>""to authority messaging, from the president as well as other conservative political and media figures. There are theoretical reasons to expect that, had conservative authority figures encouraged them to do so, conservative Republicans would be as likely — perhaps even more likely — as conservative Democrats to engage in precautionary behaviors.

>Put another way, loyalty to Trump and others on the right was more powerful than the strong inclination among these Republican voters to take steps to insulate themselves from the threat of the coronavirus.

>Jesse Graham, in an email, wrote that “when people ask me the question ‘if conservatives are more concerned with purity, why are red states being so slow to act against a viral contagion?’” he replies:

>""I don’t think these political differences are due to any underlying values differences between liberals and conservatives. I think it’s due to the almost immediate politicization of the threat, with Trump and Fox News downplaying the seriousness of Covid-19, and ‘left-leaning’ reality-based sources issuing the more dire warnings.

>Ditto puts the matter succinctly: “In 21st century American politics, truth is tribal.”

>In other words, the pandemic has become another example of Trump’s mastery over his most loyal subjects, his ability to manipulate them into violating their own instincts.

,"Regarding the difficulty of policing content when you're a large platform, I really liked this internal google document leaked by Breitbart: 

https://www.scribd.com/document/390521673/The-Good-Censor-GOOGLE-LEAK

Here are the highlights: There are 2 irreconciliable positions, one labeled ""unmediated marketplace of ideas"", inspired by American vision of freedom, and a ""well ordered space of safety and civility"" of European (and, I would add, Asian) inspiration. 

> The answer is not ‘find the right amount of censorship’ and stick to it... People vary in their opinion of how much censorship there should be online, often switching their position from issue to issue depending on the latest controversy, and there’s no international consensus about how much censorial power the tech firms should enact either. Let free-speech thrive? Censor particular content and voices? Let governments decide?

> Whatever the chosen response, Google won’t please everyone, nor can it hope to escape controversy or its responsibility for how society functions and progresses. Google might continue to shift with the times - changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures). If it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential. Shifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incties users’ fury. Whatever pathway is taken - Google has an opportunity to make the most of it.

> Here are nine principles to kick-start the journey...

> * *Be more consistent*:

> * Don’t take sides - People are asking for equal treatment, regardless of politics or popularity

> * Police tone instead of content - People are asking you to oversee safe spaces that still encourage debate

> * *Be more transparent*: 

> * Enforce standards and policies clearly - People are asking for clearer explanations of censorship policies and mechanisms – particularly when things go wrong

> * Justify global positions - People are asking you to continue justifying your position regarding censorship in other markets

> * Explain the technology - People are asking you to tell them more about how your technology actually works

> * *Be more responsive*:

> * Improve communications - People are asking for more responsive customer service when it comes to censored content and complaints about bad behaviour online

> * Take problems seriously - People are asking for you to acknowledge the scope of problems in good time, and own up to your responsibilities as both a cause and a solution

> * *Be more empowering*:

> * Positive guidelines - People are asking for guidance on how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to

> * Better signposts - People are asking for empowering tools that help them identify contentious issues and content, rather than platforms that control conversations


To quote the original article at the source of the leak, it is my pleasure to introduce the original [Breitbart piece](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/09/the-good-censor-leaked-google-briefing-admits-abandonment-of-free-speech-for-safety-and-civility/), which is highly biased and a completely inappropriate source for this sub.

Reddit, just like Facebook and Twitter etc exist to make money. While they've become a platform for people to express their views, can we expect companies to forgo their prime object (make money) by allowing hate speech and thus alienating potential audiences?

Serious question: are private companies such as these required to adhere to the first amendment or any other laws or are they allowed to completely moderate their content?

An organization called Big Sky began raising money to fund these scholarships, using the tax credit as an incentive. Of the 13 schools that got scholarship money from Big Sky, 12 were religious schools. Indeed, 70% of all private schools in Montana are religiously affiliated.

>Ultimately, the Montana Supreme Court struck down the entire tax credit program for all private schools, religious and nonreligious alike. It said the tax credit conflicted with the state constitution, which bars all state aid for religious education, whether direct or indirect, including tax subsidies like this one.

,"> Nearly 60 percent of the country’s 16.5 million voters stayed away from the polls – around 12 points higher than in the second round of municipal elections in 2014.


> The civic malaise was clearly linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had already affected voter turnout in the March 15 first round, when only 55.4 percent of voters nationwide cast their ballots, obvservers said.


> Many observers see the high abstention rate as a repudiation of mayors, although opinion polls show they are still the most appreciated by the French among those holding political office.


> But the low turnout is the result of a wider political saturation trend, according to experts. ""With the exception of the May 2019 European parliamentary elections, which saw a resurgence in voter participation, we are gradually seeing a form of democracy based on abstentions in France,"" warned Cautrès, noting that while turnout is high for the presidential poll, other elections fail to motivate voters to cast their ballots.



> In the Sopra Steria poll, 38 percent of respondents said they did not vote since they believed the elections will not change anything in their daily lives, while 27 percent said it was because they didn’t like any candidate or list.


Those I think summarize it, but its a short article.

Does anyone know if France has vote by mail or anything similar? It says nearly 60% stayed away then offers a poll saying 38% think it's pointless and 27% say they didn't like anyone. Really depends on whether or not those can be added, or if there could be overlap. If no overlap, that says <5% stayed away due to coronavirus concerns.",emc87,,hjbexy,fwmf5kd

This link is some more info on shipping infrastructure, that I talk about later. 

I’m generally fine with the government owning companies as long as the government never competes with itself. The purpose of a government run company is to set a standard that others compete against. Makes for a healthy market when there is a baseline that is more interested in the sustainability and longer term usability of the service and product rather than pure profit. But unfortunately this is the Trump treasury so I doubt he is pulling some cool market stabilization move to make trucking more safe and reliable, it’s far more likely based on his record that this is a favor for some friend.

Seriously though how dope would a UPS extension that is just a shipping company be? Considering shipping is necessary to almost all Americans getting food having a baseline infrastructure to get food where it is needed no mater what would be very good in emergencies, wartime, and just when the economy crashes once again. That’s what the government should provide, safety and infrastructure. Those are what we build society on! I don’t need 17 more tanks personally, but regular food shipments to my grocery store would be nice, especially if the truck driver is given good healthcare and not overworked so our supply chain is built strong. When MAGA people say Amarica first they don’t mean it as far as I can tell, but seriously wouldn’t this be very helpful for America? This would make America stronger.",yvel-TALL,,hjimwh,fwo1su5

,"Here's a [fox article](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-george-w-bush-officials-back-biden) talking about the same thing.

I'm interested to see if all of these former officials and party members endorsing Biden will have any effect. Per the Fox article, about 13% of Republicans are disapproving of Trump, which seems low, but what would really be interesting to me is how independents or swing voters are polling.

>During the summer of 1943, race riots or rebellions raged across the country. There were more than 240 reports of organized racial violence in cities and at military bases, including battles in Los Angeles, Harlem and Mobile, Ala. Similar to today, most of these conflicts were sparked by police and deputized white civilians attacking black citizens. Violence flowed largely in one direction, with white mobs raging through black neighborhoods. In Detroit, angry whites dragged black passengers from streetcars and buses and beat them in the streets.

,"This is simply due to the delay in reporting on top of the required time for disease progression. 

So if we both get sick, test positive, and you get healthy, then we both got reported as sick on the same day. 

But while you get healthy I get really sick over the course of a couple of weeks. Then I end up in the hospital and I’m put on a ventilator for a few more weeks until I die. But even then I don’t get added to the death count because the coroner hasn’t done an autopsy to determine that my cause of death was indeed covid. 

And note that as hospitals and healthcare systems become increasingly overwhelmed the delay on those autopsies increases as well. 

So even though we both got added to the “tests positive” list last week it’ll be a month or two - or more - before I end up on the death list. 

And the spikes we’re seeing now are hitting the areas of the U.S. with the highest density of retirees. It’s likely to get really ugly, and may in fact already be happening, but we won’t know for sure for some time still.

,"I live in Seattle and watched this all unfold last night.

1.	Protestors were hit (non life threatening injuries) by an off duty cop on Olive Way in Seattle.
2.	Police then moved the protestors onto the freeway which was blocked off.
3.	Then the white Jaguar accessed the freeway, which was closed off to all traffic via blockades, by driving the way wrong down an exit ramp.
4.	You can see at the start of the video that the driver accelerates at the start, presumably when the protestors come into view.
5.	Almost immediately on twitter and reddit, I saw a significant amount of people claiming the driver was black and this couldn’t be a hate crime, that the protestors should not be protesting on the freeway, and that they hoped the car was ok and that he had good insurance.

One of the protestors died from her injuries today.

Seattle is a battleground right now with the fascists on one side and normal people on the other. Plenty of videos out there of peaceful protests being violently broken up out of the blue by the police. Subreddits like /r/Seattle and /r/SeattleWA are being heavily brigaded by alt right and right wing actors, many local and longtime residents have been able to easily pick out these people who clearly are not from here.

,"Can someone confirm this procedural question?

It sounds like the Atlanta Mayor and/or city police didn't try to control the riots.  The Governor would have the authority to send in the state police, but not to order either the mayor or city police. But State police are usually smaller organizations now, so if he wanted to enforce the law his only help was by activating the state National Guard  ~~outside aid from the National Guard~~.

Is this correct?

,"If Universities have decided that it is unsafe to be on campus in the fall then in my mind, it makes sense for the US to prohibit arriving foreign students into the country - but I think it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to rescind the visas of students currently here.

What I think is ironic is that these universities (including mine) claim to be so concerned for these students but [tuition goes up](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/harvard-to-bring-up-to-40-of-undergrads-to-campus-this-fall/) even though everyone (except the university) agrees that the educational experience and quality is greatly diminished. In my particular example (anecdotal I know), I had 3 out of 4 classes canceled because of COVID this coming fall, so I now have to take classes that I originally chose not to, and because I am graduating, will never be able to take those classes that were canceled. This is all about the money that these universities are going to lose, not about the hardships that these students face.",kevin4913,,hnh39s,fxbfsoi
,"From the official [ICE update](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during):

> Due to COVID-19, SEVP instituted a temporary exemption regarding online courses for the spring and summer semesters. This policy permitted nonimmigrant students to take more online courses than normally permitted by federal regulation to maintain their nonimmigrant status during the COVID-19 emergency.

They do not give a reason for the policy change since making that temporary exemption. COVID-19 case rates are as high as they were when that temporary exemption was enacted in much of the country. Why would they remove it now? The students clearly would prefer attending class in-person if not for the pandemic. It's certainly not their choice that the university they're attending switches from in-class to online classes.

I understand that the original purpose of the rule is to ensure that only students that need to be in the US are allowed to live here. But this is a very unusual circumstance and I don't understand why students who are already in the US on proper F-1/M-1 visas and plan to continue attending a university that they'd usually offer in-person classes can't remain regardless of what their university's temporary policy is for the next academic year.",joggle1,,hnh39s,fxcdkk2

,"God damnit.

I know that's only two words, but it sums up a lot of thoughts. 

- The presidency is now a reality show marketing apparatus

- This is not going to end well for the country

- There isn't any sign of things getting back to normal with a rational president",tomgabriele,,hnhbls,fxba7ho
,"I'm disappointed that there isn't a link to at least a transcript of the full interview. If this was some of the most coherent stuff and there's 4 hours of incoherence then there must be some more gems in there.

As a huge fan of Kanye's music, it's disappointing to see him dip more and more of a voice in politics that can be taken seriously. Especially since this is most likely just a publicity stunt to promote his recently announced album. He has a platform that could be used to do amazing things and his music has done that in the past.  His first couple of albums showed everyone that it's ok for young black artists in hip-hop to not conform to the ""gangsta rap"" identity. That continued with 808s and MBDTF, while also pushing mainstream hip-hop into different directions stylistically.

But he's always been an artist that relies on publicity stunts.  Right after Late Registration came out, he dropped the infamous ""George Bush doesn't care about black people"" line about Bush's response to Katrina.  Before he started work on MBDTF, he stole Taylor Swift's VMA award speech to say that Beyonce made the best video of all time.  And there has been smaller controversies with pretty much every release since then.

I'll just highlight some of the most out there quotes:

> Trump is the closest president we’ve had in years to allowing God to still be part of the conversation.

I guess you could spin this to be a true statement since Trump has been the only president in the past 3 years, but this just doesn't make sense considering Trump [has refused to name a bible verse during interviews](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-refused-to-name-favorite-bible-verse-2015-8) even though he's called it his favorite book after his own.

> One of the main reasons I wore the red hat as a protest to the segregation of votes in the Black community. Also, other than the fact that I like Trump hotels and the saxophones in the lobby.

The first half of this is just Kanye's usual anti-conformist attitude.  I think it lacks substance and the second half confirms it.  I do think there's a lot to discuss about black people (and other voting populations) being considered as 1 group when it comes to ""getting the X vote"", but I'm not really sure if that's necessarily a bad thing while those groups are still dealing with a lot of the same issues.  If the vast majority of the black population has a problem with racism in police forces, then it makes sense that they would all be in support of a candidate that is trying to reform police departments.

And that leads into

> That is a form of racism and white supremacy and white control to say that all Black people need to be Democrat and to assume that me running is me splitting the vote. All of that information is being charged up on social media platforms by Democrats. And Democrats used to tell me, the same Democrats have threatened me…. The reason why this is the first day I registered to vote is because I was scared. I was told that if I voted on Trump my music career would be over. I was threatened into being in one party. I was threatened as a celebrity into being in one party. I was threatened as a Black man into the Democratic party. And that’s what the Democrats are doing, emotionally, to my people. Threatening them to the point where this white man can tell a Black man if you don’t vote for me, you’re not Black.

I think this is actually the problem that he's trying to address, but I think he's also misinterpreting (fairly) the Biden quote.  The assertion that a black person isn't black if they don't vote democrat should really be ""a black person isn't voting in the best interest of the black community as a whole if they don't vote democrat."" Whether that's true or not is definitely up for debate, but I think it's a better way to phrase that point.  It's pretty clear that a lot of Democratic movements don't think through their defining phrases e.g. ""defund the police"".

> It’s so many of our children that are being vaccinated and paralyzed… So when they say the way we’re going to fix Covid is with a vaccine, I’m extremely cautious. That’s the mark of the beast. They want to put chips inside of us, they want to do all kinds of things, to make it where we can’t cross the gates of heaven. I'm sorry when I say they, the humans that have the Devil inside them. And the sad thing is that, the saddest thing is that we all won’t make it to heaven, that there’ll be some of us that do not make it. Next question.

Um, ok. Yea. This is how conspiracy theories without legs to stand on get traction.

> A lot of Africans do not like the movie [Black Panther] and representation of themselves in…Wakanda. But I’m gonna use the framework of Wakanda right now because it’s the best explanation of what our design group is going to feel like in the White House…That is a positive idea: you got Kanye West, one of the most powerful humans—I’m not saying the most because you got a lot of alien level superpowers and it’s only collectively that we can set it free. Let’s get back to Wakanda… like in the movie in Wakanda when the king went to visit that lead scientist to have the shoes wrap around her shoes. Just the amount of innovation that can happen, the amount of innovation in medicine—like big pharma—we are going to work, innovate, together. This is not going to be some Nipsey Hussle being murdered, they’re doing a documentary, we have so many soldiers that die for our freedom, our freedom of information, that there is a cure for AIDS out there, there is going to be a mix of big pharma and holistic.

Jesus fucking Christ.

> Reinstate in God’s state, in God’s country, the fear and love of God in all schools and organizations and you chill the fear and love of everything else, so that was a plan by the Devil to have our kids committing suicide at an all-time high by removing God to have murders in Chicago at an all-time high because the human beings working for the Devil removed God and prayer from the schools. That means more drugs, more murders, more suicide.

...

>I haven’t done enough research on that yet. I will research that with the strongest experts that serve God and come back with the best solution. And that will be my answer for anything that I haven’t researched. I have the earplug in and I’m going to use that earplug.

At least he can admit when he thinks he doesn't know about something.  He won't listen to economists that don't believe in a god, but at least he doesn't just say he knows the most about taxes.

,"First of all, in my opinion this is absurd, but that's not really the point of my comment.

I find it frustrating and borderline racist that people automatically assume that Kanye West running would hurt Biden's chances.  The implicit assumption appears to be that black voters would all say ""Ooooh look! A black person!"" and vote for Kanye when they would have otherwise voted for Biden instead.  I think black Democratic voters aren't dumb and they aren't going to believe that voting for Kanye is going to have any chance of resulting in a Kanye presidency.

Kanye's favorability rating is 15% among African Americans, compared to 24% among white people and 35% among Republicans.  (https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/11/politics/kanye-west-favorability/index.html)

538 covered this in a recent podcast (no transcript available but here is the link https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-how-republicans-could-boost-their-chances-in-november/), and I tend to agree with an idea brough up near the end of that podcast that Kanye is just as likely, if not more likely, to steal Trump votes by getting the vote of suburban moderate Republicans who don't like the direction Trump has been going and want to tell their friends ""I'm not racist, I voted for Kanye!""",Ardonius,,hnhbls,fxbfpjt

,"There are a number of decent items on this list, but I don't think progressives will be happy with the continued milquetoast response on legalizing marijuana.

While I'm very much in favor of the record expunging part, I think it's a mistake and a cop out to continue the current dichotomy of recreational use being illegal at the federal level but legal at the state level.  

First, this needs to be rectified in order to eliminate a terrible [racist-based injustice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRwUVovtdr0) that has cost this country generations of minority people and billions if not trillions of dollars that otherwise can be funneled into more useful things like healthcare and schools.

And to the Washington Post: [Supreme Court says much of eastern Oklahoma remains Indian land

> The land at issue contains much of Tulsa, the state’s second-largest city. The question for the court was whether Congress officially eliminated the Creek Nation reservation when Oklahoma became a state in 1907.

> In a 5-to-4 decision, the court said that Congress “has not said otherwise” and that the land promised to the Creek Nation is still a reservation.

> “If Congress wishes to withdraw its promises, it must say so. Unlawful acts, performed long enough and with sufficient vigor, are never enough to amend the law,” wrote Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who was joined by the court’s liberal justices.",Ezili,,ho59s9,fxfk0wo

>Oklahoma replies that its situation is different because the affected population here is large and many of its residents will be surprised to find out they have been living in Indian country
this whole time. But we imagine some members of the 1832
Creek Tribe would be just as surprised to find them there.",atlas1171,,ho59s9,fxgddh8
,"The big question I have is about all the implications of this. 

* [In another reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/ho59s9/us_supreme_court_deems_half_of_oklahoma_a_native/fxg18ig/), user Foulpudding mentions tax implications. Gorsuch stated that this ruling is ['for the purposes of federal criminal law'](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/09/889562040/supreme-court-rules-that-about-half-of-oklahoma-is-indian-land). Just how much will it impact civil law and how quickly is a big question mark.


* That same NPR article states ""The ruling will affect lands of the Muscogee and four other Oklahoma tribes with identical treaties. Civil court issues are also affected."", but doesn't go into any detail about what they think that means or cite sources for a claim with enormous implications. Does anyone have a source with more information on this where an Indian law specialist or at least an experienced OK-area civil law attorney expounds on it?

Near as I can tell, the criminal implications are: 

* Tribe members can have their sentences overturned (and maybe retried based on the decisions of the tribe and the federal government) if the crime occurred on tribal land. https://newrepublic.com/article/157676/supreme-court-scared-tribal-sovereignty (written before the verdict but covering this court case's deliberations) indicates 'fewer than 10 percent of cases would qualify for a new trial'. 

* Going forward, according to that NPR article above, tribe members will be arraigned and have their cases heard by the tribe if they aren't major crimes (which need to be heard federally). That seems like it requires infrastructure to be built for the tribal court system in a bunch of new areas and it potentially complicates things like arresting protesting tribe members for activism to benefit the tribe (in other words, this may increase tribe members' activism because they're less likely to have the book thrown at them for protesting). The way I read this, that means it would be a bad idea, for example, to try to run an unwanted pipeline through this land right now since you would fundamentally need to rely on the tribe to end the protest for jurisdictional reasons unless misdemeanor protest acts are somehow federal crimes? (edit: https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/ discusses a law making pipeline protests federal crimes, but that law is pending so not yet binding and its existence implies that it's not currently a federal crime)

* It also seems like this would expand the affected tribes' membership, since there's an increased potential benefit to being a member in a much larger area. [The process seems complicated](https://www.allthingscherokee.com/cherokee-tribal-enrollment-faq/#:~:text=up%20any%20misconceptions.-,Cherokee%20Nation,known%20as%20the%20Dawes%20Roll.), so I would expect some number of people simply wouldn't have bothered before if they didn't stand to gain much.",Dysentz,,ho59s9,fxhj0gz

,"I took a few key pieces from here, but worth the read. From back in December

https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-12-09/report-finds-no-partisan-bias-in-russia-probe

Inspector General Michael Horowitz said his investigators uncovered no evidence that the mistakes were intentional or influenced by political bias, as President Trump has repeatedly alleged. He also concluded that the FBI had proper legal and factual justification for launching the counterintelligence probe in 2016.

..

Horowitz said the FBI did not place informants inside the Trump campaign, but it used them to speak to a high-ranking Trump campaign official and at least two Trump campaign advisors. The informants recorded those conversations.

..

Horowitz’s team uncovered 17 “significant errors or omissions” resulting from “case agents providing wrong or incomplete information” to Justice Department attorneys.

..

Horowitz offered a scathing rebuke of how FBI agents investigated Carter Page, a former foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign, and convinced the nation’s foreign intelligence surveillance court to authorize secret surveillance of him. The inspector general, who provides independent oversight, found that FBI agents withheld information from Justice Department attorneys that was beneficial to Page, and undermined the veracity and reliability of a key source of information. It also repeatedly faulted FBI agents for relying in part on the so-called Steele dossier, a compendium of unverified allegations about Trump and Russia collected by a former British intelligence officer. “We are deeply concerned that so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three separate, hand-picked investigative teams,” Horowitz wrote. He referred “all employees” involved in obtaining the warrants for disciplinary review.

..

His investigators reviewed more than 1 million documents and conducted more than 170 interviews.

..

Horowitz largely confirmed evidence collected by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III — that the FBI probe began after an Australian diplomat in London reported in mid-2016 that a Trump campaign advisor, George Papadopoulos, had disclosed that a suspected Russian agent had suggested Moscow could help Trump by releasing damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. At first, investigators relied on gathering information from public sources and using informants to record conversations with Papadopoulos and Page, who had multiple contacts with Russian officials.",emc87,,hp0eso,fxqr5kj

,"In hopes of prompting an actual discussion about this, I just want to include the text of the [White House statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grant-clemency-roger-stone-jr/) made the day before this Op Ed by Mueller was released: 

>Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency commuting the unjust sentence of Roger Stone, Jr.

>Roger Stone is a victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency.  There was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign, or the Trump Administration, with Russia.  Such collusion was never anything other than a fantasy of partisans unable to accept the result of the 2016 election.  The collusion delusion spawned endless and farcical investigations, conducted at great taxpayer expense, looking for evidence that did not exist.  As it became clear that these witch hunts would never bear fruit, the Special Counsel’s Office resorted to process-based charges leveled at high-profile people in an attempt to manufacture the false impression of criminality lurking below the surface.  These charges were the product of recklessness borne of frustration and malice.This is why the out-of-control Mueller prosecutors, desperate for splashy headlines to compensate for a failed investigation, set their sights on Mr. Stone.  Roger Stone is well known for his nearly 50 years of work as a consultant for high-profile Republican politicians, including President Ronald Reagan, Senator Bob Dole, and many others.  He is also well known for his outspoken support for President Donald J. Trump and opposition to Hillary Clinton.

>Mr. Stone was charged by the same prosecutors from the Mueller Investigation tasked with finding evidence of collusion with Russia.  Because no such evidence exists, however, they could not charge him for any collusion-related crime.  Instead, they charged him for his conduct during their investigation.  The simple fact is that if the Special Counsel had not been pursuing an absolutely baseless investigation, Mr. Stone would not be facing time in prison.

>In addition to charging Mr. Stone with alleged crimes arising solely from their own improper investigation, the Mueller prosecutors also took pains to make a public and shameful spectacle of his arrest.  Mr. Stone is a 67-year-old man, with numerous medical conditions, who had never been convicted of another crime.  But rather than allow him to surrender himself, they used dozens of FBI agents with automatic weapons and tactical equipment, armored vehicles, and an amphibious unit to execute a pre-dawn raid of his home, where he was with his wife of many years.  Notably, CNN cameras were present to broadcast these events live to the world, even though they swore they were not notified—it was just a coincidence that they were there together with the FBI early in the morning.

>Not only was Mr. Stone charged by overzealous prosecutors pursing a case that never should have existed, and arrested in an operation that never should have been approved, but there were also serious questions about the jury in the case.  The forewoman of his jury, for example, concealed the fact that she is a member of the so-called liberal “resistance” to the Trump Presidency.  In now-deleted tweets, this activist-juror vividly and openly attacked President Trump and his supporters.

>Mr. Stone would be put at serious medical risk in prison.  He has appealed his conviction and is seeking a new trial.  He maintains his innocence and has stated that he expects to be fully exonerated by the justice system.  Mr. Stone, like every American, deserves a fair trial and every opportunity to vindicate himself before the courts.  The President does not wish to interfere with his efforts to do so.  At this time, however, and particularly in light of the egregious facts and circumstances surrounding his unfair prosecution, arrest, and trial, the President has determined to commute his sentence.  Roger Stone has already suffered greatly.  He was treated very unfairly, as were many others in this case.  Roger Stone is now a free man!",petielvrrr,,hpjk4b,fxt81xx
,"Full text for anyone who’s reached their monthly WaPo article limit:

**Robert Mueller: Roger Stone remains a convicted felon, and rightly so**

Robert S. Mueller III, July 11, 2020

*Robert S. Mueller III served as special counsel for the Justice Department from 2017 to 2019.*

“The work of the special counsel’s office — its report, indictments, guilty pleas and convictions — should speak for itself. But I feel compelled to respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office. The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so.

Russia’s actions were a threat to America’s democracy. It was critical that they be investigated and understood. By late 2016, the FBI had evidence that the Russians had signaled to a Trump campaign adviser that they could assist the campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to the Democratic candidate. And the FBI knew that the Russians had done just that: Beginning in July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails stolen by Russian military intelligence officers from the Clinton campaign. Other online personas using false names — fronts for Russian military intelligence — also released Clinton campaign emails.

Following FBI Director James B. Comey’s termination in May 2017, the acting attorney general named me as special counsel and directed the special counsel’s office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The order specified lines of investigation for us to pursue, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. One of our cases involved Stone, an official on the campaign until mid-2015 and a supporter of the campaign throughout 2016. Stone became a central figure in our investigation for two key reasons: He communicated in 2016 with individuals known to us to be Russian intelligence officers, and he claimed advance knowledge of WikiLeaks’ release of emails stolen by those Russian intelligence officers.

We now have a detailed picture of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. The special counsel’s office identified two principal operations directed at our election: hacking and dumping Clinton campaign emails, and an online social media campaign to disparage the Democratic candidate. We also identified numerous links between the Russian government and Trump campaign personnel — Stone among them. We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities. The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.

Uncovering and tracing Russian outreach and interference activities was a complex task. The investigation to understand these activities took two years and substantial effort. Based on our work, eight individuals pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial, and more than two dozen Russian individuals and entities, including senior Russian intelligence officers, were charged with federal crimes.

Congress also investigated and sought information from Stone. A jury later determined he lied repeatedly to members of Congress. He lied about the identity of his intermediary to WikiLeaks. He lied about the existence of written communications with his intermediary. He lied by denying he had communicated with the Trump campaign about the timing of WikiLeaks’ releases. He in fact updated senior campaign officials repeatedly about WikiLeaks. And he tampered with a witness, imploring him to stonewall Congress.

The jury ultimately convicted Stone of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress and tampering with a witness. Because his sentence has been commuted, he will not go to prison. But his conviction stands.

Russian efforts to interfere in our political system, and the essential question of whether those efforts involved the Trump campaign, required investigation. In that investigation, it was critical for us (and, before us, the FBI) to obtain full and accurate information. Likewise, it was critical for Congress to obtain accurate information from its witnesses. When a subject lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of the government’s efforts to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable. It may ultimately impede those efforts.

We made every decision in Stone’s case, as in all our cases, based solely on the facts and the law and in accordance with the rule of law. The women and men who conducted these investigations and prosecutions acted with the highest integrity. Claims to the contrary are false.”",petielvrrr,,hpjk4b,fxs0ihd

White House officials now want to rein in Fauci by cherry-picking instances in which they can take Fauci out of context to use the uncertainties of the pandemic against him.

> Why? Again, because Fauci is saying that things are not going well. This is obvious to anyone able to look at a graph or, more unluckily, living in one of the numerous places in the country where the virus poses a larger and larger risk.

> The Trump administration has ordered hospitals to bypass the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and, beginning on Wednesday, send all coronavirus patient information to a central database in Washington — **a move that has alarmed public health experts who fear the data will be distorted for political gain**.

...

> Hospital officials want to streamline reporting, saying it will relieve them from responding to requests from multiple federal agencies, though some say the C.D.C. — an agency that prizes its scientific independence — should be in charge of gathering the information.

> “The C.D.C. is the right agency to be at the forefront of collecting the data,” said Dr. Bala Hota, the chief analytics officer at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

> Public health experts have long expressed concern that the administration is politicizing science and undermining the disease control centers; four former C.D.C. directors, spanning both Republican and Democratic administrations, said as much in an opinion piece published Tuesday in The Washington Post. The data collection shift reinforced those fears.

> **“Centralizing control of all data under the umbrella of an inherently political apparatus is dangerous and breeds distrust,” said Nicole Lurie, who served as assistant secretary for preparedness and response under former President Barack Obama. “It appears to cut off the ability of agencies like C.D.C. to do its basic job.”**

> News of the change came as a shock inside the C.D.C., which has long been responsible for gathering public health data, according to two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.

[Trump administration recommends the National Guard as an option to help hospitals report coronavirus data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/13/trump-administration-recommend-national-guard-an-option-help-hospitals-report-covid-19-data/):

> Some experts said the move could further marginalize the CDC, the government’s premier public health agency, at a time when the pandemic is worsening in most of the country, with records falling day by day of new infections.

> “I worry greatly about cutting CDC out of these reporting efforts,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Health Security. “I see little benefit from separating reporting of hospitalizations from reporting of cases, which CDC currently coordinates.”

...

> 
“Given our track record of being cooperative to evolving data requests, it’s perplexing that the possibility of using the National Guard has been suggested,” said Rick Pollack, president of the American Hospital Association. “It makes no sense. Certainly the expertise of the National Guard can be used in a more productive way.”

...

> “As a practical matter, I cannot imagine how the National Guard would be able to collect data at the hospital itself nor the number of Guards who would be exposed to COVID-19 in the process,” [HHS general counsel Robert P. Charrow] wrote in one email. In another email earlier that day, he said, “I believe that using National Guard troops to gather these data would be counter-productive.”

> According to one of the senior hospital industry officials, the possibility of bringing in the National Guard was broached at meetings June 26 and July 8 between Trump administration officials and hospital industry leaders — initially by Birx. “We just ignored it and said it’s silly,” said the hospital industry official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.

> “It was an offhand threat,” the industry official said. The official said Birx and representatives of HHS were expressing “undue frustration” at hospitals, mistakenly asserting that hospitals were not properly reporting data when, in reality, all but a few hospitals have been doing so. It was the HHS system on the receiving end that was flawed, the industry official said.

,"[The original government request from HHS (in PDF)](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf).

Some excerpts:

>On March 29, 2020, Vice President Pence sent a letter to hospital administrators across the country requesting daily data reports on testing, capacity and utilization, and patient flows to facilitate the public health response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).

>hospitals may be relieved from reporting directly to the Federal Government if they receive a written release from the State stating that the State will collect the data from the hospitals and take over Federal reporting responsibilities.

>Facilities can report to their State if they have received a written release from the State and the State has received written certification from their ASPR Regional Administrator to take over Federal reporting responsibilities. 

In theory, I think this request could be outright ignored by hospital administrators.

Additionally, they could either pursue a written release to report to the State legislature directly. Even if a hospital is submitting data directly to the federal government, nothing would theoretically prevent them from *also* submitting the data to the State legislature to ensure there's no data fuckery about.

>Government officials, academic researchers and media outlets launched data-collection projects around that time to better understand the frequency of police violence and the risk factors that contribute to it. From these growing data sets come some disturbing findings. About 1,000 civilians are killed each year by law-enforcement officers in the United States. By one estimate, Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police during their lifetime. And in another study, Black people who were fatally shot by police seemed to be twice as likely as white people to be unarmed.

>“We have enough evidence that tells us that action needs to be taken,” says Justin Nix, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha. “One thousand deaths a year does not have to be normal.” Since Nature reported last September on what the data say about racial bias and police killings, new evidence has continued to support a link. Data from California show that police stopped and used force against Black people disproportionately, compared with other racial groups, in 2018 (see go.nature.com/2bgfrah).

In a world where people are already discussing universal basic income and technology is advancing so rapidly that it has and will continue to put huge portions of people out of traditional work, I don't necessarily see this as a problem. Rather, it's more cause and effect. Fertility started dropping because (along with reduced childhood deaths) we don't need to have 6 kids to pick our food anymore. That trend will continue.

Trump's response: ""He made a statement representing himself. He shouldn't be doing that. No, I have a very good relationship with Anthony.""

The president added that ""we're all on the same team, including Dr. Fauci.""

But I think the tell is what happens to Navarro. If he gets little more than a public slap on the wrist, (which it appears that is all he is getting) then the white house isn't serious about defending Fauci.  At which point I can't think of any reason to allow the smearing of Fauci except you want him out, but you don't want to do it yourself.  As others have mentioned, Trump is unhappy with the fact that Fauci disagrees with him, but politically, Fauci is popular with the electorate.

>Lane tells Floyd to get out of the car, pulls Floyd's hands behind his back and **cuffs him just about two minutes after he'd approached the vehicle.**

...

>**Floyd tells them that he just got over COVID-19, that he's claustrophobic and has anxiety. Floyd begs the officers not to put him in the back, at one point telling them he'll get into the squad if they let him count to three.**

...

>About a minute later, Kueng tries to push Floyd into the squad while Lane pulls him from the other side. Floyd is splayed across the back seat, frantic and yelling. At least twice while being forced into the squad, Floyd says, ""I can't breathe,"" and **tells the officers he'll lie on the ground instead.**

>Officer Derek Chauvin arrives on Lane's side of the car. Floyd's body comes out of the car — it's not clear from the video if he's pulled out or pushes himself out — and he goes to the ground near the squad's back tire.

>Chauvin kneels on his neck, even as bystanders gather and yell that they're killing Floyd. Floyd calls out ""mama"" repeatedly — his family has said she died about two years ago.

>""Just leave him""

>**Lane asks multiple times whether they should roll him on his side, but Chauvin says to ""just leave him."" Kueng checks Floyd's pulse, and says ""he can't find one.""**

>Several minutes after Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck, an EMT arrives and Chauvin gets up.

>The choice of restraint didn't fall in line with what police are taught in training, said Montgomery County Police Captain Sonia Pruitt.

>""You use the force necessary to have someone comply and take them into custody,"" Pruitt, who is chairwoman of the National Black Police Association, said. ""This man was already in handcuffs and already on the ground. (Restraining him) was total excessive force.""

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-police-rendered-44-people-unconscious-neck-restraints-five-years-n1220416

>The version of the Minneapolis Police Department's policy manual that is available on-line, however, does permit the use of neck restraints that can render suspects unconscious, and the protocol for their use has not been updated for more than eight years.

...

>The on-line version of the policy manual says, ""The unconscious neck restraint shall only be applied … 1. On a subject who is exhibiting active aggression, or; 2. For life saving purposes, or; 3. **On a subject who is exhibiting active resistance in order to gain control of the subject; and if lesser attempts at control have been or would likely be ineffective.""**

Sure seems to me that there were other avenues offered during the scene by both the officers and Floyd to better control the situation.",fukhueson,,hs5x4y,fy9gtfc

,"The article didn't state one way or the other, but I'm curious if the probation violation was framed as a truancy issue.

As someone who supports educators for a living, attendance data is always one of the school district's biggest concerns. It's directly tied to funding, and if something goes wrong with tracking it, it's a huge deal.

Not that it makes the above situation any less ridiculous, but I wonder if it happened because the state changed reporting requirements due to covid. So if the student isn't doing work, they aren't counted as present. - Running afoul of truancy laws.",sjhsuihijhskjiojoij,,hsjsqx,fyb7c9p
,"She was convicted of theft.

She was granted probation instead of jail. She violated the probation by not doing her homework and not having a good excuse.

Probation works like that. You don't need to do anything illegal to violate probation. You merely need to violate the terms of the probation, which can include doing your schoolwork.

https://www.browninglonglaw.com/library/common-violations-and-consequences-of-probation.cfm

IIRC, a judge in the South was known for having ridiculous probation rules like not getting pregnant. But it seems to be common for judges to revoke probation if the defendant spends a substantial amount of time unemployed.

To understand why this is allowed, you have to consider that nobody has a right to probation instead of jail or prison. So the court makes probation a tool to try to reform the person outside of jail rather than have them sitting in jail. And unfortunately, the courts are abysmal for providing mental health resources.

,"I'm honestly curious on everyone's thoughts on this. Obviously opening schools would spread the disease and that's not good, but how does that get weighed against the fact that being out of the school system for that long is going to put some seriously problematic developmental problems in the laps of these kids in a few years?

I also worry that parents don't have the expertise needed to actually teach kids like teachers do (even if they might be learning more practical things ""on the farm"" so to speak) especially since we've built a system that relies on school M-F to act as childcare so both parents can get full time jobs.

I've heard some pretty crazy stories up until this point (6 year olds getting left at home by themselves, toddlers sitting on an iPad in the corner of Starbucks while mom works, etc). I honestly worry that not opening schools will cause more long term damage than the virus especially if the data coming out now saying that kids are less likely to transmit the virus is correct

How do we square this circle? I'd love a federal jobs guarantee with paid childcare but at this point it seems like a pipedream. Would it be safe with PPE, temperature checks, and massively increased testing availability for schools?",bailey2092,,hsvpjz,fyd8nkd

,"> Pompeo, speaking in Philadelphia, singled out property rights and religious freedom as “foremost” principals in a speech that elsewhere complained about the “proliferation” of protections in international agreements related to human rights.

> “We are forced to grapple with tough choices about which rights to promote and how to think about this,” he said. “Americans have not only unalienable rights, but also positive rights granted by governments, courts and multilateral bodies. Many are worth defending in light of our founding; others aren’t.”

I mean..I can't even figure out what exactly he's saying here to be honest.",AFlaccoSeagulls,,hsw9jm,fyd5df5
,"I think it can be easy to criticize this, and it should be up for debate. However, I fully agree. Here's a quick summary why...

After the fall of the Soviet Union, our (soft power) FP has been directionless. We promote freedom. That's it. But what does that mean? Well, it means different things to different people...and governments. We need to draw a concrete, specific line in the sand for policies that the US just simply won't tolerate, and follow through with punishment or rewards if violated or not violated. Therefore, for example, instead of indirectly promoting ""freedom of religion for all citizens,""  we need to directly proclaim that ""persecution in any way, supported directly or indirectly, of someone based off one's beliefs will not be tolerated."" Now, needless to say, these points need to be thought out more than a reddit comment, but creating a specified list of specific demands for free and friendly cooperation with the US need to be created so that diplomats/politicians have a basis to accuse others of wrongdoings instead of just saying ""that's wrong, stop.""

China's persecution of the Uyghurs is a great example of this. If we had a policy similar to the one I made up above, we would have a basis to call out them and enforce some sort of punishment. And instead of saying ""stop, that's bad,"" we could say ""This is a pillar of our FP and country that we warned you to not violate it. You did, so now you need to pay the consequences.""",squipyreddit,,hsw9jm,fydd2a2

,"For those unaware, Portland, as of tonight, has been undergoing 51 days straight of protests.  Recently, the federal government has sent in U.S. Marshals as well as a branch of the Customs and Border Patrol.  

They first escelated tensions when they shot a protestor in the head with a ""less lethal munition"" https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-officers-portland-protester-shot-less-lethal-munitions/

The article contains a link to a video, showing the protestor standing with a boom box over his head, when a tear gas canister rolls toward him, he picks it up and rolls it back into the middle of the street.  He raises his boom box up over his head, and is shot in the head.

This event received widespread condemnation; however things have escalated further as federal officers have been driving around in rented minivans and grabbing people and driving away.

In one documented case, where someone grabbed spoke to the media, they claimed they never were explained why they were picked up, they searched their belongings, asked if they were willing to waive their right to remain silent (they said no) and shortly there after released him. Source: https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/

>He’s a Grammy-winning musical genius. He’s a MAGA hat-wearing booster for President Trump. Wait, no — he took the hat off. But he still thinks Trump is pretty great. West’s music — sounding like an exposed nerve at times and a blood-slicked blade at others — has spoken to the black community’s triumphs and tragedies. Then he said that the 400 years of enslavement African Americans endured sounded “like a choice.” He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He proudly does not take his prescribed medication.

...

>The mistake the media makes, added Ikpi — who is vocal about her own bipolar diagnosis — is divorcing West’s most grandiose and off-the-wall proclamations from mental health. Being bipolar amplifies one’s personality while also removing one’s filter. It’s not an excuse for West’s behavior, she added, but a reason for it. So, while he’s telling Forbes magazine that vaccines are the “mark of the beast” and Planned Parenthood does “the Devil’s work,” there should be a parallel conversation about his mental health.

>“It contextualizes what he says and why he’s saying it,” Ikpi said.

>At this point in the narrative, the question of whether the media can or should ignore West is almost irrelevant. The 43-year-old music and fashion mogul is one of the most famous people on the planet right now. Millions buy his shoes, listen to his music, hang on his every tweet. He has one of the loudest bullhorns on the globe. Add to that Kim Kardashian-West’s own political muscle in criminal justice reform. Add to that her family’s collective social media influence. And West’s reach goes even further.

>What’s more, to sway the vote in certain battleground states, West doesn’t need millions to write in his name, more like thousands, according to Woodbury. Eleven thousand votes in Michigan could change the color of that state in November. Six thousand people flocked to West’s Sunday Service concert in Detroit in September with less than a day’s notice.

>The voters West could sway are the “none of the above” cohort, said Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, who thinks West’s candidacy could help Trump.

>“Trump’s play is to make the election as messy as possible in the hope that he’s got enough votes here and there,” Simmons said. “For him, the more chaotic, the more likely people will choose not to participate. And if Kanye is telling people it’s a mess and you can’t trust either one of them, that is actually a Trump message.”",fukhueson,,huke8e,fynr75r

,"[Latest polling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/19/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-suburban-voters-polling/index.html) is rough news for Trump, particularly in the suburbs:
> 
> [Biden] leads President Donald Trump 55% to 40% among registered voters. (It's a slightly tighter 54% to 44% among likely voters). The poll comes on top of other surveys last week from Fox News, NBC News/Wall Street Journal and Quinnipiac University giving Biden anywhere from an 8 to 15 point advantage.

> Biden's advantage in the polls is most evident in the suburbs, where he is earning a historic amount of support for a Democrat.

> Biden is up by a 52% to 43% margin among suburban voters in the ABC News/Washington Post poll.

> Other polls in the last month show Biden in as good or even better position among suburban voters. The latest Fox News poll has Biden with 49% to 38% lead. Quinnipiac University poll puts Biden ahead by a 56% to 34% margin with suburbanites. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll has Biden beating Trump 60% to 35% among suburban voters.

...

> The fact that Biden is doing so well in the suburbs shouldn't be a surprise. The suburbs are a bellwether vote of sorts in our current political environment. That is, the suburban vote mirrors the national vote closer than the urban or rural vote.

> Biden's lead in the suburbs is reflective of him doing significantly better than Hillary Clinton. **Four years ago at this time, Trump was beating Clinton by a 45% to 35% margin** in the ABC/Washington Post poll among suburban voters.

> In other words, we're looking at nearly a 20-point improvement for Biden versus where Clinton was at this point in the 2016 campaign.",SFepicure,,hvtzb6,fyvfjyh

,"Wouldn't this make sense in the interest of fairness from the media? I can wrap my head around bad actors committing violent crimes during protests, it doesn't seem like a person trying to get context from what these videos or photographs may or may not contain is unreasonable.

While I certainly agree that a major function of the media is to hold government agencies, including the police, accountable, their primary function is to report the news. Politicizing it by withholding one side's bad acts and emphasizing the other is a very slippery slope, and that's essentially how we ended up with media outlets towing party lines and telling people what to think instead of letting people determine it on their own.

Feel free to let me know if I'm missing the mark here, I simply believe that in a situation as divisive as this one, the media should be reporting both sides, not just ""protesters bad"" or ""police bad.""",faustrex,,hx0e81,fz3vrck

,">It used to be in the old days before this, you’d write a letter and you’d say, ‘this letter is really bad,’ you put it on your desk and you go back tomorrow and you say, ‘oh, I’m glad I didn’t send it,’” Trump told Barstool Sports’ founder Dave Portnoy.

>“But we don’t do that with Twitter. 

So basically he has severe impulse issues, and hasn't learned to control them on a twitter account (or I imagine any instagratification system) but claims to be able to manage them in slower mediums. Furthermore, he claims later that he doesn't realize what he retweets is 'wrong' which is not completely a shock, a lot older Americans tend to have issues [with this](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/older-adults-are-especially-prone-to-social-media-bubbles/). 

Even in the real world I feel like most people don't usually seek out conflict, and prefer like minded people (high school cliches come to mind) but on the world of social media, [its a whole other world of hell](https://www.ceu.edu/article/2019-03-14/media-echo-chambers-increase-polarization-society).

Still, one expects higher from the elected leader, I would think. I certainly do. I know Obama and Bush (and others) have said things they regret or wish they could take back, but I don't feel like they would have half Trump issues. Which comes back to impulse control and professionalism.",Mist_Rising,,hxfb5w,fz63xfh

How Local Covid Deaths Are Affecting Vote Choice

A rise in coronavirus-related deaths in a given community tends to reduce support for Republicans.

By Lynn Vavreck and Christopher Warshaw

July 28, 2020Updated 9:12 a.m. ET

On March 18, Donald J. Trump declared himself a wartime president against “the invisible enemy” of coronavirus and invoked the Defense Production Act. Now he’s facing a downside of presiding over a war: American casualties.
In the days since that pronouncement, Covid-19 has taken the lives of almost 150,000 Americans, many more than have died in recent wars combined. Data from over 328,692 interviews in 3,025 counties across the nation suggest that coronavirus-related deaths, like casualties of war, are hurting the president’s approval rating and may cost him and his party votes.

The gap between stated voting support for Mr. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. grows by about 2.5 percentage points in Mr. Biden’s favor when a county has extremely high levels of coronavirus-related deaths relative to when it has low levels. These changes may come within counties as the number of virus-related deaths change, or across counties at any given point in time. For example, Covid-19 fatalities exploded in Wayne County in Michigan in April, suggesting a 1.25-point expansion of the gap between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden.

Cases in Maricopa County, in Arizona, have nearly quadrupled in the last two months, suggesting an 0.6-point increase in the vote support gap between the candidates. Other places have seen little impact from Covid-19, such as Wyoming and some Plains states. Our data show that Mr. Trump has continued to do well in those states, perhaps even increasing his share of the vote in recent months.
Republicans running for the U.S. House and Senate lose just as much support as Mr. Trump does when deaths rise locally. It may feel as if all politics is national, but it is not.

Thanks for reading The Times.


Research shows that when people are killed in action during wartime, residents of the place the victims are from tend to hold elected leaders in Congress and the White House accountable. Political scientists have found this to be true for midterm and presidential elections during the Civil War, the Vietnam War, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Coronavirus-related deaths seem to be having a similar effect.


It’s also true that partisan leanings have influenced views on the nation’s current crises. July data from the Pew Research Center show a wide divide between Democrats and Republicans on coronavirus. Only 46 percent of Republicans say the outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. public, compared with 85 percent of Democrats who do.
Still, reactions to the pandemic are about more than being a Democrat or Republican. The front lines of the fight against Covid-19 are in local communities where sick people try to get tested and endure quarantine; where some succumb to the disease, often alone; and where doctors fight to provide care.

To understand whether these community-level experiences are affecting people’s views of the president and his party, we need local-level data on both Covid-19 deaths and people’s views of Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans over time — as the death tolls change place to place. This is a challenge; a typical poll of 1,000 people cannot deliver sufficiently granular data. There are more than 3,000 counties in the country, and the death tolls are changing in each of them in different ways every week.
The Democracy Fund + U.C.L.A. Nationscape Project has been interviewing 6,250 people a week since July 2019. To date, there are more than 300,000 completed interviews spanning every state in the country and most counties. The survey is conducted online and is fielded by the market research firm Lucid.

The data contain more cases in big places like Los Angeles County than in small ones, like Grafton County, N.H., but there are enough people in counties with varying rates of Covid-19 deaths over time to investigate whether a relationship exists.
For our analyses, people in the survey are assigned their county’s per-capita 60-day cumulative number of Covid-19 deaths. The 60-day period is that just preceding the date each person was interviewed. In this way, we capture variation in county-level deaths within counties because people in the same county are interviewed on different days.
Similarly, because people have been interviewed all over the country on the same dates, we also have captured variation across counties at the same moment. Some counties had high Covid-19 death rates in April, while others did not. As we moved into May and June, a different set of counties experienced rising rates. The goal is to figure out whether the differences in Covid-19 deaths per capita in a county at a given point in time are affecting how people plan to vote in 2020 and how they rate the president. (We also try to account for possible confounding factors that might also be changing broadly at the same time: See more on the methodology at bottom.)
The analyses reveal clear patterns across multiple levels of geography (states and counties) and different offices (president, Senate and House). Local coronavirus fatalities are hurting Republicans running for federal offices.

A doubling of cases per capita in a county over the last 60 days drops Mr. Trump’s two-party vote margin against Mr. Biden by a third of a percentage point — a seemingly small gap, but not when you consider that several recent elections have been won by narrow margins. In 2016, the critical state of Michigan was won by less than a third of a point; Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were won by less than a point. And some places are seeing a tripling or quadrupling of cases.

The news for Republicans running for the House and Senate is equally bad.
A number of swing Senate elections are in states that have experienced recent rises in Covid-19 cases, including Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina. In Arizona, for example, the gap between Senator Martha McSally, the Republican, and her Democratic challenger, Mark Kelly, continues to grow as the state has surpassed 3,300 virus-related deaths (up from 941 on June 2). Local virus fatalities are costing Republicans running for Senate as much as they are costing the president, in a year when Republicans are fighting to hold on to a majority in the chamber.
There are less than 100 days until Election Day, and many Americans will vote even earlier. Voters appear to be holding the president and his party accountable for the increasing number of deaths in communities around the country. Reducing the toll of the virus is in everyone’s best interest in terms of public health. For Republicans, it is also crucial to their electoral prospects.

More on the methodology: The data on virus-related deaths come from The New York Times coronavirus tracking project, which we merge to the Nationscape survey data by county. We tried to account for other factors that might be changing everywhere at the same time, like the Black Lives Matter protests, or things that might be specific to one particular county, like its pre-existing level of support for the president. We use a method that controls for these differences across time and across counties, helping us to isolate the effects of Covid-19 deaths on vote. (We also account for some things about the people in the surveys, like their age, race, gender, ethnicity, education and 2016 vote choice).
By doing this, we try to be sure that the relationships we’ve uncovered aren’t being driven by characteristics of the people we have interviewed or things like how many Democrats live in a county or the fact that case counts went up at the same time protests swept the nation in many places.

,"The most relevant quotes from the article:

> Police identified ""Umbrella Man"" thanks to a tip that came via e-mail last week, Christensen said.

> The Star Tribune could not independently verify the police account, which has so far only surfaced in the search warrant, and isn't naming the man because so far he has not been charged with a crime. The man, who has a criminal history that includes convictions of domestic violence and assault, did not respond to messages seeking comment. Spokespersons for the Minneapolis Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is also involved in the investigation, declined to comment.

> At the time, activists seized on the footage as proof that outside ""provocateurs"" were trying to derail what had been a mostly peaceful demonstration. But others on social media pointed out that at least some looting had gone on before the video surfaced.

> Christensen wrote in the affidavit that she watched ""innumerable hours"" of videos on social media platforms to try to identify ""Umbrella Man,"" to no avail. Investigators finally caught a break when a tipster e-mailed the MPD identifying him as a member of the Hells Angels biker gang who ""wanted to sow discord and racial unrest by breaking out the windows and writing what he did on the double red doors,"" she wrote.",SharpBeat,,hzl8el,fzkxpm9

>Outside agitator is a racial term. The term means that protests are somehow less legitimate and really run by people who are, not black, usually white people, who are not local — people who are from different parts of the country or different parts of the world.

>You may have seen people talk about Russian influence recently, fomenting this discussion. There’s another group they mention, which is seen as a predominately white organization. All these groups are, whether it’s Russia, whether it’s antifa, the idea is that anything that’s formidable really couldn’t be pulled off by local black activists or protesters. That’s actually the bottom line.

>So, back in Ferguson, the outside agitator [that was raised] was George Soros. There’s an idea that these were paid protesters, it’s not legitimate, they are being paid to protest. Fox News was involved in promulgating that misnomer. I used to tell people — back then, if people were getting paid checks, I was wondering where my check was, because I never got a check. Nobody I know received a check.

>In Ferguson, it was the same situation: It’s an effective tool because not only do you delegitimize the protest itself, but you also delegitimize the activists as not being skillful enough, or clever enough, to do this on their own. You play on racial tropes as well.

>Hostility toward the protesting can be justified easier. Legitimate protesting based on a legitimate problem: Being hostile toward it would make you seem like a racist. This gives you grounds for being hostile toward the protest in a way you can justify it.",fukhueson,,hzl8el,fzmds25

,"Some context for this story, 5 days ago, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order against DHS and US Marshall agents.  You can read the order here, but the judge outlined what the plaintiffs had shown, and addressed how the defense's arguments didn't hold up, and accused the defense of trying to create circular reasoning:

https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/7001472/Oregon-TRO-Federal-2020-07-23.pdf

Also interesting in that order, the judge spells it out that qualified immunity will not protect federal agents should they violate the order.

> Because the Court considers any willful violation of this Order, or any express direction by a supervisor or commander to disregard or violate this Order, to be a violation of a clearly established constitutional right and thus not subject to qualified immunity in any action brought against any individual employee, officer, or agent of the Federal Defendants under Bivens v. Six Unknown Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), notice of this Order must be widely disseminated

Since that order was given, there has been no noticeable change in behavior or tactics of the officers in question, in the ACLU brief, they have a number of witnesses (who are journalists or legal observers), with detailed accounts of events leading up to them being targeted.  In some cases, they have video and images.  I will link to the brief that the ACLU filed here: https://aclu-or.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/07282020_acluor_contempt_motion.pdf

While the article linked as the OP is a good summary, if you have an interest in the subject, I would recommend reading the orders, I found them rather interesting the way they lay out their positions (note, I am not a lawyer, and do not work in the legal profession).

EDIT: since post is locked, I have spoken to the mods and wanted to explain why, as it is locked from what I can tell due to a technical issue.  The source bias check service they use does not differentiate between buzzfeed news, vs. buzzfeed.  The source quality rating for buzzfeed (correctly) does not meet the cutoff for this sub.  It is my opinion, and I can provide multiple sources, that the quality of buzzfeed news is more than sufficient to meet any cut off for this sub, given that buzzfeed news is a top tier investigative news outlet, has been awarded a pulitzer, and has been nominated for quite a few.

It is true that SCOTUS allowed the Trump administration to take another stab at rescinding DACA. But Wolf’s memo does not purport to initiate a new process of winding down the program.

Certainly, the agency can go back to the drawing board and devise a new method of killing the program. **But neither the Supreme Court’s decision nor Grimm’s order gave Wolf the power to “limit [DACA’s] scope in the interim.”**

,"Additional coverage, *[Portland sees peaceful night of protests following withdrawal of federal troops](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/31/portland-protests-latest-peaceful-night-federal-troops-withdrawal)*

> The withdrawal of federal agents from frontline policing of demonstrations in downtown Portland significantly reduced tensions in the city overnight.

> Protesters in support of Black Lives Matter once again rallied near the federal courthouse that became a flashpoint, and the scene of nightly battles amid the swirl of tear gas, after Donald Trump dispatched agents to end what he called anarchy in the city after weeks of demonstrations.

> But in the absence of the federal officers, Thursday night’s protest passed off without major incident or intervention by the police.

> On Wednesday, Oregon’s governor, Kate Brown, agreed with the White House that the state police would take over responsibility for guarding the courthouse after weeks of escalating protests. She said that “Trump’s troops” were behaving like an occupying army in Portland and provoking unrest with heavy-handed tactics.

> In contrast, the state troopers did not intervene even when the scale of the protest on Thursday night passed the point, as demonstrators shook the fence around the courthouse, at which in early demonstrations the federal agents generally fired tear gas, stun grenades and baton rounds.

,"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/QAnon

>QAnon, also known as The Storm and The Great Awakening, is a conspiracy theory, popular meme,[6] and right wing fantasy about a ""deep state"" conspiracy against President Trump. Following on the heels of similar bullshit, such as Pizzagate (which occupies a small spot on the QAnon map below), it advances a fantastic web of deceit that wraps up Trumpism, deep state fearmongering, evil, satanic pedophilia rings controlled by the Democratic Party, investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, the Las Vegas shooting, and New World Order paranoia into a package easily and wholeheartedly promoted by internet cesspools and Alex Jones.[7][4] It originated from a series of incoherent posts on 4chan in 2017 by someone calling themselves Q.[8] The name is likely based on the US government's top secret Q clearance. The theories put forth in the conspiracy mirror anti-semitic tropes that have been used for centuries.

...

>In the Trump administration

>Trump occasionally likes to throw his most insane group of supporters a bone. At one of his rallies, he gestured approvingly towards a man with a ""Q"" shirt, and this happened because someone on Trump's team thought it appropriate to give the conspiracist a front-row VIP pass.[76] Trump also likes to retweet posts from QAnon accounts, which, while not directly related to the conspiracy, easily lead interested followers back to it. Most recently, he retweeted a post about Jeanine Pirro from an account that had ""Q"" as its profile picture.[77]

>Trump's pastry chef at his Florida retreat is very vocal on Instagram, and revealed that she sought her current job so that she could serve Trump while he takes down the alleged Democratic pedophile conspiracy.[78] Her posts also suggest that she has interacted with the president's security detail on a regular basis and shows that she enjoys baking QAnon-themed pastries for Mar-a-Lago guests.[78]",fukhueson,,i2f8b3,g0570qo

,"The entire [source document](https://www.scribd.com/document/471292844/The-Syrian-Conflict-and-Its-Nexus-to-U-S-based-Antifascist-Movements#from_embed) is drawing from individuals who fought AGAINST ISIS on the side of the YPG or other Kurdish forces and categorizes them as knowledgeable of military tactics while being supporters of left-wing causes. While I find this potentially distressing, I do think that it is expected as any organization should do their due diligence in assessing potential threats. The report indicates that ""There does not appear to be evidence of a centralized effort to give marching orders to returning ANTIFA-affiliated USPER foreign fighters once they return to the United States."" which to me demonstrates that this could stop being pursued (which I doubt but the possibility is there). My concern is that this will be twisted into a narrative by the right that ""ANTIFA supporters are receiving military training in the Middle East and bringing it back to cause anarchy"" which could escalate matters pretty gravely.",ass_pineapples,,i3il30,g0cikil
,"While the law generally prohibits intelligence agencies from spying on US residents, many of those protections do not apply if the individual is believed to be acting as an agent of a foreign power.

“Designating someone as foreign-sponsored can make a huge legal and practical difference in the government’s ability to pursue them,” explained Steven Aftergood, who heads the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. “It’s a crucial distinction. Once someone (or some group) is identified as an agent of a foreign power, they are subject to warrantless search and surveillance in a way that would be illegal and unconstitutional for any other US person. The whole apparatus of US intelligence can be brought to bear on someone who is considered an agent of a foreign power.” 

FYI - The KKK has not been designated a terrorist organization despite having numerous deaths and destruction attributed to their activities over the years.

""On May 31, Trump [vowed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52868295) to designate antifa a “terrorist organization.” While antifa groups have engaged in acts of property destruction, antifa has not been linked to a single murder in the United States, [according to](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/27/us-rightwing-extremists-attacks-deaths-database-leftwing-antifa) data compiled in the past 25 years by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

I think, with regards to Russia, everyone who bothers to continue the line of inquiry past the ""Russia supports Trump"" conclusion into the realm of what they have to gain and their motivations comes to the same conclusion that they are promoting internal conflict and will do so at every opportunity.

That said, If ANTIFA were a larger (dis)organization, it might make sense to legally label them terrorists but they're basically just a boogeyman at this point. Though I would argue that they very clearly fit the definition of ""Terrorist"".",entireplant,,i3il30,g0co3nx

> Trump: I haven’t spoken to the post office about it, but I don’t know how they could possibly be prepared.

Maybe start by talking to the Post Office, and ensuring they are prepared...

> There are also concerns that a top Trump donor now running the Postal Service is cutting costs right before the election in a way that will make the job even harder.

Well that explains why Trump wouldn't want to confirm they will be prepared.


> Trump: ""Florida’s a very well-run state. Low taxes, low everything. They’ve done a great job, really, a great job. And the two governors between the both of them, they’ve really got a great system of absentee ballots. And even in the case of mail-in ballots, the Postal Services are built up there.""

> Trump is suggesting that policies, like tax rates, affect how elections are run. Also, “the Postal Services are built up there” makes no sense. Why would the U.S. Postal Service operate better in Florida than any other state?

Just blathering, but in a dangerous, ""sacrifice future confidence in American democracy to protect my ego"" kind of way. Trump is strip mining democracy for short term personal benefit. In a few years he'll be dead, and other generations will be doing the work to recover and rebuild trust in government.

,"I believe there are a couple of distinctions between the two systems that are worth noting here:

1. In Florida, [registered voters have to request an absentee ballo](https://apnews.com/19ade6dafb5b6f82f324e4be9b12a7a0)t.  In Nevada, ballots will be distributed automatically to registered voters.  In other words, lots more ballots out there in Nevada.
2. In Florida, in order to vote by mail, an individual has to sign his own ballot and mail it in.  [That's the only way it gets counted.](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/vote-by-mail/)  In Nevada, [volunteers can collect large groups of ballots from strangers and bring them in.](https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2020/08/04/trump-campaign-sues-state-nevada-over-mail-ballot-initiative/3297017001/)  In an honest world, this is probably a good thing, but it probably opens the door to some chicanery as well.

So, you've got a lot more ballots out there and ballot harvesting is a worry.  I'm not sure if Trump is right on this one, but he doesn't appear to be inconsistent.

,"I really think sources that link to the actual text of the lawsuit are important. Too often news articles choose to filter the information for us and present a specific viewpoint. So, here is a [source that includes the lawsuit itself](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/trump-campaign-sues-nevada-over-bill-expanding-mail-in-voting-for-general-election).

There are 5 legal issues that are stated in the lawsuit. The first (and seemingly primary issue) is that AB4 is unconstitutional because it is possible that voting could occur after the election day. Given that AB4 allows for ballots received three days after the election date to be counted, this seems to me a reasonable possibility. The lawsuit claims that the average processing time of 1st class mail in urban counties is 1-2 days, but longer for rural counties. If true, then yes there is a problem here because it gives urban voters more time to vote.

The majority of the other complaints are centered around the equal protection clause. The biggest one (at least as I'm concerned) being that it allows for county/city clerks to define the procedures by which ballots shall be processed without any standards set to which those procedures should conform. Now, not being familiar with typical Nevada polling procedures, I can't say whether this is any different than what normally happens. It does seem like a potential avenue for fraud/counting problems, but I'm not willing to say it is a clear violation of the equal protection clause.",burtosbear,,i46ep0,g0ham1l

,"Reporting from the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/nyregion/trump-taxes-vance-deutsche-bank.html), emphasis added:

> The New York prosecutors who are seeking President Trump’s tax records have also subpoenaed his longtime lender, a sign that their criminal investigation into Mr. Trump’s business practices is more wide-ranging than previously known.

...

> in a court filing this week, prosecutors with the district attorney’s office cited “public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization” and suggested that they were also investigating possible **crimes involving bank and insurance fraud**.

...

> ***Deutsche Bank complied with the subpoena. Over a period of months last year, it provided Mr. Vance’s office with detailed records***, including financial statements and other materials 

...

> Whatever records the Manhattan prosecutors obtain are subject to grand jury secrecy rules and might never become public unless the district attorney’s office brings charges and introduces the documents as evidence at a trial.

&nbsp;


What is in those records? Well, certainly Trump has an [interesting history](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-deutsche-bank-donald-trump) with Deutsche Bank:

> * Deutsche Bank’s private wealth unit **loaned Trump $48 million — after he had defaulted on his $640 million loan and the bank’s commercial unit didn’t want to lend him any further funds — so that Trump could pay back another unit of Deutsche Bank. “No one has ever seen anything like it,”** said David Enrich, finance editor of The New York Times, who is writing a book about the bank and spoke to “Trump, Inc.”

> * Deutsche Bank loaned Trump’s company $125 million as part of the overall $150 million purchase of the ailing Doral golf resort in Miami in 2012. The loans’ primary collateral was land and buildings that he paid only $105 million for, county land records show. The apparent favorable terms raise questions about whether the bank’s loan was unusually risky.

> * To widespread alarm, and at least one protest that Trump would not be able to pay his lease obligations, Deutsche Bank’s private wealth group loaned the Trump Organization an additional $175 million to renovate the Old Post Office Building in Washington and turn it into a luxury hotel.

> Like Trump, Deutsche Bank has been scrutinized for its dealings in Russia. The bank paid more than $600 million to regulators in 2017 and agreed to a consent order that cited “serious compliance deficiencies” that “spanned Deutsche Bank’s global empire.” The case focused on “mirror trades,” which Deutsche Bank facilitated between 2011 and 2015. The trades were sham transactions whose sole purpose appeared to be to illicitly convert rubles into pounds and dollars — some $10 billion worth.

...

> The bank was “laundering money for wealthy Russians and people connected to Putin and the Kremlin in a variety of ways for almost the exact time period that they were doing business with Donald Trump,” Enrich said. “And all of that money through Deutsche Bank was being channeled through the same exact legal entity in the U.S. that was handling the Donald Trump relationship in the U.S. And so there are a lot of coincidences here.”",SFepicure,,i4l57l,g0j1ab6

,"“We are a cancer and there is no cure,” a successful and insightful TV veteran said to me. “But if you could find a cure, it would change the world.”
As it is, this cancer stokes national division, even in the middle of a civil rights crisis. The model blocks diversity of thought and content because the networks have incentive to amplify fringe voices and events, at the expense of others… all because it pumps up the ratings. 

This cancer risks human lives, even in the middle of a pandemic. The primary focus quickly became what Donald Trump was doing (poorly) to address the crisis, rather than the science itself. As new details have become available about antibodies, a vaccine, or how COVID actually spreads, producers still want to focus on the politics. Important facts or studies get buried.

This cancer risks our democracy, even in the middle of a presidential election. Any discussion about the election usually focuses on Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, a repeat offense from 2016 (Trump smothers out all other coverage). Also important is to ensure citizens can vote by mail this year, but I’ve watched that topic get ignored or “killed” numerous times.

Context and factual data are often considered too cumbersome for the audience. There may be some truth to that (our education system really should improve the critical thinking skills of Americans) – but another hard truth is that it is the job of journalists to teach and inform, which means they might need to figure out a better way to do that. They could contemplate more creative methods for captivating an audience. Just about anything would improve the current process, which can be pretty rudimentary (think basing today’s content on whatever rated well yesterday, or look to see what’s trending online today).",1HelluvaCaucasian,,i5d7ed,g0o7wog

#Comment Rules

We expect the following from all users:


1. Be courteous to other users.

1. Source your facts.

1. Be substantive.

1. Address the arguments, not the person.


If you see a comment that violates any of these essential rules, click the associated *report* link so mods can attend to it.

However, **please note that the mods will not remove comments or links reported for lack of neutrality**. There is [no neutrality requirement for comments or links](https://www.reddit.com//r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_neutral-ness) in this subreddit — it's only the *space* that's neutral — and a poor source should be countered with evidence from a better one.

,"**NOTE:**

This post was reported multiple times and temporarily removed. The mods then reviewed it against our [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralNews/wiki/guidelines) and decided to restore it. Here's why:

* The source site meets our requirements.
* The title matches the content of the article.

Although the submission rules also state that we will remove submissions with titles that are misleading or biased, the purpose of that is to prevent submitters from trying to sneak in content that's not supported by the article itself. 

In this case, the linked article tries to connect the dots so that, by the end, it draws a conclusion that supports the headline. Is the path towards that conclusion dubious? Perhaps. But it cannot be the mods' job to decide whether every submitted article adequately supports its thesis/title. We only verify that the title reflects the contents.

The users, on the other hand, are welcome to make arguments as to why the article is or isn't true or substantiated. Right now, there's good, topical, supported discussion within the comments, and that showcases the strengths of this subreddit over other discussion environments. Such discussion allows readers to draw their own conclusions, rather than the mods doing it for them.

We understand some users will be disappointed in the decision to leave this submission up. Life as moderators means we're always pissing off somebody.

Thanks for reading!

> specifically warning that Russia is working to help reelect Donald Trump. Even more important is what this warning unmistakably implies: that **Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are actively cooperating with Russia’s campaign**.

&nbsp;

[Statement by NCSC Director William Evanina: Election Threat Update for the American Public](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2139-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-election-threat-update-for-the-american-public):

> Ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections, foreign states will continue to use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway U.S. voters’ preferences and perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase discord in the United States, and undermine the American people’s confidence in our democratic process. They may also seek to compromise our election infrastructure for a range of possible purposes, such as interfering with the voting process, stealing sensitive data, or calling into question the validity of the election results. However, it would be difficult for our adversaries to interfere with or manipulate voting results at scale.


> Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer. We are primarily concerned about the ongoing and potential activity by China, Russia, and Iran.

...

> * RUSSIA – We assess that **Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden** and what it sees as an anti-Russia “establishment.” This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia. For example, pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is **spreading claims about corruption – including through publicizing leaked phone calls** – to undermine former Vice President Biden’s candidacy and the Democratic Party. Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to **boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television**.

...



> The intelligence assessments above represent the most current, accurate, and objective election threat information the U.S. Intelligence Community has to offer in an unclassified setting at this time.  

...

> #As I emphasized in my July 24, 2020 public statement, we are all in this together as Americans. Our election should be our own. Foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections are a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy.",SFepicure,,i5p8xz,g0qo2bv

,"I'll be honest up front, I'm white, and that absolutely affects how I view this.

I think whoever is VP is gonna have a shit show to clean up with Biden if he's elected. I think they would need to work on racial relations and police overhauling. Now, maybe a Black woman would have the chance of understanding these situations best. Maybe there isn't one that works with Biden's platform. Maybe there's another POC that understands these relations and issues that's a good fit.

I, as a voter, want the VP of any party to be the best fit for the whole nation, for as many issues as possible. That's a tall order and I'm not sure that it's a very wise thing to limit that position to one race. 

If I was chosen to be VP because I was gay and there was a massive issue with homophobia and nation wide protests, I would kinda feel like I was used as a PR prop, rather than chosen because I was a good politician.

Either way, I can already sense the inevitable backlash Biden's VP is going to get no matter who he chooses.",more_bees_please,,i5r8av,g0r60g3

,"Starting out, let me just say that seizing fake IDs and documents is a good thing. Just like news about drug seizures at the border, or people smuggling endangered lizards, or finding prescription drugs being smuggled, seizing illegal stuff at the border is good. But I want to look more at the context of this news report being posted now, and what information it actually provides 


Just in the first paragraph Fox make this statement:

> Counterfeit documents are giving [criminals](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime) a license to commit a host of offenses, including [terrorism](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism), U.S. officials say -- and young adults who are lax with their personal information may be their biggest enablers.

Linking them to Terrorism is obviously a significant claim so let's click the through for the sourcing on that... And it's just a link to the [news category for Terrorism](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism). So I guess we will never know on what basis the terrorism claim is made. Classic Fox. Make a claim, create an insinuation, provide no support


> The 19,888 licenses and other fake documents were included in 1,513 overseas shipments, mostly from China and Hong Kong, CBP said, according to FOX 5 in New York City. Others were from South Korea and Britain.

The headline encourages a reader to believe this was a large shipment from China, and that perhaps it's related to the US election. Fox doesn't make that claim in the article, but in the context of their other reporting, and that they have chosen now to publish this particular story, i think the insinuation is there.

Reading the details this was over 6 months, from multiple countries, not all IDs, and the agents believe they are being used for the same things fake IDs are always used for. Unhelpfully, Fox provides no context for what the levels of document shipments usually are over a six month period. After reading this article can you answer the following questions:

- How many documents were being shipped from China Vs Britain?

- What % of the documents were fake IDs Vs other documents?

- What is the normal rate of fake documents shipped through this airport per year? Is this amount reported high, low, or normal?

Fox does such a poor job in this story, that you leave with next to no factual context. On the other hand, you leave with a strong sense that this is newsworthy and alarming. But no actual evidence that it is different to last year or the year before. It creates a narrative, but makes very few factual statements.

So despite the timing this story is coming up, it doesn't sound like any reason to think it is particularly unusual, or election related. And it's worth reiterating that voter fraud levels continue to be [almost non-existant](https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud).",Ezili,,i6uvoc,g0zonfk

,"One has to ask, ""How did we get here?""

&nbsp;

When you look at the data, it's abundantly clear that the USA has completely fumbled their COVID-19 response. Let's compare the US outcome to the G7,

> [The Group of Seven (G7) is an international intergovernmental economic organization consisting of seven major developed countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, which are the largest IMF-advanced economies in the world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven) 

Big countries, advanced economies: should have a comparable ability to respond to a pandemic. Let's even add Russia to the group - [god knows DJT is keen to](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52885178). 

&nbsp;

Consider the [raw COVID-19 cases](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&casesMetric=true&interval=total&hideControls=true&smoothing=0&country=CAN~DEU~USA~RUS~FRA~ITA~JPN~GBR&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc). Currently, the USA has 5,040,000 cases, ***5.6 times as the next highest country***, Russia, with 887,536. And ***16 times the next highest G7 country***, the UK. 

*But, but.... different populations!*

OK, let's [normalize COVID-19 cases by population](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&casesMetric=true&interval=total&hideControls=true&smoothing=0&country=CAN~DEU~USA~RUS~FRA~ITA~JPN~GBR&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc); 15/MM in the USA, 6.1/MM in Russia (less than half than the USA), and 4.6/MM in the UK. That's... less abysmal, I guess?

&nbsp;

*These figures are nonsense! Hospitals are assigning deaths to COVID-19 when in reality the patient* ***actually*** *died as a result of stubbing their toe*!



[Assigning a cause of death is never straightforward, but data on excess deaths suggest coronavirus death tolls are **likely an underestimate**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-covid-19-deaths-are-counted1/). 

No matter how you slice the data, an unusual number of Americans have died in the last six months. The [*Weekly number of deaths (from all causes)*](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) has been *way* in excess of the typical number of deaths from all causes. 

Consider the data from the [*Pneumonia and Influenza Mortality Surveillance from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System*](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/mortality.html). There was a huge spike in 2017-2018 flu season, ""[more intense than any since the 2009 swine flu pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/health/flu-rates-deaths.html)"". The pneumonia and influenza mortality in the 2019-2020 season - *just in 2020* - is *far* in excess of the previous recent peak. I guess it's just an odd statistical fluke so many people are drowning in their own plasma in 2020?

,"Honest question here...

If this is such a big thing, and is a crime worth sending people to jail... then why hasn't the DOJ done anything about this?

The FBI reports to the AG, which right now is Barr. And whether or not you like what he's doing, Barr has done a very good job keeping Trump happy — [including commuting the case of Roger Stone and attempting to drop the charges against Michael Flynn.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barr#Intervention_in_cases_of_Trump_associates)

They currently have a very powerful ally with Barr on their side. And it just doesn't make sense that he wouldn't be all over this right away unless there was nothing to see here.

Or if Barr doesn't do anything, then Trump can just find a director of the FBI that will look into this right? He fired Comey, so get an FBI director that will look into this?

I'd honestly like to hear if anyone has any insight into what the hold up is here. The inner workings of who has what authority in the government are complicated.

,"Definitely a good pick on the demographic issues - Harris is everything Biden is not - Black, female, not as old as dirt. As /u/skankinmonkey pointed out her voting record is quite liberal, so she shouldn't push the liberal wing of the party away. 

She's also only a freshman senator that really hasn't had her national image totally defined. Looking at her [favorability ratings](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/joe-biden-vp-running-mate-pick-tracker-377652), she isn't exactly wildly popular, but the same could be said of other options like Elizabeth Warren, she does have some people that have never heard of her. She does have a much larger national profile than most of the other contenders. 

For me personally, I'm not wildly excited about the pick - mainly because it is a VP, and I have trouble believing that it really matters. On the other hand, there were a few people in the running that I really don't like (mainly Abrams and Lance Bottoms), so I'm definitely not disappointed.",Ratwar100,,i7zc4g,g15sxl7

That he is taking an action to specifically, and explicitly, sabotage voting mechanisms which Americans rely on, to maintain his office, is perhaps the most corrupt action a president has taken, or could take.

> The following scenario is not only possible, but highly likely: It’s a week from the election and millions of people finally get around to requesting an absentee ballot. They fill out the ballot and mail it back, but by the time it finally makes its way to their local officials, Election Day has passed and their votes don’t count.

> That’s because — and this is vital to understand — ***in 34 states, including the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, ballots can’t just be postmarked by Election Day to count.

If you mail it three days before, thinking you did everything right, but it doesn’t arrive at the board of elections until the day after the election, it’s tossed in the trash***.
> 
> This has all the makings of an election nightmare purposefully engineered by Trump and DeJoy. As they know full well, due to Trump’s relentless campaign to convince people that mail voting is inherently fraudulent (unless Republicans are doing it), Democrats are now far more likely to say they’re going to vote by mail.
> 
> This is election theft in progress. And as awful as that is, it’s made even more despicable by the fact that to rig the election, Trump is trying to murder a national treasure.

> The Postal Service is older than the country itself — the Continental Congress made Ben Franklin the first postmaster general in 1775 — and it remains the most popular agency in the federal government, beloved by Americans for the daily service it provides them, no matter where they live or who they are.

>>The Postal Service shall have as its basic function the obligation to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people. It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and shall render postal services to all communities.

Subject - Save the Integrity of the USPS - Dismiss Louis Dejoy 

Members of the USPS Board of Governors,

I write to you demanding that your body immediately dismiss Postmaster General Louis Dejoy for his gross and intentional mismanagement of the USPS. 

He has violated his oath of office and federal law by intentionally disrupting the operations of the USPS in order to deprive the American public of their right to vote.

The Postal Service’s mission is to ""provide the nation with reliable, affordable, universal mail service"". As a concerned American citizen I demand that you uphold the integrity of the USPS as an American institution and end the naked political meddling by a corrupt Postmaster General and avoid being complicit in the committal of the following federal crimes

18 U.S. Code § 1701.Obstruction of mails generally
Whoever knowingly and willfully obstructs or retards the passage of the mail, or any carrier or conveyance carrying the mail, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

-A concerned American citizen

> In reaction to the personnel shakeup on Wednesday, Amanda Bennett, who was the head of Voice of America until she resigned shortly after Pack's arrival, said: ""The American people are going to be very very sorry when they wake up one day and find that by these individual actions — one at a time that nobody stopped — they’ve lost the functioning government they once had.

> ""What is happening at USAGM is a microcosm of what’s happening all across the U.S. government — driving out honest, skilled, talented long serving professional public servants on trumped up charges and replacing them with people of no qualifications whose only attribute is loyalty. McCarthy couldn’t have done it better.”

> The ballot warnings, issued at the end of July from Thomas J. Marshall, general counsel and executive vice president of the Postal Service, and obtained through a records request by The Washington Post, were planned before the appointment of Louis DeJoy, a former logistics executive and ally of President Trump, as postmaster general in early summer.

There is clearly an underlying issue - lack of funding - but it sounds like there are two related issues here 

1. Not enough funding during a time when the main service is critically important due to Covid-19

2. [The President's desire to suppress votes](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/13/trump-opposes-usps-funding-394692). More discussion in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/i9210g/trump_says_he_opposes_usps_funding_in_an_effort/) separate thread

> In the two page-letter, the committee raised concerns that testimony given to it by the president’s family and advisors contradicted what Rick Gates, the former deputy campaign chairman, told the Special Counsel about when people within the Trump campaign knew about a June 9 meeting at Trump tower with a Russian lawyer.

> When the meeting became public, Trump Jr. initially claimed it was about Russian adoptions, but emails written by Trump Jr. that were later made public showed he had agreed to the meeting, but because he had been assured that the Russian lawyer had “official documents and information” that would “incriminate” Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president. The email said the information would “be very useful to your father.”

> The music promoter who arranged the meeting, Rob Goldstone, told Trump Jr. that the damaging information on Clinton was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. replied: “If it’s what you say, I love it.” 

...

> Trump Jr., Kushner, Hicks and Manafort denied prior knowledge of the meeting in interviews with the committee, according to the committee’s letter, which offered transcripts as proof. 

...

>Lying to Congress is a felony, and two Trump allies — Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, and Roger Stone, his longtime political advisor and self-described dirty trickster — were charged with the crime during the special counsel investigation. Cohen pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison, though he was recently released on home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

> Stone was convicted at trial. Atty. Gen. William Barr caused an uproar when he waded into the case and pressed prosecutors to reduce their recommended sentence. After four career prosecutors left the case in protest, a federal judge sentenced Stone to just over three years in prison. Trump last month commuted Stone’s sentence just before he was supposed to report to prison.

I'm not downplaying the importance only pointing out that the difference in rate of victimhood is [3%](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6686) according to this, though it excludes simple assault.

Rifles are number 7 on the list. **Fucking hands and feet are number 5** There is absolutely no issue AT ALL with these supposed ""assault weapons."" This is fear mongering bullshit from the Democrats once more looking to take away gun rights under the auspices of decreasing crime.

>We have a huge problem with guns. Assault weapons — military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly 

Deliberately ambiguous language. A gun is either automatic, semi automatic, or single shot. This is blatantly obscure language from someone that has passed enough gun regulation to know that.




https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/#
>Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Once more deliberately vague language, still no clue of what an assault weapon is. Must be trying to stop mass shootings. To bad only 25% are committed with rifles. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States



>the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that don’t limit the weapon’s lethality.

It's a fucking gun. It is supposed to be as lethal as possible. 

>Both candidates support programs to divert mental health calls away from police and first responders, and both propose partnering mental health specialists with police. 

I hope they're not thinking of just sending out a social worker on mental health calls. It's a dangerous situation for first responders and it'll be dangerous for them, too.

,"There seems to be some misunderstanding of what this is: 

Essentially, to get an absentee ballot, [in some States](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/), you have to fill out a request form to have them send you a ballot.

In this case, the North Carolina Republican Party (not a  part of the government), are sending a copy of that form to certain people, in the hope that people who want to vote Republican will fill it out, get a mail in ballot, and use it. Thus increasing their voter turnout. **As far as I know** (it varies state by state)  there is nothing illegal about forwarding the blank ballot request forms to voters in NC. 

The newsworthiness here is that on the one hand Trump is [trashing vote by mail](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/13/donald-trump-usps-post-office-election-funding), whilst simultaneously Republican committees are quietly encouraging *their*  voters to vote by mail.
> ""The irony is very thick and definitely not lost on me,"" Carranza told CNN. ""Trump has been saying mail-in ballots will bring fraud to the election but absentee ballots are legit. Which is it? It can't be both ways. I laughed because if the campaign actually took information from other times they have reached out to me, they'd know I won't vote for Trump despite being a registered Republican.""

And a  spokesman from the party being explicit about their goals - emphasis mine:
> ""We want **our voters** to know they can utilize this tool to cast their ballot in an easy, safe and secure manner. It is important to note that the North Carolina system requires a voter to actively solicit a ballot and go through an easy but important verification process to request a ballot,"" he added. ""We along with President Trump oppose an all-mail election process where voters are mailed ballots without a prior request and authentication.""

They  don't want an all-mail election because that would make it too easy for everybody to vote. They want their voters to register, but not *all* voters.

*Aside*
Both parties work hard to register people to vote who they think are likely to vote for them. Even organising to help them get to polling places. Again, the rules are different in different states. Texas for example has some truly awful laws about voter registration requirements - you have to be ""deputized"" to be able [to help people register to vote in Texas](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/texass-voter-registration-laws-are-straight-out-of-the-jim-crow-playbook/). These  sorts of absurd rules are typically there to supress voter turnout, which in Texas helps the incumbent Republican party because more  old white people are registered to vote. If everybody votes you have to 
 compete on ideas. If *your* people vote, you have an advantage. But I digress...



**Summary**: Trump is [falsely](https://www.nytimes.com/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html) trashing vote by mail whilst *he himself [is voting by mail](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-ever-voted-by-mail/)*

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/03/15/trump-to-pull-back-epas-fuel-efficiency-determination-opening-the-door-for-reduced-standards/

> President Trump opened the door Wednesday to rolling back fuel efficiency standards that were adopted during the Obama administration, a move that could lead to a legal fight with state regulators and environmental groups in the coming years.

> In January, the Environmental Protection Agency reaffirmed that automakers must achieve an average 54.4 mpg across their fleets by 2025. But Trump pledged Wednesday to review those standards in a speech at the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti, Mich. He told auto plant workers there that his administration will ensure the regulations do not lead to job losses and factory closures.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/climate/california-auto-emissions-trump.html

> California went on the offensive Tuesday against the Trump administration’s plan to weaken fuel-efficiency rules for cars, laying out a scathing rebuttal that the state’s clean-air regulator said would shape the battle with Washington in the coming months and years.

> The state’s target is one of President Trump’s most consequential environmental rollbacks to date, a proposal unveiled last week to let cars pollute more while stripping California of its right to set its own air-quality rules.

> Although the auto industry had asked the Trump administration to relax these standards in 2017, Trump’s move goes much further than what they asked, and is not necessarily welcome for the industry. After all, auto companies worked closely with the federal government to develop these standards in the first place.",EmilyA200,,ibnlsa,g1z9bqk
,"The headline makes it seem otherwise, but it was rather more ""we need to agree on some common standard"" than ""defying Trump!""

Companies don't do well if they have fifty different states with fifty different standards.  Since these are some of the biggest of the four auto makers, they'll be building the bulk of future automobiles (under current trends).

Personally I think this will all be rendered moot in ~10 years as EVs get longer ranges, faster recharging times, and lower prices.",TheFerretman,,ibnlsa,g1z7bgn

,"This is going to be a very interesting and dynamic election region. Some people want to make this out to be a racial demographics issue, like the author in this article talking about more minorities moving into the suburbs, but I disagree. The vote split is going to continue to look a lot more urban-suburban-rural than black-white-brown if the messaging coming from the campaign to re-elect is done properly. I would posit that black women will be just as responsive as white women to messaging revolving around safety and security, particularly in the era of daily riots in major cities seemingly egged on by a portion of the political class. 

It's weird, 9 months ago I thought Trump had a major uphill battle on recapturing the suburban vote, and COVID would have made you think it was out of reach, but images of [fires outside the Seattle Court House](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2020/07/videos-rioters-throw-explosives-molotovs-at-police-and-courthouses-in-portland-seattle-and-oakland-and-more/), of properly framed, should be a powerful image for the right right now.

,"Today the he [**Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/politics/senate-intelligence-report-russia-election-interference-efforts/index.html) released the final volume of its **bipartisan** investigation into Russia's 2016 election interference.

The full report is here,

[REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE, UNITED STATES SENATE ON RUSSIAN ACTIVE MEASURES CAMPAIGNS AND INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 U.S. ELECTION VOLUME 5: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf)

> The Committee found that the Russian government engaged in an aggressive, multifaceted effort to influence, or attempt to influence, the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. 

...

> While the Committee does not describe the final result as a complete picture, this volume provides the most comprehensive description to date of Russia's activities and the threat they posed. 

&nbsp;

I'm still reading it, but the [highlights from NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/bipartisan-senate-report-describes-2016-trump-campaign-eager-accept-help-n1237002) are interesting,

> * ""Separate from Steele's memos, which the Committee did not use for support, the Committee became aware of three general sets of allegations"" involving women, the report said, two of which described a tape. No such allegations were confirmed, but the finding lent new credence to at least one claim in the widely discredited Steele dossier.

> * The committee endorsed the view of special counsel Robert Mueller and the Roger Stone prosecution team that the Trump campaign eagerly embraced Russian help in 2016, and considered the hacked emails its ""October surprise"" even though campaign officials knew the material was stolen by Russian intelligence. ""While the GRU and WikiLeaks were releasing hacked documents, the Trump Campaign sought to maximize the impact of those materials to aid Trump's electoral prospects,"" the report said. ""To do so, the Trump campaign took actions to obtain advance notice about WikiLeaks releases of Clinton emails; took steps to obtain inside information about the content of releases once WikiLeaks began to publish stolen information; created messaging strategies to promote and share the materials in anticipation of and following their release; and encouraged further theft of information and continued leaks.""

> * **The committee said it also developed evidence that Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort may have been connected to the Russian operation to steal and leak Democratic emails. If that had been proven in court, it would have constituted ""collusion,"" by any definition**, but no such charge ever was brought.

> * The committee found that the Trump transition exposed itself to Russian influence. ""Russia and other countries took advantage of the Transition Team's inexperience, transparent opposition to Obama Administration policies, and Trump's desire to deepen ties with Russia, to pursue unofficial channels through which Russia could conduct diplomacy,"" the report said. ""The lack of vetting of foreign interactions by Transition officials left the Transition open to influence and manipulation by foreign intelligence services, government leaders, and co-opted business executives."" It added, ""Russian officials, intelligence services, and others acting on the Kremlin's behalf were capable of exploiting the Transition's shortcomings for Russia's advantage. Based on available information it is possible — and even likely — that they did so.""

> * The report said that Manafort associate Konstatin Kilimnik, a Russian intelligence officer, ""almost certainly helped arrange some of the first public messaging that Ukraine had interfered in the U.S. election."" In 2017, the report said, ""other Russian-government proxies and personas worked to spread the false narrative that Ukraine interfered in the U.S. election."" The committee ""identified no reliable evidence that the Ukrainian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.""",SFepicure,,ic1wap,g1zi3xi
,"It continues to be disturbing that there are Republicans defending these treasonous actions that go well beyond the Steele report.

>In a thousand-page bipartisan report released Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee said the **Trump administration obstructed its investigation** with ""novel claims"" of executive privilege. It painted a portrait of a Trump campaign eager to accept help from a foreign power in 2016.

>The Senate report, the most detailed account to date of the **Trump campaign's embrace of Russian election interference**, also asserted that the allegations that Ukraine interfered in the election — **which President Donald Trump perpetuated** — originated with Russian intelligence agencies.

>The report highlighted some never-before-seen evidence about Trump and Russia, including three allegations of potentially compromising material relating to **Trump's private trips to Russia** that were unconnected to the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.",hiredgoon,,ic1wap,g1zvwk7

The document is huge, but the findings summary is just few pages long, and fairly easy and quick read. I would strongly recommend reading that instead or at least before the news reports - you may find out how biased a lot of these reports are.  


Here is the super short summary:

* Russians were actively trying to find access into the campaign, but mostly unsuccessfully, except for Manafort whose conduct is certainly very problematic and suspicous, but even there it's unclear how much if any impact it had on anything
* Trump and the campaign welcomed DNC leaks but there is no evidence of any collusion or any prior to knowledge (or in fact any knowledge that the leaks were done by Russans)
* Trump's team did reach out to Roger Stone to learn more about the leaks, and if more were coming, but it's unclear if he actually had any access or if they learnt anything through that
* Few of the meetings were investigated but didn't produce any smoking guns 
* There is a criticism of FBI conduct including not cooperating with DNC and taking Steele's dossier at face value  


Even shorter TLDR: Russians actively tried to influence the elections, no collusion, FBI fucked up.",catch-a-stream,,ic1wap,g21xor1

Findings about Manafort include,

* Manafort hired and worked increasingly closely with a Russian national, Konstantin Kilimnik. Kilimnik is a Russian intelligence officer. Kilimnik became an integral part of Manafort's operations in Ukraine and Russia, serving as Manafort's primary liaison to Deripaska and eventually managing Manafort's office in Kyiv. Kilimnik and Manafort formed a close and lasting relationship that endured to the 2016 U.S. elections. and beyond. 

* Prior to joining the Trump Campaign in March 2016 and continuing throughout his time 6n the Campaign, Manafort directly and indirectly communicated with Kilimnik, Deripaska, and the pro-Russian oligarchs in Ukraine. On numerous occasions, Manafort sought to secretly share internal Campaign information with Kilimnik. The Committee was unable to reliably determine why Manafort shared sensitive internal polling data or Campaign strategy with Kilimnik or with whom Kilimnik further shared that information. The Committee had limited insight into Kilimnik's communications with Manafort and into Kilimnik's communications with other individuals connected to Russian influence operations, all of whom used communications security practices. The Committee obtained some information suggesting Kilimnik may have been connected to the GRU's hack and leak operation targeting the 2016 U.S. election.

* **The Committee found that Manafort's presence on the Campaign and proximity to Trump created opportunities for Russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on, the Trump Campaign. Taken as a whole, Manafort's high-level access and willingness to share information with individuals closely affiliated with the Russian intelligence services, particularly Kilimnik and associates of Oleg Deripaska, represented a grave counterintelligence threat.**",SFepicure,,ic4w7z,g217vou

> There is no proof of wrongdoing on the tapes of Biden and Poroshenko. But Trump and his allies, as well as Kremlin-controlled media outlets, have used the tapes to foment conspiracies about Biden's dealings with Ukraine.

...

> The recordings are of Biden's dealings with Poroshenko, the former Ukrainian President, and they appear authentic. But the material reinforces Biden's claims that he promoted US interests and didn't do anything improper in Ukraine. There is no proof of wrongdoing on the tapes, and the Biden campaign maintains that these releases are blatant Russian meddling against the former vice president.

>Trump's willingness to capitalize on Russian meddling in the 2020 election is a similar tactic to the one that Trump's campaign embraced in 2016, as Trump advisers strategized around WikiLeaks disclosures that were facilitated by Russia, according to special counsel Robert Mueller.

> Four years ago, the first WikiLeaks releases arrived on the eve of the Democratic convention in July 2016, and Trump used the stolen emails to inflame divisions within the Democratic Party, tweeting, ""The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her."" Mueller's investigation later revealed that this intraparty tension was exactly what the Russians were hoping to stoke.

> * The president has tried to turn DHS, the nation’s largest law enforcement agency, into a tool used for his political benefit. He insisted on a near-total focus on issues that he said were central to his reelection — in particular building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Though he was often talked out of bad ideas at the last moment, the president would make obviously partisan requests of DHS, including when he told us to close the California-Mexico border during a March 28, 2019, Oval Office meeting — it would be better for him politically, he said, than closing long stretches of the Texas or Arizona border — or **to “dump” illegal immigrants in Democratic-leaning sanctuary cities and states to overload their authorities, as he insisted on several times**.

> * Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced, at the White House’s urging, a “zero tolerance” policy to prosecute anyone who crossed the border illegally. The agencies involved were unprepared to implement the policy, causing a disastrous backlog of detentions that ultimately left migrant parents and their children separated. Incredibly, after this ill-conceived operation was rightly halted, in the following months the president repeatedly exhorted DHS officials to restart it and to implement a more deliberate policy of **pulling migrant families apart en masse**, so that adults would be deterred from coming to the border for fear of losing their children. The president was visibly furious on multiple occasions when my boss, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, refused.

> * Top DHS officials were regularly diverted from dealing with genuine security threats by the chore of responding to these inappropriate and often absurd executive requests, at all hours of the day and night. One morning it might be a demand to shut off congressionally appropriated funds to a foreign ally that had angered him, and that evening it might be a **request to sharpen the spikes atop the border wall so they’d be more damaging to human flesh (“How much would that cost us?”)**. Meanwhile, Trump showed vanishingly little interest in subjects of vital national security interest, including cybersecurity, domestic terrorism and malicious foreign interference in U.S. affairs.

> * The president’s bungled response to the coronavirus pandemic is the ultimate example. In his cavalier disregard for the seriousness of the threat, **Trump failed to make effective use of the federal crisis response system painstakingly built after 9/11.

Without more context for why it's important to avoid, I must confess I strongly disagree with this rule. I often post responses to my own posts to add more context, and it's not to over influence the viewpoint, but rather add context which is missing when you can't say anything at all about why you selected that article to post. I don't know the way other users are using or abusing their ability to respond to their own posts, but I've always found the extra context helpful to start a conversation. 
Perhaps mods are seeing behaviour I'm not, and this rule is addressing that, but the explanation given is pretty general - ""influence"" - whilst to me, personally, the loss is significant. 

If I post a link to an article, I want to be able to link to other articles to provide more context. I get a lot of my news from paywalled sites like WaPo, and I want to be able to link to a non-paywalled article. I posted a story because I think it's relevant in some wider way, and I think that context is worth providing. There's a lot of news every day, and choosing a particular article to post is an act of curation. There is a maximum limit on the article we can submit - we should be able to say something about *why* we chose them, and to encourage a conversation. Otherwise it's just the same popular topics getting responded to over and over.  

Examples 

- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/iewpfo/tennessee_adopts_new_law_that_could_strip_some/g2jvjf3/) I just wanted to provide a local article on the topic of a national story

- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/iayhpy/why_were_planning_for_an_election_day_that_could/g1rh7kl/) I was posting a link to a supporting resource relevant to the article. 

- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/ia8tf4/trump_biden_tout_experience_in_police_chiefs/g1llapp/?context=3) the article was paywalled, but I was linking directly to the resources mentioned. 

- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/i9smf6/postal_service_warns_46_states_their_voters_could/g1h60d2/) I was putting one article in the context of another conversation already going on in this sub, and distinguishing the two. 

Without being able to post top level comments on my own submissions, I can't do any of this, and I think that's a loss. Meanwhile I think you would be hard pressed to call this undue influence over the topic of the conversation.",Ezili,,id6naf,g2jy1s7

I should not have to give advertising money with my click to a site that is known to spread propaganda just to make a logical argument against someone. I can't even respond without providing a click and a view to breitbart which is unacceptable.

From the subreddit rules on reliable sources it links out to here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources#Sources

And for Breitbart they specifically believe that it should be deprecated and it should not be used as a reference for facts due to unreliability, and that it should only be used for commentary.

Due to persistent abuse, Breitbart News is on the Wikipedia spam blacklist, and links must be whitelisted before they can be used. The site has published a number of falsehoods, conspiracy theories, and intentionally misleading stories. The 2018 RfC showed a very clear consensus that Breitbart News should be deprecated in the same way as the Daily Mail. This does not mean Breitbart News can no longer be used, but it should not be used, ever, as a reference for facts, due to its unreliability. It can still be used as a primary source when attributing opinions, viewpoints, and commentary.

Edit:

In fact, the wiki specifically says that if a site is ""mostly factual"" according to media bias fact check it's whitelisted, and below that it's blacklisted. Well breitbart is listed as mixed, with a mention of its history of fake news, propaganda spreading, and extreme bias.

There's no need to get ban-happy about people committing logical fallacies, after all no one is perfect. But something does need to be done about the more egregious examples.

Obviously ignoring these types of posters should be the gold standard, but I really like the general culture that the moderation has attempted to encourage in this subreddit.

Tu quoque is considered to be a logical fallacy, because **whether or not the original accuser is likewise guilty of an offense has no bearing on the truth value of the original accusation.**

A few thoughts.

**The nobler side of the whatabout coin is the pursuit of knowledge that can overcome bias.**

Bias can be hard to detect: You don't know what you don't know. So if an article gets posted that appears to be missing context or driven by some kind of bias, it can be absolutely worthwhile to add facts to the mix to give a broader context in hope of gaining a better understanding of the news.

On the flip side, if we decide that conversation is limited strictly to the contents of articles posted and discourage questions, we are then entirely at the mercy of which posts are submitted and upvoted. Doesn't seem ideal.

**Not everyone is engaging on a topic for the same reason, and that's okay.**

If we post a story about red apples, and I post a comment asking about how they relate to bananas, that's probably not relevant to the context of the red apple story. But if I'm doing a research project about commonalities between fruits, it's relevant to me. And since 1) this sub attracts a range of interesting people, and 2) comments are cheap, it's not inherently wrong to allow something that's not clearly a bad-faith argument.

**Whataboutism has some use in a debate context.**

There are different kinds of comments in this sub. Many are arguments or debates. In that context, asking ""what about"" can get your debate partner to rethink a position with different context, refine the argument, or can prove that your partner's argument is uncaringly hypocritical:

""President Obama sure loved budget deficits."" ""Okay, so how do you feel about [facts that prove that Republicans increase the debt too]?""

1. ""didn't know that, thanks! I'll have to rethink my position""
2. ""that is different because...""
3. ""I don't care what they did, I just don't like Obama""

**Whataboutism is probably hard to enforce**

Hard to enforce, and will cause a bunch of meta-arguments about whether something fits a rule, or gatekeeping/bias about what is actually relevant or irrelevant. I think it's fine to say ""I think that's irrelevant""/""I think it's relevant"", leave it at that, and let other readers decide.

> “Nothing will stop us from following the facts and the law, wherever they may lead. For months, the Trump Organization has made baseless claims in an effort to shield evidence from a lawful investigation into its financial dealings,” James said in a statement. “They have stalled, withheld documents, and instructed witnesses, including Eric Trump, to refuse to answer questions under oath. That’s why we’ve filed a motion to compel the Trump Organization to comply with our office’s lawful subpoenas for documents and testimony. These questions will be answered and the truth will be uncovered, because no one is above the law.”

,"I know everyone is interested in the details of this shooting, but I’m curious what the wider response is going to be to armed, unregulated militia groups at these protests.

>	“Any patriots willing to take up arms and defend our city tonight from evil thugs?”

That’s what the Kenosha Guard, a local militia, posted on their Facebook page just before this happened ([source](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/26/kenosha-militia-protest-shooting-facebook))

Will any scrutiny fall on them after this, or militia groups in general? The media had a tendency to treat white, right wing gunmen as lone wolf figures, and we don’t know if he was directly responding to that specific call, but the next logical question has to be “isn’t that incredibly irresponsible?”  A 17 year old kid went out into protests armed, untrained and unregulated, because of some notion he had that he was helping, and ended up killing two people and injuring a third.

Violence from right wing groups is a huge, growing problem ([source](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/7116354/far-right-violence-america-terrorism-threat/amp/) ) and if nothing else, I hope this helps Americans and the media start to take this threat more seriously.

If this was a Muslim kid and that same call for action had gone out from a fundamentalist Muslim group, it wouldn’t be absurd to talk about how he was radicalized online, how even if he acted alone he was clearly influenced by online sources that pushed for extreme action.

,">A sudden change in federal guidelines on coronavirus testing came this week as a result of pressure from the upper ranks of the Trump administration, a federal health official close to the process tells CNN, and a key White House coronavirus task force member was not part of the meeting when the guidelines were discussed.

Of course Fauci, the member of the task force that is the most “outspoken critic” of Trumps handling of the pandemic, was the one who was absent for these deliberations (also, I’m being generous when I say he’s an “outspoken critic”. He’s clearly maintained a very high degree of professionalism and has chosen to approach things as a “let me clarify what Trump is saying here” manner. He’s basically the voice of respectful dissent). 

With that said, I want to say that the Trump administration has brought the presidency down to an uncomfortably relatable level. 

For context: I work at a startup company that grew way too quickly for its own good, so very few people in leadership roles actually had leadership skills—they were just good at the job they held before and were promoted without further training. When I got my first leadership role at this company (and I actually have a lot of experience in management before this company, just not in the industry I’m working in), decisions were frequently made when those who were most willing to dissent from the majority were absent. I noticed this trend continue as I worked my way up and eventually became one of those dissenting voices, and the only thing that ended this trend was a new CEO who actually recognized the problem with management and brought over new dept managers from our sister company to help fix things. 

Anyway, it’s just insane to me that the state department seems to be handling a pandemic that has killed ~~millions~~ thousands and destroyed our economy in basically the same way that the start up digital marketing company I work for handles somewhat consequential management decisions.

EDIT: I used the number of cases when I was talking about deaths.",petielvrrr,,ih9mqu,g305hzq

You have a [17 year old moron kid armed with a semi-automatic rifle travelling to another state to join a militia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/us/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-video.html) who have decided to take on a police function that they have no business taking on.  They're doing this b/c they believe (probably rightfully so) that local political leadership has done an inadequate job of controlling violence in their cities.  Either it's a coincidence that most of these riots [seem to be happening in Democratic-run cities or some level of politics is in play here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/liberal-cities-radical-mayhem-11591140986).  Dems have certainly been [strangely silent](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/510217-democrats-silence-on-our-summer-of-violence-is-a-tactical-blunder)on the matter of violent protests.

Local leadership has also consistently [rejected federal assistance in controlling the violence](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/02/867565338/governors-push-back-on-trumps-threat-to-deploy-federal-troops-to-quell-unrest).  The national media seems to be pretending that [there's nothing to see here](https://www.newsweek.com/cnn-mocked-calling-kenosha-riots-fiery-mostly-peaceful-protests-1527997) and, more grossly, [using this incident as a critique of the President.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/kenosha-suspect-kyle-rittenhouse-trump-rally)  On the other side of the aisle, he's apparently Mother Theresa b/c [he scrubbed a couple walls](https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspected-teen-gunman-kyle-rittenhouse-spotted-cleaning-kenosha-graffiti-before-shooting).

Then the kid, who is clearly in over his head, gets confronted, assaulted and chased by a mob.  In response,  the kid kills two people and injures a third.  The country then retreats to our political priors and either the kids a hero or a villain, depending on which narrative it supports.  

The kid is wrong.  The mob is wrong.  The media is wrong (on both sides). The kid's parents were wrong.  Literally nothing good was going to come from letting your kid travel across state lines to join a militia.  And if you didn't know where he was, you should have.  Now two people are dead, one is injured and your kid did it.  I hate it all.",carneylansford,,ihnvuu,g31mlt1

> ""I wouldn't legitimize a conversation with him nor a debate in terms of the presidency of the United States.

>""I don't think that he should dignify that conversation with Donald Trump. You ask them any questions, both of them, just take their own stage for any number of conversations about any subjects.

Let that be a conversation with the American people, not an exercise in skullduggery.""",neuronexmachina,,ihpxh7,g31uvm7
,"This statement really irked me, and I don't think Pelosi should've gone with this *at all*. It's literally just ammunition for Trump's base, despite her *actual* quote not being what you think it is.

Here's what she said:

> ""I wouldn't legitimize a conversation with him nor a debate in terms of the presidency of the United States. Now, I know that the Biden campaign thinks in a different way about this, but I just, I thought what he did in the 2016 was disgraceful, stalking Hillary Clinton like that. I was disappointed that the press didn't say, go back to your station. You're not here, you don't own this stage. You have your own podium. She has hers. So I think that he'll probably act in a way that is beneath the dignity of the presidency. He does that every day. But I think he will also belittle what the debates are supposed to be about. And they're not to be about skullduggery on the part of somebody who has no respect for the office he holds.""

> ""I don't think that he should dignify that conversation with Donald Trump. You ask them any questions, both of them, just take their own stage for any number of conversations about any subjects. Hold them accountable. What are they proposing? What is their vision? What is their knowledge? How are they going to get it done?  How do they connect with the American people? Let that be a conversation with the American people, not an exercise in skullduggery.""

Basically, to sum that all up, she doesn't think it's worth debating Trump because he'll just lie repeatedly and there's no point. It undermines debating and we saw in 2016 how Trump acts during debates. So she thinks it's futile.

The big caveat here, is that the Biden campaign disagrees with her:

> Following Pelosi's comments, Biden and his campaign made clear that he still intends to debate Trump.

> Asked later Thursday on MSNBC if he would consider not debating Trump, Biden replied, ""No. As long as the Commission (on Presidential Debates) continues down the straight and narrow as they have, I'm going to debate him.""

Where the Biden campaign agrees is with her characterization of Trump's behavior (aka he's just gonna lie the entire time):

> Responding to Pelosi's comments, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said the campaign certainly agrees with the speaker's views of Trump's behavior.

> ""But just as she has powerfully confronted that behavior in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room, Joe Biden looks forward to doing the same on the debate stage,"" Bates said in a statement Thursday.

The thing I don't understand is the current [narrative by the Trump Campaign](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-debates/index.html) that Biden doesn't want to debate. Biden's campaign has been pretty clear on this, and the only room for misinterpretation is:

> Biden previously agreed to participate in the three announced fall debates with Trump, **while the President and his campaign have pushed for a fourth general election presidential debate.**",AFlaccoSeagulls,,ihpxh7,g32100h
,"I can't see how Biden NOT debating Trump could help Biden with fence-sitters. If you already love one candidate or hate the other enough to where your mind is made up, it really doesn't matter. But for people who haven't made up their minds, it seems like not debating could paint the picture that Biden is [scared](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-biden-debate-2020-election-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-a9482956.html"">scared), or [confused](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/05/14/sleepy-joe-biden-dazed-and-confused-when-it-comes-to-obamagate/).   


If the Democrats don't have anything to fear on that front, Biden should debate. If he gives a good accounting of himself, or makes a fool of Trump, that could only help him. I feel the Democrats are worried the debates will do more harm than good. And Trump...he's already President. He doesn't need to be ""legitimized"" by Biden ""giving him the time of day."" We know what he's about. If that's enough for a large enough chunk of fence-sitters, the incumbent (as usual) has it in the bag.",RelsircTheGrey,,ihpxh7,g344b1f

,"Right wing nutjobs are a serious problem [throughout the world](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/trump-domestic-extemism-homeland-security-401926), but particularly in the USA. The CATO institute, in their 2017 analysis, ***[Terrorism Deaths by Ideology: Is Charlottesville an Anomaly?](https://www.cato.org/blog/terrorism-deaths-ideology-charlottesville-anomaly)*** looked at 25 years of terrorism on U.S. soil, and found that Nationalist and Right Wing terrorists killed 10 times as many people as Left Wing terrorists did.


&nbsp;


The 2017 Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB; a product of the FBI and DHS), ***[White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3924852-White-Supremacist-Extremism-JIB.html)*** highlights that, 

> **White Supremacist Extremist Movement Continues to Pose Threat of Violence to US Law Enforcement**

> We assess lone actors and small cells within the white supremacist extremist (WSE) movement likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year. This assessment is based on a review of lethal and potentially lethal incidents of WSE violence from 2000 to 2016 and the often spontaneous and opportunistic nature of these acts that limits prevention by law enforcement.

...

> A review of incidents since 2000 shows racial minorities have been the primary victims of WSE lethal violence (see Figure 3). The second most common victims were other Caucasians, including the homeless, drug dealers, sex offenders, and other white supremacists perceived as disloyal to the WSE movement. Adherents of the WSE movement view these persons as legitimate targets, as they pose a threat to, or reflect poorly on, the white race. Other targets have included persons or facilities associated with government and law enforcement.

&nbsp;


Just yesterday, *[The Brennan Center For Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/)* released their report, ***[Hidden in Plain Sight: Racism, White Supremacy, and Far-Right Militancy in Law Enforcement](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/hidden-plain-sight-racism-white-supremacy-and-far-right-militancy-law)***. 

> Summary: **The government’s response to known connections of law enforcement officers to violent racist and militant groups has been strikingly insufficient.**

...

> Explicit racism in law enforcement takes many forms, from membership or affiliation with violent white supremacist or far-right militant groups, to engaging in racially discriminatory behavior toward the public or law enforcement colleagues, to making racist remarks and sharing them on social media. While it is widely acknowledged that racist officers subsist within police departments around the country, federal, state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactively identify them, report their behavior to prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they are sworn to serve.

...

> In 2017, the FBI reported that white supremacists posed a “persistent threat of lethal violence” that has produced more fatalities than any other category of domestic terrorists since 2000. Alarmingly, internal FBI policy documents have also warned agents assigned to domestic terrorism cases that the white supremacist and anti-government militia groups they investigate often have “active links” to law enforcement officials. 

...

> Obviously, only a tiny percentage of law enforcement officials are likely to be active members of white supremacist groups. But one doesn’t need access to secretive intelligence gathered in FBI terrorism investigations to find evidence of overt and explicit racism within law enforcement. Since 2000, law enforcement officials with alleged connections to white supremacist groups or far-right militant activities have been exposed in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and elsewhere. Research organizations have uncovered hundreds of federal, state, and local law enforcement officials participating in racist, nativist, and sexist social media activity, which demonstrates that overt bias is far too common. These officers’ racist activities are often known within their departments, but only result in disciplinary action or termination if they trigger public scandals.",SFepicure,,ii9z1s,g36k3of

I suppose there has been some erosion in support since then - even [Gregory Cheadle](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/look-at-my-african-american-leaves-republican-party.html) has abandoned Trump,

> One of the memorably surreal moments of the Trump era came during the 2016 campaign when Trump scanned his crowd, noticed a black face and blurted out, “Look at my African-American over here!” The combination of the singular and the possessive (“my”) made the tokenism of the gesture hilariously overt.
> 
> Yamiche Alcindor reports that Gregory Cheadle, the man Trump called out at that rally, has had enough. Cheadle, a real-estate broker who approves of Republican economic policy, is reclassifying as an independent due to what he calls Trump’s “white superiority complex,” and the failure of the party to stand up to the president’s bullying, including his offensive tweets against nonwhite Democrats in Congress.
> 
> “We just haven’t had people called the names publicly that we have had with this administration,” says Cheadle. “To stay on this ship now, as a black Republican, I couldn’t do it.”
> 
> Despite the loss of his African-American, at least some of the roughly 37 million African-Americans still support him. Trump’s campaign has positioned a man they call “Michael the Black man” behind Trump at many rallies, where he holds a sign identifying himself as a member of (shrewdly using the plural) “Blacks for Trump.” His actual name is Maurice Symonette, not Michael. Also he is [crazy](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/10/the-blacks-for-trump-guy-is-a-former-cult-member.html).
> 
> Trump has also [thanked](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/trumps-grossly-dishonest-appeal-to-african-americans.html) the African-American community for not voting.

Voting by mail makes it incredibly easy for another household member to apply for a ballot and vote for them or watch and force them to vote a certain way.  It's probably even easier in places with automatically distributed mail in ballots.

As an example, imagine a family of 4, including two children away at college.  Dad is politically interested, wife is moderately, and college kids (as is the norm) aren't interested in voting yet.  Suddenly, the father can vote for at least himself and the two kids and possibly the wife as well.  That triples or quadruples his voting power.

Is it legal? No (maybe some places?).  Is it ethical? No.  But it's easy and what kid is going to try to have their parent's prosecuted for it?",gonzoforpresident,,iiyfmg,g3b8o56

,"When you look at the data, it's clear that the USA has completely bungled their COVID-19 response so far. Let's compare the US outcome to the G7,

> [The Group of Seven (G7) is an international intergovernmental economic organization consisting of seven major developed countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, which are the largest IMF-advanced economies in the world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven) 

Big countries, advanced economies: should have a comparable ability to respond to a pandemic. Let's even add Russia to the group - [god knows DJT is keen to](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52885178). 

&nbsp;

Consider the [raw COVID-19 cases](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&casesMetric=true&interval=total&hideControls=true&smoothing=0&country=CAN~DEU~USA~RUS~FRA~ITA~JPN~GBR&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc). Currently, the USA has 6,000,000 cases, ***6 times as the next highest country***, Russia, with 990,326. And ***18 times the next highest G7 country***, the UK. 

*But, but.... different populations!*

OK, let's [normalize COVID-19 cases by population](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&country=CAN~DEU~USA~RUS~FRA~ITA~JPN~GBR&casesMetric=true&interval=total&hideControls=true&perCapita=true&smoothing=0&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc); 18/MM in the USA, 6.8/MM in Russia (nearly a third of the USA), and 4.9/MM in the UK.

> The approach’s chief proponent is Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist from Stanford’s conservative Hoover Institution, who joined the White House earlier this month as a pandemic adviser. He has advocated that the United States adopt the model Sweden has used to respond to the virus outbreak, according to these officials, which relies on lifting restrictions so the healthy can build up immunity to the disease rather than limiting social and business interactions to prevent the virus from spreading.

...

> **Atlas, who does not have a background in infectious diseases or epidemiology, has expanded his influence inside the White House by advocating policies that appeal to Trump’s desire to move past the pandemic and get the economy going**, distressing health officials on the White House coronavirus task force and throughout the administration who worry that their advice is being followed less and less.

***But... but, Sweden!***

A recent *Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine* article, *[
Four months into the COVID-19 pandemic, Sweden’s prized herd immunity is nowhere in sight

> If we now make judgements about the first four months (so not as Sweden would wish us to do), what has happened in Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries is instructive. Table 3 lists in detail the different measures taken and their timings in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway, while Figure 1a shows the ‘severity’ score for each country’s plans, as well as some of the data about the impact these measures had on the relevant populations. The inter-country disparities in cases of infection and mortality – with Sweden clearly having many more infections and fatalities (see Table 1 and Figure 1b); this is something that has seriously concerned the other members of the Scandinavian family.27 It is clear that not only are the rates of viral infection, hospitalisation and mortality (per million population) much higher than those seen in neighbouring Scandinavian countries, but also that the time-course of the epidemic in Sweden is different, with continued persistence of higher infection and mortality (as one is inexorably linked to the other) well beyond the few critical weeks period seen in Denmark, Finland and Norway, whose rapid lock-down measures seem to have been initially more successful in curtailing the infection surge.

> That said, Sheridan’s spending comparison suggest that the economic impact was only slightly reduced by not imposing a more effective compulsory lockdown. “It’s very little in economic costs for saving a larger number of lives,” he says.
> 
> What’s more, recent data released by another bank suggests that spending in Denmark has recovered faster than in Sweden, says Sheridan.
> 
> Others have claimed that Sweden suffered less of an economic decline on the basis of initial estimates of GDP for the second quarter of 2020. Sweden’s fell by 8.6 per cent, less than the estimated average of 11.9 per cent for the European Union as a whole.

> However, those making such claims fail to point out that several countries that did impose compulsory lockdowns did as well or better. GDP fell 8.4 per cent in the Czech Republic, for instance, and just 5.1 per cent in Lithuania, the lowest in the EU.",SFepicure,,ik07zh,g3hj3x3

Some things I found interesting:

- Policy differentiations: Troops seems to be harder on Russia than Trump (47% disagree with his handling of the alleged Russian bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan, 81% ranked Russia as a greater threat to the US than Iran), are concerned about white nationalism in the US (48% listed it as a national security concern), and didn't want to be involved in responding to protests in the US (74% disagreed with Trump's proposal to use active-duty military to respond to protests).
- Stated vs actual voting: 44% of respondents listed themselves as independent or voting for third party candidates (notwithstanding Liberatarians, who were lumped in with Republicans). In polling for the 2016 election, 34% percent of respondents said they planned to vote for a third party candidate, but only 5% actually did so based on exit polling. I'd assume something similar will happen this election and it'd be interesting to see where they fall.

,"You can say whatever you want about Trump and whether or not he has defended White Nationalists or violence from the right or not, but the fact remains that this man does everything he can to divide this country as much as possible instead of unite us whenever an opportunity presents itself - that is a fact and it is supported by history and the facts.

[General James Mattis said it best](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869262728/read-the-full-statement-from-jim-mattis)

> Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.

There have been so many opportunities for Trump to put his ego aside, put politics and partisanship aside and try to unite this country, but at each opportunity, he has chosen to further inflame tensions and create more divide and anger between Americans. For example, just last night, [a reporter asked if he'd condemn the murder of 2 people in Kenosha, and Trump wouldn't, and then *defended* the murderer](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/31/908137377/trump-defends-kenosha-shooting-suspect). We all know of the infamous [""very fine people"" press conference](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/15/543769884/transcript-trump-shifts-tone-again-on-white-nationalist-rally-in-charlottesville), where Trump couldn't even bring himself to coherently condemn Neo-Nazis because he *had* to say there was also ""very fine people"" within that group, and that ""the other side"" was to blame as well. I mean, after a woman was ran over by a Neo-Nazi, the guy said there was violence ""on many sides"".

Not only that, but 2 more examples, per the article OP posted:

> The president similarly defended members of a Trump-backing caravan of trucks and cars that took on protesters Saturday night in Portland, firing paintballs and other projectiles at them as they roared past. “Paint is a defensive mechanism,” Trump said. “Paint is not bullets.” 

> The president also seemed to express sympathy with police officers who kill unarmed civilians, many of them Black, in the line of duty, saying they have just a split second to make a decision and sometimes “choke.”

,"The idea that if there are contributing factors, for instance ""just because the person was obese or had diabetes or dementia""^[1](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/cdc-reduced-death-count-related-covid-19-72735707) that you can discount that death as not a COVID-19 death would be laughable if it weren't so disgusting.

Any other year and there would be no second guessing a death report for contributing factors but because this disease has become so polarized you have internet sleuths looking at the numbers and extracting the result they want with no regard for what the numbers mean.

Beyond that, the number of COVID cases is surely higher than the positive tests show, a review from influenza-like symptoms being diagnosed in March shows that as many as 80% of the cases of **symptomatic** COVID may have gone untested and undiagnosed.^[2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-millions-cases-u-s-may-have-gone-undiagnosed-march)

All this just goes to the conclusion that, when looking at year-to-year death averages, the true cost of life from COVID-related deaths could be much higher than what is actually recorded as a COVID death.^[3](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/12/us/covid-deaths-us.html)

So why the need to twist the numbers here?  Because they look really bad for a president who *did not want to take a national lead on a problem that was by definition national.*^[4](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html)

The mind-boggling part is that polling indicates that in states whose governors stepped up show a huge increase in favorability for those governors^[5](https://scri.siena.edu/2020/03/30/87-of-nyers-approve-of-cuomos-handling-of-the-coronavirus/); had Trump taken the reigns he might be a shoe-in.  But his instincts here seem to be to avoid the problem and blame others, and the number manipulation reflects that his supporters are in line with that.

,"How else would a university standardize students’ performance from various high schools and backgrounds then? This is anecdotal, but my high school was very guilty of grade inflation; we had a ton of students getting A’s and B’s in AP classes who pretty much just showed up to class and breathed. If there wasn’t an SAT score to “normalize” or measure those students against those took “regular difficulty” difficulty classes, isn’t that setting up more students to fail once they get to college? Also given admission limits, people with inflated grades might take up and “waste” a spot that could have gone to a student in a more challenging high school.

Not to mention the [ceremony Chad was involved in as part of the RNC](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2020/08/31/dhs-chief-chad-wolf-says-he-didnt-know-naturalization-ceremony-would-be-aired-at-rnc/), and the fact that he has been [illegally in the role](https://www.theusconstitution.org/blog/how-the-trump-administration-is-evading-senate-advice-and-consent/) for many months whilst the president avoids senate confirmation.

,"This seems like a new bent on our traditional (and disingenuous) ways of delegitimizing those who disagree with us on certain topics.  I've notice a marked increase, especially in the media, in the following in recent years:

1. [Faulty Generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization):  Oh, that small group on the other side of the aisle thinks something crazy? Well then, that position must be representative of EVERYONE on the other side of the aisle.  
2. Trivialization/Mischaracterization:  The most recent example I can think of was during the beginning to middle part of the lock down.  [Some small business owners were really hurting](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/06/11/small-businesses-struggle-with-the-pandemic-and-protests/) and [having a difficult times making ends mee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/small-firms-die-quietly-leaving-thousands-of-failures-uncounted)t and began a protest.  This immediately became ""[you value a haircut more than human life](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/get-psyched/202004/you-want-get-haircut-i-want-not-die-covid-19)"" to some opponents of opening up.  
3. Hypocrisy:  Want to gather in large groups at a rally or to protest the lock downs?  You're [spreading the virus](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/lockdown-protests-spread-coronavirus-cellphone-data).  Want to gather in large groups and protest police treatment of minorities?  [Nothing to see here](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/black-lives-matter-protests-didnt-contribute-to-covid19-surge).

So much for testing and tracing , I guess.  Maybe the virus evaluates the righteousness of the underlying cause of the rally and chooses not to infect the righteous.

This article seems to be an extension of the above:

1. Anyone who doesn't want to lock down forever is an anti-masker!
2. Anti-maskers are just like those QAnon nutjobs!
3. Through the transitive property (If, A=B and B=C, then A=C):  ""Anyone who doesn't want to lock down forever=QAnon"" and can therefore be dismissed out of hand!

,"Sudden death in the setting of excited delirium is not uncommon, even in the absence of aggravating factors, like being physically restrained [1]. Despite some claims about excited delirium not being a recognized medical diagnosis, it remains a well documented phenomenon and is directly associated with rhabdomylosis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, both of which are fatal conditions [2]. We can make academic arguments about what does and does not constitute excited delirium all day long, however, the fact remains that the ingestion of psychoactive substances can lead to a state of aggression, agitation, paranoia, violence, and unexplained physical strength [2]. People suffering from this condition often cannot be reasoned with and are extremely aggressive toward any attempted intervention [3]. As easy as it may be to leave these individuals to their own devices, they more often than not present a danger to themselves and the people around them and will do irreparable harm if not appropriately intervened. 

It’s also worth noting that excited delirium is not a “mental health crisis” and labeling it as such does a disservice to to anyone who actually suffers from a mental health disorder. It is a self-induced psychosis that comes as a risk of abusing psychoactive substances.

,"Okay, not gonna lie, I know nothing more about about Patriot Prayer than what I've read today, and I don't think this article explained a lot to me. This seems like a good venue to ask for more information.

>Gibson espouses non-violence but is accused by anti-fascist groups of provoking confrontations. 

This is the only thing in the article that suggests a reason to take down their content. Was that all it took, or is this a legitimately bad group? And that phrasing sounds a bit weaselly, doesn't it? Confrontations are a two-way street.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Prayer

There's a pattern in a lot of these reports: They show up, counterprotesters come, trouble ensues, people get arrested (but a lot of the reports don't actually say which side the arrests came from). Seems like it's a lot of guilt by association, since the Proud Boys and other less savory groups will show up for similar events. The paragraph from [this article](https://www.portlandmercury.com/blogtown/2019/08/26/27039560/undercover-in-patriot-prayer-insights-from-a-vancouver-democrat-whos-been-working-against-the-far-right-group-from-the-inside) seems typical of a lot of what I skimmed:

>It was a mess. Patriot Prayer was joined by three left-wing protest groups and a pack of heavily armored police officers. Police used pepper spray on several anti-fascist (commonly shortened to “antifa”) protesters, arrested 14 participants, and ended up detaining more than a hundred attendees—including several journalists—when the crowds didn’t disperse. 

In other words: counterprotestors showed up and caused trouble, so Patriot Prayer gets marked as controversial and partially responsible for shenanigans.

Anyways, apparently their leader was arrested for inciting a riot on May Day 2019; what became of it? Was he found guilty? Didn't see any followups.

If you think Patriot Prayer is a bad group and I should treat it accordingly, what's the smoking gun for you?",Brendinooo,,imsl4y,g42por4

,"Inevitably people will bemoan, ""Boo hoo, fake news - anonymous sources!""

Why might sources be afraid of Trump? Consider the final words of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman's testimony before Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/politics/vindman-statement-testimony.html) 19 November 2019,

> Dad, my sitting here today, in the US Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision forty years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.

Well, he got that part wrong, [because three months later](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/08/trump-vindman-impeachment-ukraine-forced-out-campaign-of-bullying-prompts-key-trump-impeachment-witness-to-quit-army/),


> **Trump fired Vindman from the NSC and suggested the military should take disciplinary action against him. Vindman’s** ***twin brother,*** **Yevgeny Vindman, who served as a lawyer on the NSC, was sacked and escorted out of the White House despite not being involved in the impeachment hearings**.

...

> Senior military officials made clear to Vindman that he would never get his promotion and was reportedly threatened with a “rehabilitative assignment,” such as manning a radar station in Alaska, according to CNN, which first reported Vindman’s retirement.


&nbsp;

Moreover, it's not just original reporting in *The Atlantic* - the accusations have been verified by at least three other reporters. 

The [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/b823f2c285641a4a09a96a0b195636ed),

> A senior Defense Department official with firsthand knowledge of events and a senior U.S. Marine Corps officer who was told about Trump’s comments confirmed some of the remarks to The Associated Press, including the 2018 cemetery comments.

...

> The Defense officials also confirmed to The AP reporting in The Atlantic that Trump on Memorial Day 2017 had gone with his chief of staff, John Kelly, to visit the Arlington Cemetery gravesite of Kelly’s son, Robert, who was killed in 2010 in Afghanistan, and said to Kelly: “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?”

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-said-us-soldiers-injured-and-killed-in-war-were-losers-magazine-reports/2020/09/03/6e1725cc-ee35-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html),

> A former senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, confirmed to The Washington Post that the president frequently made disparaging comments about veterans and soldiers missing in action, referring to them at times as “losers.”
> 
> In one account, the president told senior advisers that he didn’t understand why the U.S. government placed such value on finding soldiers missing in action because they had performed poorly and gotten caught and deserved what they got, according to a person familiar with the discussion.
> 
> Trump believed people who served in the Vietnam War must be “losers” because they hadn’t gotten out of it, according to a person familiar with the comments. Trump also complained bitterly to then-Chief of Staff John F. Kelly that he didn’t understand why Kelly and others in the military treated McCain, who had been imprisoned and tortured during the Vietnam War, with such reverence. “Isn’t he kind of a loser?” Trump asked, according to the person familiar with Trump’s comments.
> 
> Trump, who received a medical deferment from Vietnam over alleged bone spurs, has said as much publicly about McCain. During the 2016 presidential election, Trump derided McCain’s legacy as a war hero, saying of his years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, “I like people who weren’t captured.”

And a [Fox News](https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-correspondent-confirms-trump-said-dead-us-troops-losers-2020-9) national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin, 

> ""According to one former senior Trump administration official: 'When the President spoke about the Vietnam War, he said, 'It was a stupid war. Anyone who went was a sucker,'"" Griffin tweeted.

> This source also described ""a character flaw"" of the president, saying, ""He could not understand why someone would die for their country,"" Griffin added.

...

> Griffin said one of her sources told her the president was in a foul mood and asked why he had to visit two cemeteries during the visit.

> ""The President was not in a good mood. Macron had said something that made him mad about American reliability and the need perhaps for a European army. He questioned why he had to go to two cemeteries. 'Why do I have to do two'?""

...

> One of the sources also confirmed that the president said during a planning session that it was ""not a good look"" to include the ""wounded guys"" in a July 4 military parade


&nbsp;

Trump, of course, denies all of it. But his statements are obvious bullshit, e.g., 

[Remarks by President Trump After Air Force One Arrival | Joint Base Andrews, MD | September 3, 2020](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-air-force-one-arrival-joint-base-andrews-md-september-3-2020/),

> So I said, “No, I want to do it.” They said, “You can’t.” There was no way I would have been able to do it. And they would never have been able to get the police and everybody else in line to have a President go through a very crowded, very congested area.

> **So I went and I called home. I spoke to my wife.** I said, “I hate this. I came here to go to that ceremony,” and to the one that was the following day, which I did go to. I said, “I feel terribly.” And that was the end of it.

A fine tale, if Melania were not [with Trump in France](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/politics/trump-france-memorial-cemetery-visit-fact-check/index.html). 

&nbsp;

The backlash has already started,

> Retired Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton, a frequent Trump critic, urged Twitter followers to vote against the president, posting a [widely shared video](https://twitter.com/PaulDEaton52/status/1301694957170749441) in which he relayed a story about how his father was shot down over Vietnam. “I am stunned that anybody in the United States military would consider you anything but a loser or a sucker,” Eaton said. “You’re no patriot.”",SFepicure,,imufs1,g43aqgt

>For any employee Social Security taxes deferred from September 1 through December 31, 2020, the Treasury Notice requires the employer to withhold and pay those taxes ratably from wages paid between January 1 and April 30, 2021. Failure of an employer to withhold and pay such amounts by April 30 will result in accrual of interest, penalties and additions to tax beginning on May 1, 2021. The Treasury Notice allows, if necessary, an employer to “make arrangements to otherwise collect” the total taxes due from the employee but does not describe what form such arrangements might take.
[...]

>The deferral of withholding of Social Security taxes from eligible wages is optional for employers. Current guidance does not specifically mandate that withholding of Social Security tax must stop for the period September 1 through December 31, 2020, and Secretary Mnuchin has publicly stated that employers cannot be forced to participate in the deferral program.

>Absent further action from Congress, pursuant to the Treasury Notice, employers will remain liable for any deferred employee Social Security taxes, regardless of whether they are able to fully withhold such deferred taxes from employees from January 1, 2021 through April 30, 2021, or otherwise able to fully collect such deferred taxes from employees.

,"I was curious about the deferral since I drive truck for a living; but after reading through the actual guidelines, it's just not worth it. The temporary boost in immediate income isn't worth getting fucked with by the IRS should you owe on income tax later down the line.

Just push for a tax holiday instead. That's sorely needed.

Ex: I earned a gross income of $1,808.00 after a particularly long and hellish week.

My net income post taxes (Federal, State, insurance, etx) was $1,287.63.

In other worse almost a third of my income was taken before I'd ever seen it. My income in a week where I gross $1,500, or $1,600 comes to a net of about $1,085 or over $1,100.

So why put in the extra work for no real extra gain? That's a question you should ask the IRS.",,,in14m8,g45mku3

Law-Enforcement has a relationship with white supremacists:

The public generally [ignores crime in black neighborhoods, viewing ""black-on-black"" crime as not important](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/us/americas-overlooked-gun-violence.html).

>“Clearly, if it’s black-on-black, we don’t get the same attention because most people don’t identify with that. Most Americans are white,” said James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston. “People think, ‘That’s not my world. That’s not going to happen to me.’ ”

>Michael Nutter, a former Philadelphia mayor, who is black, said that society would not be so complacent if whites were dying from gun violence at the same rate as blacks.

>“The general view is it’s one bad black guy who has shot another bad black guy,” he said. “And so, one less person to worry about.”

This willful ignorance is a part of the white privilege that helps perpetuate the idea that police need to just police those neighborhoods more, instead of looking into the [generational trauma that has affected those communities](https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/equity/projects/infantmortality/session2.2.pdf).

Let's not waste time arguing about whether the protests are violent, but why so many people are upset enough to consider violence.

>Wasow’s study fits into a broader consensus that nonviolent protests tend to yield outcomes that achieve a movement’s goals better than violent protests do. But there is some research that pushes back on this. For instance, another recent study by political scientists Ryan Enos, Aaron Kaufman and Melissa Sands found that the 1992 Los Angeles uprising — a violent reaction to the acquittal of four police officers caught on camera beating Rodney King, a black man — didn’t spark a backlash. Instead, they found that the protests may have led to an increase in support for funding local public schools. Similarly, the Black Lives Matter protests following the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers seemed to have led to decreased racial resentment among white Americans — especially among younger people — even though there was violence associated with some of the protests.

[links in the article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-protests-can-do/)

>One important thing to remember here is that **minority-led protests historically tend to draw more of a police presence than predominantly white protests, and the police are often more likely to use force against minority-led protests.** So in many instances, the violence we may associate with these protests isn’t because these protests are inherently more violent; it’s because they draw more intense police contact to begin with. So if the research from the 1992 uprising and recent Black Lives Matter protests is any indication, it’s possible that violence in some protests may not entirely upend a movement’s goals.",roylennigan,,ink4j7,g48poui

Both Reuters and the R.N.C. declined to discuss the payment. It was labeled “legal proceedings — IP resolution,” suggesting it was related to a potential litigation over intellectual property.

Lost it's cash advantage? He won last time spending half as much. 

In 2016 his campaign spent $646.8M (About half of hillary), with more than 10% (66M) of that being his own money. 

The last ""push"" of the campaign cost 94M

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/09/trump-and-clintons-final-campaign-spending-revealed

Also how can you compare fundraising and cash advantage without giving Biden's total fundraising anywhere in the article?

,"The author does a pretty poor job of laying out the case, IMHO.  There seems to be a lot of innuendo baked into this particular cake, as well as some things that need clarifying.

To wit:

1. Was Cohen engaged in a professional capacity or was this simply a favor for a friend?  If the former, isn't this a violation of attorney/client privilege?  If the latter, this isn't illegal, but it sure doesn't make Cohen look great if he's selling his friend(s) out in order to turn a buck.
2. According to the story, Cohen told CNN “there is absolutely no connection between the photos and my personal request to the Falwells to assist the Trump campaign.”   Now he's intimating the opposite.  That means he was was either lying then or he's lying now.  Now exactly a great source.

4. It's notable that Cohen stops juuuuust short of completing the linkage between the suppression of the photos and the endorsement.  This seems to be both important and by design.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that at that time the government was still not advising people to change their daily habits to avoid the coronavirus pandemic.

Also dr fauci today.  

But Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News later: “I don’t think [Trump] ever distorted things that I spoke to him about.”

Referring to Trump’s coronavirus press briefings, Fauci said, “I don’t think he said much different than what we said [to him] when we were in the Oval Office.”

In public statements about the coronavirus pandemic, going all the way back to January, Trump took a very optimistic view — arguably, an overly optimistic one.

> Michael Caputo, a **former Trump campaign official with no medical or scientific background**, was installed in April as the health department's new spokesperson

...

> **Caputo and his team have attempted to add caveats to the CDC's findings,** including an effort to retroactively change agency reports that they said wrongly inflated the risks of Covid-19 

...
> Caputo's team also has tried to **halt the release of some CDC reports**

...

> In one clash, an aide to Caputo **berated CDC scientists for attempting to use the reports to ""hurt the President""**

He was not charged with any offenses.](https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-caputo-hhs-trump-loyalist-ukraine-roger-stone-2020-4)

* [Caputo moved to Russia in 1994 after the fall of the Soviet Union and advised Boris Yeltsin while working for the U.S. Agency for International Development.

,"It's very rare that I feel such a negative sentiment on such a broad scale, but I really feel like the whole nation of China can basically just piss off.  Who the hell do they think they are, ""warning"" us because we're in negotiations with a foreign power?  It'd be like us *warning* China because they're in talks for some kind of trade deal with Puerto Rico.

I get it, there's a lot of nuance behind it, but I'm starting to think this must be what the rest of the world thinks when they see America acting as though it can do no wrong and everyone should kowtow to us.  China has no damned right to go around ominously warning everyone and demanding apologies because we're not toeing *their* party line.

> The American ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, announced on Monday that he would step down in early October after a tenure that paralleled a sharp deterioration in relations between China and the United States.
> 
> Mr. Branstad, who twice served as governor of Iowa and was a crucial early supporter of Donald J. Trump’s presidential candidacy in 2016, arrived in Beijing in the summer of 2017 with high hopes of using a personal connection to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, to build stronger ties.
> 
> Instead, he found himself on the front lines of President Trump’s trade war and, by this year, a downward spiral of tensions that, to many, has heralded a new era of Cold War-like confrontation between the world’s two largest economies.
> 
> Mr. Branstad, who is 73, did not say why he was departing now, only months before the presidential election, but it is not unusual for political appointees to serve only a single term.

...

> He said he informed Mr. Trump of his decision last week and told the embassy staff, still depleted because of travel restrictions imposed by the pandemic, in a meeting on Monday. It was not immediately clear whether the administration would be able to move quickly enough to appoint a new ambassador before the end of the presidential term.",SFepicure,,ispld0,g59bjvv

,"Many people mocked Trump for suggesting that we should rake the forest, and blame climate change for forest fires. But actually , the new environmentalist forest policies are directly to blame for the fires: we refuse to pick up dead wood, because it creates habitats for insects and rodents or whatever, but all of this dead wood dries up and lights on fire very easily, causing uncontrollable fires. The link with global warming is a lot less obvious. Simply we cannot actually link global warming with droughts. Yes a hot surface will dry up faster ok, but in a closed system, where 2/3 of the surface is water, higher temperatures actually probably lead to more rain, though it is very complex and we are not sure. People love to blame Trump for being anti-science, but even the IPCC say that we cannot link global warming to chaotic weather or droughts.

Here is an article by Mikko Paunio which elaborates a bit on forest management.

The president has been linked with spreading conspiracy theories as well [https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-conspiracy-theories.html](https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-conspiracy-theories.html) . How are any of his statements trustworthy? I can't tell you all the amount of times people will post a trump statement and for it to be completely incorrect take, or reek of uneducated nonsensical drivel.

He was spewing lies almost every second it felt like, its ridiculous. Whenever someone posts an article on r/neturalnews should have a trump tag that is literally ""Noted liar, and/or completely false information from president and admin."" I see trump and I know he is going to lie about shit, even simple stuff. [https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) 35% of his statements have been false.

16% of his statements according to politifact are pants on fire and 20% being mostly false. in total that is around 71% mostly false statements. He is as trusting as a normal redditor (conjecture) and has had lied more than any known politician in modern American politics. This is ridiculous, this isn't normal, this isn't good.

,"The most *charitable* interpretation I can think of (and something I am sure his supporters would want to believe) is that Trump is saying this:

""Biden and the Democrats promised to fight for a national mask mandate, by convincing all the state governors to issue a mask mandate in their state. They have not done so yet, and therefore have failed America."" 

Of course even this interpretation has flaws - the Business Insider article states:

>Biden has since walked back on the idea from a federal level, citing potential constitutionality issues, and instead said he would encourage governors to do so and lead by example by wearing face coverings publicly.


And of course, there must be political challenges too - the Democrats can't convince every single governor to issue a mask mandate, especially Republican governors. At best, the Democrats can ""encourage"" governors to do so, which is something Biden has at least tweeted about. 

Ultimately it appears Trump did not want to answer the question, so he deflected and passed the ball to the Democrats, even though he is the one in power.",gulagjammin,,ituljf,g5hxjn0

,"If we're going to talk about this, that AP article links to [what should be the article we use for discussion](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-austria-forest-cities-exploding-trees-climate-change-california-oregon-wildfires-b458305.html).

[Here's another Trump sound bite with similar talking points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQs-NCN9jq8). 2:00 to the end is the relevant bit.

Regarding AP's headline,

> In reality, Austria is a country situated in the heart of Europe, where people do not live in the forest, but rather with the forest and in a close, sustainable relationship with the natural environment. Trees cover almost half of our nation’s territory.

>You will find no “forest cities” in Austria. You will find habitats closely intertwined with forests. Vienna, our capital, is surrounded by a green belt and draws a large proportion of its drinking water from the mountains and forests just an hour away.

>Yes, Austria is a forest country; yes Austrians know, love and appreciate their forests. After all, around 300,000 people in Austria make their living directly or indirectly from forestry.

Since the discussion of exploding trees is a big part of this story, [here's an article](https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/09/15/once-and-for-all-trees-do-not-explode/) that talks about it. It's not a great article, but some nuggets from it:

- The author has 33 years experience fighting wildfires and hasn't seen it
- He doesn't know a ""reputable"" firefighter that has
- John McCain alleged that trees explode in 2016
- Trump could have just watched “Red Skies of Montana” and drawn a wrong conclusion
- Some guy claims to have a photo of an exploding tree. It's...decidedly not conclusive.
- Also notes that most forests in CA are on federal land, which makes you wonder if the onus is really on CA here

Elsewhere, Wikipedia notes that trees may explode because of lightning, and supposedly eucalyptus trees can explode.

From [a report about the fire](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/09/wildfire-map-evacuations-california-oregon-washington/5755838002/):

>“Our entire community is gone,'' Brown said. ""Everyone is evacuated. We could hear the trees exploding as this red glow came up over the hillside.""

Heard, not seen. If it's a myth, maybe it propagates because of how burning/breaking trees sound?

Here's an [interesting article](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/understand-growing-wildfire-threat-look-tree-rings) from 2018:

>The single most conspicuous fact from the tree rings is that the record exists at all. In other words, the fact that trees could have survived the forest fires of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries and most of the 19th indicates a kind of fire very different from the explosive conflagrations of our times.

>Today when fires start, they no longer run along the ground and singe the trees. They roar up the “fuel ladder” of forest floor debris and thickets of smaller trunks, then explode in the crowns of trees. They jump from treetop to treetop, killing all the trees, leveling the forest, and leaving in their wake an utterly changed landscape.

""Explode"" is used in a different sense, and the article talks about how human use of the New Mexican terrain changed how forest fires affect the landscape.",Brendinooo,,iujhay,g5lge7p

Armed with his favorite question — “Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?” — McCarthy terrorized his targets and silenced his critics. Thousands of people lost their jobs as a result, often based on nothing more than innuendo or chance associations. The mob fervor extended to the state governments and the private sector, too. States enacted “loyalty oaths” requiring people employed by the government, including tenured university faculty members, to disavow “radical beliefs” or lose their jobs. Many refused and were fired. Hollywood notoriously rooted out real and suspected communists, creating the infamous “blacklist” of people who were informally barred from any work with Hollywood studios. The “red scare” even nearly toppled America’s favorite television star, Lucille Ball, who had registered to vote as a communist in the 1930s.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/15/mccarthyism-is-back-this-time-its-woke/)

In June 1870 Congress enacted a law entitled “An Act to Establish the Department of Justice.” This Act established the Attorney General as head of the Department of Justice and gave the Attorney General direction and control of U.S. Attorneys and all other counsel employed on behalf of the United States. The Act also vested in the Attorney General supervisory power over the accounts of U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals.

I think we’re probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter 2021.**

All quotations are based on the recollections of one or more individual attendees.  
>  
>Kushner, seated at the head of the conference table, in a chair taller than all the others, was quick to strike a confrontational tone. “The federal government is not going to lead this response,” he announced. “It’s up to the states to figure out what they want to do.”  
>  
>One attendee explained to Kushner that due to the finite supply of PPE, Americans were bidding against each other and driving prices up. To solve that, businesses eager to help were looking to the federal government for leadership and direction.  
>  
>“Free markets will solve this,” Kushner said dismissively. “That is not the role of government.”  
>  
>...  
>  
>According to another attendee, Kushner then began to rail against the governor: “Cuomo didn’t pound the phones hard enough to get PPE for his state…. His people are going to suffer and that’s their problem.”   
>  
>The group argued for invoking the Defense Production Act. “We were all saying, ‘Mr. Kushner, if you want to fix this problem for PPE and ventilators, there’s a path to do it, but you have to make a policy change,’” one person who attended the meeting recounted.  
>  
>In response Kushner got “very aggressive,” the attendee recalled. “He kept invoking the markets” and told the group they “only understood how entrepreneurship works, but didn’t understand how government worked.”  
>  
>Though Kushner’s arguments “made no sense,” said the attendee, there seemed to be little hope of changing his mind. “It felt like Kushner was the president. He sat in the chair and he was clearly making the decisions.”

My comment: Disregarding obvious hearsay, I always find it weird that people who come out an alleged this stuff also allege they were in the room when it happened. ""Yeah, he's nuts, he said 'XYZ.'"" And no one stopped him? ""Oh, his mind was made up.""  
You'd literally have to fire me to get me to leave after anyone said ""let's not invoke the DPA."" To go on record after the fact is worse than spineless.

,"Some additional context here:

When McConnell invoked an election year stipulation without precedent in 2016 to block Garlands confirmation vote, his reasoning did not include mention of a divided confirmation process (GOP Senate, Dem President), nor did it mention the 2014 midterm election’s flip of the senate from Democratic to GOP:

> [""We think the important principle in the middle of this presidential election, which is raging, is that American people need to weigh in and decide who's going to make this decision.""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court-vacancy-election-year-senate/)

> [""Given that we are in the midst of the presidential election process, we believe that the American people should seize the opportunity to weigh in on whom they trust to nominate the next person for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. It is today the American people, rather than a lame-duck president whose priorities and policies they just rejected in the most-recent national election, who should be afforded the opportunity to replace Justice Scalia.""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court-vacancy-election-year-senate/)


Additionally, GOP Senator Lindsey Graham even directly/explicitly stated that the same stipulation would apply in 2020, if a seat opened up:

> [""I want you to use my words against me. If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say, 'Lindsey Graham said let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court-vacancy-election-year-senate/)

Notice that Graham did not specify the division of President/Senate political party as part of the reasoning, nor did he mention the outcome of the 2014 midterm Senate flip as part of the reasoning, and directly said that the stipulation the GOP invoked/created in 2016 applies equally to this situation we’re in now.

Ignore any post-hoc justifications creating new lines of reasoning that weren’t specified in 2016 to imply that this current situation is somehow fundamentally different than the case of Garland’s nomination.",landworm,,iwh281,g625qbn
,"It is even more blatant when you look at [Lindsey Graham](https://youtu.be/Qp0_dK3mvr4)

EDIT for Rule 2:

>""I want you to use my words against me. If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say, 'Lindsey Graham said let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.""

,"The article tries to make the case that we have a divided conformation process like we had in 2016.  When the senate had a majority republican and the president was a Democrat.    By making the case that the house should count even though  they have 0 input into the nomination or conformation process. Thats the only way for their argument to work is to expand the definition and scope of the process well past reality.  

In 2016 the proccess played out as it should.  The President nominated his candidate and the senate chose not to confirm it.  Now its trumps decision if he is going to nominate and the Senate's decision whether to confrim.

,"[Here is the criteria for how cities were determined to be ""Anarchist Jurisdictions""](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-identifies-new-york-city-portland-and-seattle-jurisdictions-permitting)

I mean look at these bullet points, it's fucking insane:

> Whether a jurisdiction disempowers or defunds police departments

> Whether a jurisdiction unreasonably refuses to accept offers of law enforcement assistance from the Federal Government

> Any other related factors the Attorney General deems appropriate

How do any of these make a city ""Anarchist""? How can you reasonably tell me this isn't just an authoritarian attempt to strongman your political enemies?

Now, being a resident just outside of Portland, I want to speak on the Portland bullet points, which are:

> This month, Portland marked 100 consecutive nights of protests marred by vandalism, chaos, and even killing.

> Those bent on violence regularly started fires, threw projectiles at law enforcement officers, and destroyed property. Numerous law enforcement officers, among others, suffered injury.

> Shootings increased by more than 140% in June and July 2020 compared to the same period last year.

> In the midst of this violence, the Portland City Council cut $15 million from the police bureau, eliminating 84 positions. Crucially, the cuts included the Gun Violence Reduction Team, which investigates shootings, and several positions from the police team that responds to emergency incidents.

> In August, Portland Mayor Wheeler sent a letter to President Trump expressly rejecting the Administration’s offer of federal law enforcement to stop the violent protests.

To the first bullet point - it's worth noting that vandalism is not a serious crime, and ""chaos"" is a vague term that can mean whatever you want it to mean. Also worth noting that nobody was killed until the [Trump caravan came rolling through Portland inciting violence.](https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/09/truck-with-trump-flag-intentionally-rammed-into-woman-in-downtown-portland-45000-lawsuit-alleges.html) [source 2](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/08/30/907699226/1-killed-in-portland-amid-clashes-between-pro-trump-caravan-and-counterprotester) 

No contesting the 2nd or 3rd points, but that doesn't make a city ""anarchist"", especially when Ted Wheeler has [routinely](https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/protests/portland-mayor-ted-wheeler-discuss-protests-violence/283-a865cfe8-60ad-4628-a730-a023cc2c9d5e) called the [arrest of those doing those things](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2020/09/portland-mayor-ted-wheeler-on-city-protests-police-violence-lack-of-clarity-about-his-stance-qa.html). So again, how is this an ""anarchist jurisdiction""?

To the 4th point, it looks like the Government is going to use any defunding or shifting of resources within police departments to declare a city ""anarchist"", and that is purely ridiculous. [Portland cut 3% of the police budget](https://www.koin.com/local/portland-city-council-vote-city-budget-police-reform/), and all of those officers are being re-assigned. The money is being redirected as follows:

> The City Council plans to redirect the money toward social programs and investments in the community that help Black and other minority youth, as well as move towards a pilot program of EMTs and mental health workers to respond to 911 calls that don’t require an armed officer.

Again I ask, how is this making Portland an ""anarchist jurisdiction""?

The last bullet point is the cherry on top of everything. Trump ordered DHS to Portland [in July](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/28/896088088/trump-administration-deploys-additional-law-enforcement-to-portland), and in August, Ted Wheeler sent [a letter](https://www.portland.gov/wheeler/news/2020/8/28/mayor-wheelers-open-letter-president-trump) saying he wanted no more Federal agents in Portland because it was making matters worse: 

> When you sent the Feds to Portland last month, you made the situation far worse. Your offer to repeat that disaster is a cynical attempt to stoke fear and distract us from the real work of our city. 

He even mentions in the letter that people who violate the law will be prosecuted:

> There is no place for looting, arson, or vandalism in our city. There is no room here for racist violence or those who wish to bring their ideology of hate into our community. Those who commit criminal acts will be apprehended and prosecuted under the law. 

So again, how is this making Portland an ""anarchist jurisdiction""?

Now, finally to tie this all together to the broader point - what happened to States' rights? What happened to ""small government""? How is the Federal Government using vague declarations and completely politically-motivated language such as ""if you defund or disempower the police, we will declare you an anarchist jurisdiction and scrap federal funding from your state"" acceptable?",AFlaccoSeagulls,,ix2xbx,g64lnj3

Regardless, I think the [reasoning behind the ruling](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/election-official-warns-pennsylvania-naked-ballot-ruling-could-jeopardize-votes.html), is solid:

> Justice Max Baer wrote that based on the text of the law it was clear that the state legislature intended that “it should not be readily apparent who the elector is, with what party he or she affiliates, or for whom the elector has voted.”

> “The secrecy envelope properly unmarked and sealed ensures that result, unless it is marked with identifying information, in which case that goal is compromised,” he wrote. “Whatever the wisdom of the requirement, the command that the mail-in elector utilize the secrecy envelope and leave it unblemished by identifying information is neither ambiguous nor unreasonable.”

Apparently less than 6.5% of ballots in 2019 had that issue.  Now there is the contention that those people aren't franchised if they don't get counted, I agree it is true that people lose the franchise in this circumstance.    I would argue, however, that if a person doesn't care enough about their vote to follow directions and put their ballot in the security envelope, then they didn't care enough about their vote to have it counted.",Insaniac99,,ixtt0y,g698smh

 ""Win, lose, or draw in this election, will you commit here today for a peaceful transferral of power after the election? 


If trump wins or draws how is he supposed to commit to a peaceful transferral of power from Biden?   If biden supporters get violent after a biden loss, how does trump commiting to only take peaceful responses help those who are being hurt by the non-peaceful actions of biden suppliers?


  The question was poorly phrased and makes little sense.  Which i would guess is the reason why this article decided to partially summarize the question verus actually reporting on what was actually asked.  


  Now let see if a reporter asks Biden the same question.

,"From the article:

> The interview summary itself is a series of contradictions. Though Barnett voices deep doubts about the motivations of some of his colleagues, he ultimately agreed that Flynn lied to the FBI. He also indicated that he believed the other investigations led by the Crossfire Hurricane team were meritorious, though he says he often offered more benign theories about actions taken by Trump and his team when other agents were inclined to view them in a more incriminating light.

It just seems to be Barnett's *personal opinion* about certain things, and other agents, and the FBI itself, seemed to disagree. Barnett also said he didn't have all the facts:

> Barnett also indicated he wasn’t fully read in on all of the evidence or facts in the case and at one point sought to remove himself from it before he was convinced by colleagues like Peter Strzok, one of the lead FBI agents handling the case, to join Mueller’s investigative team.",AFlaccoSeagulls,,izktke,g6ji7id

I'm genuinely confused here:  first, why lie to save his job when lying could mean [up to five years in prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements) and, therefore, losing his job anyway?

1. But Fox News argued that Carlson ""cannot be understood to have been stating facts, but instead that he was delivering an opinion using hyperbole for effect,"" the ruling said.

2. US District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil agreed with Fox's premise, adding that the network ""persuasively argues"" that ""given Mr. Carlson's reputation, any reasonable viewer 'arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticism' about the statements he makes.""""This 'general tenor' of the show should then inform a viewer that he is not 'stating actual facts' about the topics he discusses and is instead engaging in 'exaggeration' and 'non-literal commentary,'"" the ruling said







This was the same defense used in the rachel maddow lawsuit.  Why not use a defense that is known to work?

""For her to exaggerate the facts and call OAN Russian propaganda was consistent with her tone up to that point, and the Court finds a reasonable viewer would not take the statement as factual given this context,"" Bashant added.

So, in my view, anything they air has an influence on their viewers, including Carlson and Hannity,  despite their claims. And the assumption from the article is that Fox viewers are reasonable people, yet they are in fact the Qanon and conspiracy theorists who are a danger to others, and Carlson feeds this anti-science, anti-fact group reinforcing their anti social attitudes.",S_E_P1950,,j04eqv,g6qc6fq

,"1. Note that this is an opinion piece, not a news article, and this reddit title is different from the original opinion piece article.
2. This reddit title is extremely misleading. They mention the many benefits, such as universal healthcare, then say ""The cost all this? The Denmark Big Macs cost 27 cents more."" However, as the opinion piece explicitly says, A) ""Danes pay an extra 19 cents of every dollar in taxes, compared with Americans"" and B) ""money doesn’t go as far in Denmark because prices average 18 percent higher"" as the opinion piece says. I couldn't figure out exactly how they calculated the taxes, but regardless it seems a strange way to communicate it. I don't know how much they say Americans pay in taxes, but if it was, for example, 28% on average, then paying an extra 19 cents per dollar would mean that Danes were paying 68% higher taxes than Americans. And as to Denmark prices being 18% higher on average, that implies that Big Macs costing 27 cents more is the exception, not the rule.
3. Beside my gripes about the misleading reddit title, and although I don't know how much of the original opinion piece is true, it was an interesting read, and I think that the US should continue to learn from other countries' successes and failures.
