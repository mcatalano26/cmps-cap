The 14th Amendment, Section 3 states: ""No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.

>...The question which remains unanswered, and which defenders of present U.S. policy have considered unnecessary even to address, is why there would be sufficient reason to abandon the wartime checks and balances that we ourselves, along with other Western democracies, have until now considered an essential component of the rule of law.

On the other hand, the US has had [a large standing military since World War II](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/u.s._national_defense_outlays) and the only thing approaching a Constitutional crisis since then was the [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal) and resulting resignation of President Nixon, in which the military wasn't involved at all.

Given the current role and environment in which the US military operates, is it a threat to the US Constitution? If so, how can such a threat be mitigated? If not, how do we ensure that, going forward, the US military continues to be used in a way that upholds the oaths by which uniformed personnel swear and also conforms to Madison's vision of a 'wise nation'?","The US military oaths for enlistment and for commissioned officers affirm that any and all uniformed personnel are sworn to ""support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic"".

This sentiment has recently been affirmed by two high-ranking US military personnel, former SECDEF and four star general James Mattis and the current CJCS Mark Milley:

""Of all the countries in the world, I think that we are the only one or at least one of the very few that swears an oath of allegiance to an idea that's embedded in a document called the U.S. Constitution,"" Milley said. ""We don't swear an oath of allegiance to an individual, a king, a queen, a president or anything else. We don't swear an oath of allegiance to a country, for that matter. We don't swear an oath of allegiance to a flag, a tribe, a religion or any of that [but rather to a cherished set of ideas].""

The US Constitution was written by a group now called 'the Founding Fathers', many of whom wrote profusely regarding perceived and theoretical threats to the Constitution. In Federalist #41, Madison argued that ""A standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that it may be a necessary, provision,"" and that ""A wise nation [...] does not rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety, [yet] will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties.""

For a legal opinion on the degradation of checks and balances on the military:

...The history and text of the Constitution establish a military that is controlled by both the legislative and executive branches of government as a means of preventing abuses by either.

And yet another opinion, questioning whether or not the post-9/11 military threatens general rule of law:

Three years after an attack that traumatized the nation and prompted massive military and law-enforcement counter-measures, we continue to wrestle with the central dilemma of the rule of law.

...The question which remains unanswered, and which defenders of present U.S. policy have considered unnecessary even to address, is why there would be sufficient reason to abandon the wartime checks and balances that we ourselves, along with other Western democracies, have until now considered an essential component of the rule of law.

On the other hand, the US has had a large standing military since World War II and the only thing approaching a Constitutional crisis since then was the Watergate scandal and resulting resignation of President Nixon, in which the military wasn't involved at all.

My question is:

* Is there any precedent in the United States of a sitting elected official blocking the transition process for the subsequent elected official? Has this happened at the presidential or state level?
* Realistically, what processes are in place to ensure the transition of power?
* In what ways could the President prevent the inauguration of the president-elect? For example, could the president remove secret service protection?","Despite an irrecoverable gap in enough states for an electoral victory, Donald Trump has still refused to come out and concede the election: link.

While I of course acknowledge that nothing in the US can legally stop someone from archiving someone else’s public tweets to be used against them later, I don’t know how I feel from a liberty standpoint about a politician implicitly calling for the vast archiving of speech that fits a certain criteria (pro-Trump), presumably to be used against the authors or their associates years or decades later. (Her tweet does not make clear whether she is using “Trump sycophants” to include public figures only, or rank-and-file voters as well.)

* In the European Union, how far does the “right to be forgotten” go? Specifically, if you have a right to request the deletion of data about you, does that right extend to prevention of your speech being “archived” in some way?
* What different proposals (whether legislation or something else) have been put forward to allow some type of “right to be forgotten” (e.g. in the US), and how would those proposals fit into existing law?
* Is the “right to be forgotten” in conflict with freedom of expression generally (e.g. the freedom of others to archive, index, or catalog your speech)?","There has been increasing discussion regarding a person’s “right to be forgotten”—that is, the supposed importance of certain types of information being “forgettable” so that, for example, an adult doesn’t have to worry about their off-the-cuff remarks from their teenage years coming back to unfairly ruin their reputation.

**6:30 PM EST**  Welcome to the megathread all, and buckle in for a long night.  

While we are still waiting for the first states to fully close polls, I want to ask users to refrain from calling states for particular candidates until we have calls from the major media outlets who do these forecasts.  As far as I know, the outlets doing high quality election night decision desks are: ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, the Associated Press, and Decision Desk HQ.  If you know of another you want added to this list please mention it in the comments.  Because there are likely to be significant partisan skews by vote method and what methods get tabulated first in different states, it is much more difficult this year than normal to call states, and I want to encourage everyone to be a little more patient than usual on election night.

**7:00 PM EST**  First wave of full state poll closings.  Looks like AP is calling Vermont for Biden and Kentucky for Trump.  NBC has called Indiana for Trump but not seeing that call from AP.

**7:16 PM EST JRB:3, DJT: 11** In several Florida counties (Pinellas and Hillsborough at least that I can see) Biden has already exceeded the total number of votes cast for Clinton in 2016.  Trump will need very good election day turnout to overcome these numbers.  We shall see if that happened.

**7:21 PM EST JRB: 3 DJT: 11**  [The infamous NY Times needles are back](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/forecast-president.html) but only for 3 states.

**7:23 PM EST JRB: 3, DJT: 11**  Looks like [a quite disappointing result](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1323782789934784512) for Biden in Miami-Dade county is driving the estimate that his odds of winning FL are quite slim according to the NYT.

**7:40 PM EST JRB: 16, DJT: 24** Virginia called for Biden, Kentucky and West Virginia for Trump, all expected.  Shelly Moore Capito (R) has won re-election for her WV senate seat.

**7:48 PM EST**  I found [this helpful tool showing different outlets' calls of states.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/upshot/network-race-call-tracker.html)  Given the big differences between them so far, I am not going to be putting electoral vote counts in the timed updates.

**8:15 PM EST**  Looks like Trump is extremely likely to win Florida, yet to be seen if this is something particular to FL (especially Miami) or a national trend that Trump is overperforming polls.

**8:25 PM EST**  Decision Desk HQ is the first major outlet to call a swing state, with FL being called for Trump by them.

**9:12 PM EST** Took a little dinner break there.  Trump appears to be performing pretty well in the south with the NYT projections indicating him likely to win NC and GA as well as looking like pretty much a lock for Trump to win FL.

**9:36 PM EST** Looks like some calls for Hickenlooper to unseat Gardner in the CO-Sen race, which would be the first Senate flip of the night.

**10:21 PM EST**  We are getting a lot of votes in, but with the huge differentials from different voting methods, very few race calls and not a lot definitive to say, except that we can pretty much exclude some of the Biden blowout scenarios.

**11:32 PM EST**  Fox News (but no other outlet yet) has called Arizona for Biden, which would be his first pickup.  

With that result, and with Biden trailing in GA and NC, it seems within the zone of plausibility that we could see a 269-269 tie.  That would result in invoking the contingent election process laid out in the 12th amendment.

In that case, the House would pick the President, and the Senate would pick the Vice President.  The House would however not vote like they normally do.  Instead, each state would vote as a state bloc.  And an absolute majority of states would be required to win.

**12:00 Midnight EST** OH has been called by Fox, DDHQ, and NBC for Trump and I see no reason to dispute that call.

**12:09 AM EST** Fox and DDHQ have called Texas for Trump.  All outlets have called NH for Biden.  Still unsure about the Fox call for Biden in Arizona - seems aggressive to me but we shall see.

**12:12 AM EST** The NYT needle in Georgia is now tilting slightly to Biden, and reports are that Fulton County (part of the Atlanta metro) is not going to report more results tonight and has sent their election workers home until tomorrow.  So I would expect about no chance of a GA call tonight.

Given that we will not know PA/WI/MI tonight either, I think we can fairly safely say the election result won't be known tonight.  I'll stay up til I can find someone making a formal call on the House of Representatives at least, though I've seen nothing to indicate it will not be in Democrats' hands.

**12:15 AM EST** AP has called Minnesota for Biden.

**12:27 AM EST** Fox has retracted their call for Biden in Arizona.

**12:38 AM EST**  NBC has called control of the House of Representatives for Democrats.  I don't see anyone contradicting that call, nor any evidence of a bunch of flipping seats that would lead me to question it, so I am gonna put it up top.

**12:41 AM EST**  Most outlets are calling Iowa and Florida for Trump.

**12:42 AM EST** We are not going to know the result of the election tonight.  We may not know it for a couple of days yet with certainty.  I am going to end the tick-tock here and encourage everyone to get a good night's sleep.

**12:53 AM EST**  One small update.  I was mistaken about the Fox Arizona call being retracted.  Fox has not retracted the call, and they are still saying Biden has won Arizona.","Omnes una manet nox - The same night awaits us all.

12:27 AM EST Fox has retracted their call for Biden in Arizona.

12:38 AM EST NBC has called control of the House of Representatives for Democrats. I don't see anyone contradicting that call, nor any evidence of a bunch of flipping seats that would lead me to question it, so I am gonna put it up top.

12:41 AM EST Most outlets are calling Iowa and Florida for Trump.

12:42 AM EST We are not going to know the result of the election tonight. We may not know it for a couple of days yet with certainty. I am going to end the tick-tock here and encourage everyone to get a good night's sleep.

12:53 AM EST One small update. I was mistaken about the Fox Arizona call being retracted. Fox has not retracted the call, and they are still saying Biden has won Arizona."

President Trump's new reclassification of Schedule F federal workers,1079,jk8v36,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/jk8v36/president_trumps_new_reclassification_of_schedule/,218,1604002308.0,"President Trump has issued an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/) on creating a new schedule, schedule F, that will reclassify a portion of the career federal workforce, giving agency heads the ability to hire and fire them at will under a new class in the excepted service.

The order covers ""men and women in the Federal service employed in positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.""

A long-serving federal executive and three-year Trump administration appointee, Ron Sanders, chairman of the Federal Salary Council, [is resigning from his post over the president’s recent executive order on the career workforce.](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2020/10/salary-council-appointee-resigns-calls-schedule-f-executive-order-a-red-line/)  Federal News Network cited that the order allows agency heads to hire and fire employees in Schedule F appointments at will.

The American Federation of Government Employees [called the executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/politics/trump-executive-order-federal-workers.html) the “most profound undermining of the civil service in our lifetimes,” describing it as an effort by the president to “politicize and corrupt the professional service.”

Three questions:

1. Scope. How many positions exactly may be subject to reclassification under schedule F?  What departments falls under positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character and what doesnt?

2. Powers: What powers does the new schedule give to agency heads of civil servants reclassified? The order mentions ""at will"", is it the same as the United State's ""at will"" employment laws, or is it just the same in name only?

3. Legal: Given that the administration is getting sued, how legal is the order, and how true is the NTEU's lawsuit wordings about the order?","President Trump has issued an Executive Order on creating a new schedule, schedule F, that will reclassify a portion of the career federal workforce, giving agency heads the ability to hire and fire them at will under a new class in the excepted service.

Each top level comment will contain a significant factual claim from one of the candidates. In addition, the mods will try to provide more context where necessary.

Moderators will be transcribing live, so we ask for patience as we will do our best to capture as many substantial, relevant and verifiable claims as we can. AutoMod will remove all top level comments not by mods.

***USER REPLIES TO TOP LEVEL COMMENTS***

Users (you) can reply to the stated claims by laying out the related facts and [linking to qualified sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources), but **we discourage those replies from judging the veracity of the claim**. Leave that determination to the readers.

So, instead of stating whether a claim is ""true"" or ""false,"" a good a second level response would be something like, ""Candidate A seems to be referring to this study [source], which has been called into question by some experts [source].""

*Second level comments without links will be summarily removed.*

Texas, a federal appeals court ruled that the removal of the individual mandate did not render the entire ACA unconstitutional because that portion is ""severable"" from the rest of the Act. However, the Supreme Court is scheduled to review the case during their 2020-2021 term, with oral arguments scheduled for November 10. This means that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who has criticized a previous Supreme Court decision upholding the ACA, would be among the Justices ruling on California v. Texas if she is soon confirmed by the Senate - thus her nomination has brought this court case to the foreground four weeks before arguments and three weeks before Election Day.

What are the stakes in this case? If the Supreme Court rules the entire ACA unconstitutional, what current regulations in the US health insurance system will revert to the status quo ante bellum of 2009, and what effect have they had over the past decade?"

So, instead of stating whether a claim is ""true"" or ""false,"" a good a second level response would be something like, ""Candidate A seems to be referring to this study [source], which has been called into question by some experts [source].""

What happens in the presidential election if both major parties' candidates pass away or become incapacitated?,740,j4h2un,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j4h2un/what_happens_in_the_presidential_election_if_both/,238,1601768284.0,"[So Trump has tested positive for COVID-19](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/02/trump-melania-test-positive-coronavirus/5891100002/).

Biden could very well not have it, but he may. The chance is still very small, but there's now the possibility of them *both* passing away before the election has increased quite a bit.

So what are the likely changes in the election as a result of both major candidates passing away / being incapacitated?

I see some possibilities:

- The parties could have snap primaries to determine their candidates
- The parties could select the second-place winner of their primary
- The DNC & RNC could just pick new candidates as they see fit
- The parties could just run the Vice Presidential candidates as Presidential ones
- The election could be delayed (especially since it's this close to voting day, I imagine lots of voting materials & machines have been made with these candidates)
- Some combination of the above

Which of these are possible / likely? Are there any rules governing this situation, or would it be a real fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants thing?

Is there any precedence for this happening in prior elections?","So Trump has tested positive for COVID-19.

How have diagnosed illnesses of elected US federal officials historically affected their favorability or election results?,535,j3x4mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/j3x4mc/how_have_diagnosed_illnesses_of_elected_us/,100,1601683003.0,"Last night, the president of the United States tweeted that [they had tested positive for COVID-19](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-trump-idUSKBN26N0K4) during the current pandemic, just about one month before the next US General Election for this and other federal elected positions.

A prior president who became ill at the time of a pandemic was Woodrow Wilson who [became ill in 1918 at the time of Spanish Flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson) while in the middle of a 4 year term, became incapacitated by late 1919, and then in 1920 became unable to secure even a preliminary formal nomination [in their political party's Primary Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Democratic_National_Convention) before a General Election between the different parties.

The timing and severity of illnesses between the two presidents, given the limited information we have about the current presidential illness, appear to be vastly different at the present time.  Also, historical information I could find about Wilson's favorability appears limited [scholar survey results from 1948](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#Scholar_survey_results).

Here are my discussion questions regarding elected US federal officials, especially presidents:

* What is the evidence of a tipping point for illness severity resulting in decreased voter support at the ballot box?
* Has there been evidence of a tipping point for illness severity yielding increased favorability (e.g. sympathy vote)?
* With those tipping points in mind, historically how have diagnosis of illnesses of officials affected their favorability?
* Has another official ever become ill from something, and their related stated policy positions were more lenient on means of illness mitigation compared to the other political parties' positions?  If so, how has this affected favorability or voting?","Last night, the president of the United States tweeted that they had tested positive for COVID-19 during the current pandemic, just about one month before the next US General Election for this and other federal elected positions.

The plan includes a number of common administrative steps like raising fuel standards, encouraging energy efficiency, and spending money on infrastructure, as well as more novel ideas including plans to encourage innovation in clean energy technologies through the creation of an ARPA style agency focused on climate change sources.

One notable proposal is the following:

> Establish an enforcement mechanism to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050, including a target no later than the end of President Biden’s first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line. This enforcement mechanism will be based on the principles that polluters must bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting and that our economy must achieve ambitious reductions in emissions economy-wide instead of having just a few sectors carry the burden of change. The enforcement mechanism will achieve clear, legally-binding emissions reductions with environmental integrity.

As in 2016, the moderation team has decided to post a live fact-checking megathread for at least the first 2020 Presidential debate. After which, we will discuss how it went and reassess its usefulness. 

The way it will work is as follows:

* All top level comments will be posted by mods. **Automod will remove all top level comments not by mods**

Top level comments will contain a quote from one or both candidates transcribed by one of us while watching the debate. Obviously this will be live so there may be errors. But to avoid duplications, this will be done only by the mod team.

As in 2016, the moderation team has decided to post a live fact-checking megathread for at least the first 2020 Presidential debate. After which, we will discuss how it went and reassess its usefulness.

The way it will work is as follows:

All top level comments will be posted by mods. Automod will remove all top level comments not by mods

Top level comments will contain a quote from one or both candidates transcribed by one of us while watching the debate. Obviously this will be live so there may be errors. But to avoid duplications, this will be done only by the mod team.

Ginsburg was a [generally liberal vote](https://www.axios.com/supreme-court-justices-ideology-52ed3cad-fcff-4467-a336-8bec2e6e36d4.html) on the court, and had a long career before joining the bench as a [pioneering advocate for women's rights.](https://www.aclu.org/other/tribute-legacy-ruth-bader-ginsburg-and-wrp-staff)

Ultimately, Garland's nomination was not considered and after President Trump was elected, it was withdrawn and [Neil Gorsuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch_Supreme_Court_nomination) was nominated and ultimately filled the seat previously held by Justice Scalia.

Ed Markey](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/517191-dem-senator-calls-for-eliminating-filibuster-expanding-supreme-court-if-gop) have called for Congress to expand the court if they gain power in the 2020 elections to counteract the move.

So my questions are:

1.  What are the precedents for filling a vacancy so close to an election?  Besides the notable Garland precedent, are there any others?

2. What incentives do Republicans in tough re-election fights have prior to the election, or during the [lame duck](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/lame_duck_session.htm) period?

3.  Has any lame duck Congress moved on something as controversial/high profile as this after a change in party power?

4. If Ginsburg is replaced prior to Jan 2021, and Democrats win power in the election, what are their incentives as far as possible responses?  Is there a history of court packing threats being effective?

"Why were Howard, Gallaudet, and other HBCUs given specific funding in the COVID-19 Stimulus Bill?",185,ivap3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/ivap3y/why_were_howard_gallaudet_and_other_hbcus_given/,66,1600479511.0,"This was something that blew up temporarily in late March. At the time, it was a hot issue and I'm hoping that 6 months of distance can provide an answer. 

When the Coronavirus Relief Bill was passed, Representative Matt Gaetz tweeted out that Howard University was singled out to receive funding in the bill. There was an uproar in response to Gaetz's tweet, with many people on Reddit and other social media questioning Gaetz's motives in singling out Howard. It is true that Gallaudet also received specific funding from the bill and Gaetz did not immediately identify that school.

Here is Gaetz's initial tweet: [https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1242887266718097410](https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1242887266718097410)

See page 768 for the mention of specific funding directed to Howard University, 767 for specific funding directed to Gallaudet, and page 331 for specific mention of loan deferments to HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities).

Many of the criticisms of Gaetz's tweet replied that Howard University was the home of Howard University Hospital, a COVID response center for D.C. Here is one example: [https://twitter.com/BenJealous/status/1243050384479924224](https://twitter.com/BenJealous/status/1243050384479924224)

However, Howard University Hospital has been managed by Adventist Healthcare since February [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/adventist-signs-deal-to-take-over-management-of-howard-university-hospital/2020/02/06/06e26ec8-4928-11ea-bdbf-1dfb23249293\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/adventist-signs-deal-to-take-over-management-of-howard-university-hospital/2020/02/06/06e26ec8-4928-11ea-bdbf-1dfb23249293_story.html) 

The bill's language also makes no reference to the money being related to the hospital but rather to 

>prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, including to help defray the expenses directly caused by coronavirus and to enable grants to students for expenses directly related to 3 coronavirus and the disruption of university operations.

I can't see what connection any of that has to the hospital. Similarly, Gallaudet has no major hospital service.

Other commenters and articles noted that Howard and Gallaudet were unique in that they were chartered directly by Congress and therefore do not receive federal funds in the same way.

Cross-deputized means that police can cross jurisdictions, or in this context the arrests that they make are formally subject to not just state/local laws but also federal law.

This is meaningful because...

So the cross-deputization of OSP troopers can allow state police to bypass the local District Attorney's Office entirely when it comes to charges against arrested protesters.  In fact, **arrests made by OSP troopers assigned to Portland are now being reviewed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for potential federal prosecution.** (Source #2)

(Source #2)

My questions for the sub:

* What is the prior precedent/occurrences of the US federal government charging or review previously arrested people with crimes that a state/local government attorney has expressed they will not prosecute?
* Can the US government's means of cross-deputizing and prosecution be used in a way that violates state sovereignty as defined in the constitution, notably [the 10th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)?

>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

* Were any comparable cross-deputizing actions taken during any prior wars, such as the Civil War?
* Aside from the actions explained here or the Insurrection Act, are there any other laws or charges that federal government could leverage if they wanted to compel a local prosecutor or governor to take further action in increasing law enforcement efforts or prosecuting citizens?
* Aside from a lawsuit on 10th amendment grounds, are there other remedies that local prosecutors/governors/officials have that can stop the federal government from either compelling them to take action OR circumventing local intent to not take certain actions (prosecution, enforcement, etc)?","Oregon State Police (OSP) troopers assigned to help the Portland Police Bureau with its response to the city's nightly protests have been cross-deputized by the federal government.

Nonetheless, as with our previous periods of high growth, there's a contingent of users who complain the rules are too burdensome. Rather than rehash those issues, we'll just refer anyone who is curious to the set of principles we laid out and recommitted to four years ago.

Feedback is still welcome and encouraged, though. Use the comments to provide your suggestions.

Additionally, it's been a little over a month since the relaunch of r/NeutralNews, which has been growing steadily as well. If you're looking for news subreddit, please check it out.

-Does the executive branch have the power to order government agencies to stop collecting taxes or payments? 

-In the case of these EOs, does the executive branch have the ability to mandate that the states pick up the tab for part of it? If so, do mechanisms exist that allow States to avoid such a mandate?

-Do these EOs have any relation to natural disaster appropriations? If so, what is the nature of that relationship?

What are the main differences between HEROES and HEALS? Who are the different leaders or factions who support one side or the other? And how does the US Congress's pandemic relief strategy compare with those adopted by other countries?"

>During the 1970s the Port of Oakland initiated plans to dredge the harbor in anticipation of the new, larger classes of container ships then coming into service. The plan, however, had to be approved by a host of governmental agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the EPA, and their counterparts in the State of California. A succession of alternative plans for disposing of toxic materials dredged from the harbor was challenged in the courts, and each successive plan entailed prolonged delays and higher costs. The reaction of the EPA to these lawsuits was to retreat into a defensive crouch and go passive. The final plan to proceed with the dredging was not forthcoming until 1994, at an ultimate cost many times the original estimates.","In an article entitled The Decay of American Political Institutions, Francis Fukuyama argues that the United States is undergoing a period of political decay.

A requirement for federal officers to verbally identify themselves before using force was subsequently included in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which was passed by the House but not expected to have any chance with the Senate or presidential veto.

So in the absence of such a reform, what is the current status of these federal police? What authority and constraints do they have when operating outside federal property, such as the streets of Portland? To arrest suspects, must they have probable cause for a federal crime rather than a state or municipal one, and if so are there any common infractions at protests that aren't covered by federal statutes? When federal and local police arrive at the same protest, how do they resolve jurisdiction? If civilians fail to recognize their police authority because they have no identifying marks (several different vigilantes have been caught impersonating police at recent protests), does that uncertainty mitigate potential charges for interfering with law-enforcement actions or resisting arrest? And if local governments object to the presence or behavior of federal police, do they have any means to expel them?"

Policy Successes of Black Lives Matter Organization,308,h9uvui,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/h9uvui/policy_successes_of_black_lives_matter/,45,1592304189.0,"**EDIT:** While I appreciate all of your answers to this question, I see now I was not clear in my distinction between the Black Lives Matter movement, and Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., whose website I linked. In my questions below, and in my title of this post, when I reference the ""Black Lives Matter organization"" (which I admit is a misnomer, though I'll leave the questions unedited for transparency), I mean specifically Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., and I'm curious about what they've accomplished with respect to policy. I take full responsibility for the confusion, and I apologize.

In the wake of [George Floyd's death](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/30/video-timeline-george-floyd-death/), the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" has been a part of [celebrity social media posts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/06/11/celebrities-black-lives-matter-movement/), [official corporate communications](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/13/after-years-marginalizing-black-employees-customers-corporate-america-says-black-lives-matter/), and [art on the streets of a few US cities](https://dcist.com/story/20/06/12/the-standoff-over-d-c-s-black-lives-matter-mural-illustrated/).

Likewise, donations to groups that focus on combating issues around racial prejudice and race-based inequities have reportedly skyrocketed. Specifically, according to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/14/us/politics/black-lives-matter-racism-donations.html) in the New York Times: 

> ""ActBlue, the leading site to process online donations for Democratic

> ever came consecutively this month as it processed more than $250
> million to various progressive causes and candidates in two-plus

That being said, some organizations are more forthcoming about what their funds are responsible for than others. For example, [the NAACP's organizational history page](https://www.naacp.org/nations-premier-civil-rights-organization/) describes their involvement in the processes of the ""integration of the armed forces in 1948 but also passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.""

The Black Lives Matter website, however, gives far less information than those of comparable organizations. The group's pages within their ""About"" section dedicated to their history as an organization (namely the ""[About Black Lives Matter,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/)"" ""[6 Years Strong,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/six-years-strong/)"" and ""[Herstory,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/)"" pages) all mention the group's formation in 2013-2014, but they don't mention any other significant dates important to the group, or policy successes that the group was responsible for. The only place on the website which does list significant dates and initiatives seems to be the site's [Global Actions page](https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/), which as of posting has not been updated beyond February 2019 (here is a link to the Wayback Machine's [snapshot of this page c.

This leads me to wonder:

1) Has the Black Lives Matter organization been responsible for changes in policy at the local, state, or federal level in pursuance of their mission?

2 ) If so, what are those changes, and is there any evidence that they have successfully brought the locality, state, or country wherein they were enacted closer to the organization's vision?","EDIT: While I appreciate all of your answers to this question, I see now I was not clear in my distinction between the Black Lives Matter movement, and Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., whose website I linked.

> Frontier asked approval to suspend service to 33 U.S. locations... ...the department approved just three requests...

With a 95% drop in customer demand, airlines are seeking to cut these routes anyway, and are now petitioning the US Treasury to temporarily suspend certain routes:

JetBlue wants to halt flights to 16 U.S. airports...

Delta wants to suspend flights to nine airports...

Spirit Airlines Inc asked the department for approval to suspend flights to [seven locations]....

Many of these petitions have been denied, but some have been granted:

Earlier this month, the department rejected most of Spirit's requests to halt flights...

The department earlier also required JetBlue to keep flying to nine destinations...

Frontier asked approval to suspend service to 33 U.S. locations... ...the department approved just three requests...

The department also said it had approved Cape Air's request to halt flights to New York...

Airlines have said that they would like to scale up with customer demand, instead of being forced to fly routes with few flyers:

JetBlue said it ""fully intends to gradually resume service to the levels prescribed (by the Transportation Department) at each of these airports as soon as it is both safe to do so and when even the slightest customer demand re-emerges."""

could put your station’s license in jeopardy. Cosmopolitan Broadcasting Corporation v. FCC, 581 F.2d

to it in law and in equity; we will not stand idly by and allow you to broadcast false, deceptive, and
misleading information concerning President’s Trump’s healthcare positions without consequence.

Westinghouse Radio Stations, 186 F.2d 1, 6 (3d Cir. 1950). In addition, your station has a responsibility to “protect the public from false, misleading or deceptive advertising,” Licensee Responsibility With Respect to the Broadcast of False, Misleading or Deceptive Advertising, 74 F.C.C.2d 623 (1961), and your failure to remove this deceptive ad may be “probative of an underlying abdication of licensee responsibility” that could put your station’s license in jeopardy. Cosmopolitan Broadcasting Corporation v. FCC, 581 F.2d 917, 927 (1978).

The letter concludes by saying:

Given the foregoing, should you fail to immediately cease broadcasting PUSA’s ad “Exponential Threat”, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. will have no choice but to pursue all legal remedies available to it in law and in equity; we will not stand idly by and allow you to broadcast false, deceptive, and misleading information concerning President’s Trump’s healthcare positions without consequence.

Bloomberg News has run an article on this letter titled ""Trump Campaign’s Threat on TV Licenses May Be Mostly Bluster"", in which it states:

The FCC doesn’t appear to have grounds to act against the stations for airing contentious ads, said Jack Goodman, a Washington broadcast attorney, said in an interview. The ad “is core political speech” protected by First Amendment guarantees of free speech, Goodman said.

The article also quotes Gene Policinski, senior fellow for the First Amendment at the Freedom Forum Institute, who said:

“This goes back to Nixon in the ‘60s, talking about revoking stations critical to his administration.”

Given that the Trump Campaign seems convinced that stations airing this ad, which the letter states is misleading, can be subjected to legal action, with legal precedents being cited in support of their argument, despite the content of the advert being protected under the 1st Amendment, my question is as follows: Can the Trump Campaign actually stop this advert from being aired?

Thank you."

Asymptomatic infection is considered relatively rare and early data suggests that asymptomatic viral shedding [does not appear to be a driver of infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Most symptoms are generally mild and begin gradually but include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. 

Currently the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) or R0 (pronounced R-naught or R-zero) is estimated to be anywhere from [2.0](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) to [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). The R0, which is not a fixed value, is thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. For context, the R0 for the seasonal flu is estimated at [1.28](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480) while the 2009 H1N1 Influenza outbreak R0 was at 1.46 and 1.48.  While most cases are mild, [early reports from China](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032) indicated that 16% of COVID-19 cases were severe and as of March 11th COVID-19 mortality rates are 3.4% globally.

It's worth noting that early data is often [incomplete and can be misleading](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/), with [many experts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mortality/why-covid-19-death-rates-are-not-what-they-seem-idUSKBN20Z281) expressing [caution over](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/early-mortality-rates-covid-19-misleading-experts/story?id=69477312) over early reported data.

What is COVID-19 and what symptoms does it cause?

COVID-19 is a viral infection caused by a member of a family of large viruses known as coronavirus. Originally isolated to Wuhan,China, the illness has now been reported in 118 countries across all major continents.

Today, 14 states as well as American Samoa^1 will be voting in primary elections to allocate delegates to the Democratic National Convention.^2

* **How are the delegates are awarded?**

 The key number to keep in mind when looking at results is **15%.**  If a candidate is [above 15%](https://www.270towin.com/content/thresholds-for-delegate-allocation-2020-democratic-primary-and-caucus) in a state or congressional district, the candidate gets delegates proportional to their vote.  If you're below 15%, [you get nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ)

 States award generally 1/3 of delegates statewide, and the other 2/3 by congressional district, with more delegates allocated to districts [that have voted more democratic in past Presidential elections.](https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D-Alloc.phtml)^3  So if a candidate is just below the 15% bubble statewide, they still might get a few delegates from individual congressional districts where they broke 15%.  

* **How many delegates are at stake tonight?**

 [There are 1357 delegates up for grabs,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/us/politics/2020-super-tuesday-states.html) out of a total of [3979 total.](https://www.270towin.com/2020-democratic-nomination)  1991 delegates are needed to win the nomination.  

 Today is a much bigger delegate haul up for grabs than in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#March_1,_2016:_Super_Tuesday) largely because California moved its primary to today.  As both the most populous state and a Democratic stronghold, it has huge delegate numbers, 415, accounting for more than 1/10 of the entire number of delegates available.

* **When will we know results?**

 It will vary, with the first polls closing at [7PM ET in Virginia, and the last polls closing at 11PM ET in California.](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/3/21161503/super-tuesday-voting-polls-results-what-time)

 However, some results may take quite a while.  California especially is both the biggest haul today, and [famously slow](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/809941998/on-super-tuesday-dont-expect-quick-election-results-from-the-west) in counting ballots.  Because California encourages a lot of mail voting, and counts ballots mailed on election day, they won't have all the ballots in today, and will need to process a lot of envelopes.

* **Who is gonna win?**

 Who do I look like, Nate Silver?

I'll add updates as the night goes on, but first I shall engage in my election night tradition: sushi.

Before results come in, feel free to ask any questions you think I can address above, or answer my question:

Besides voting, what election day traditions or habits do you have?

**7:00PM ET** First polls have closed, and networks are calling Virginia for Biden and Vermont for Sanders at poll closing.

**7:07PM ET** Looks like the VA call is based on Biden doing _very_ well in the exit poll, which [has him around 50% to Bernie's 25%,](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/virginia-results?icid=election_nav) with all other candidates apparently below the viability threshold.  If that held (very big if) it would mean about 66 delegates to Biden, 33 to Bernie, 0 to anyone else. 

**7:30PM ET** Polls have closed in North Carolina, and networks are calling it for Biden at polls close based on the exit poll.

**7:37PM ET** American Samoa has reported [the results](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/american-samoa-results?icid=election_nav) of its caucus, which looks like it will give Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard their first delegates of the process.  Looks like it'll be 4 delegates for Bloomberg on 175 votes and, 2 for Gabbard on 103 votes.

**7:58PM ET** Looks like Biden will break the 15% threshold in Vermont, so he will get some delegates there.  In 2016 Sanders managed to keep Clinton below that threshold and got all of Vermont's delegates that year.

**8:00PM ET**  Alabama called for Biden at polls closed, no calls in other states closing at 8pm.

**8:10PM ET** Looks like a genuine three way contest for first in MA based on exit polls among Warren, Sanders, and Biden. 

**8:23PM ET** Seeing some results in TX showing a close race, but I think that's early vote, so it might move a lot as we get today's vote in if trends in late deciders from VA/NC/AL hold into TX.

**8:26PM ET** For those who are election turbonerds like me, the DecisionDeskHQ people use some different methods from most of the networks to get results numbers, and are usually a good bit faster at reporting.  So if you're the kinda person who need their results now, it may be worth dealing with their signup.

**8:30PM ET** Arkansas polls closed, no call at polls close.

**8:37PM ET**  Looks like outside of MA, Warren is struggling to hit the 15% threshold in many states, so she'll probably be looking at a quite small delegate haul out of tonight, unless she does surprisingly well in CA.  She might get a few congressional district delegates still in other states, or results may change, but being below 15% statewide is a big loss in delegate terms.

Bloomberg is also shy of the mark in a few states so far.  Looks like he'll miss in VA, VT, and MA.  So far looks like he'll make it in states that have closed so far, but if that's early vote reports, he might fall on election day totals.

**8:47PM ET** With about 90% of results in from Virginia, NYT is allocating about 67 delegates to Biden, 31 delegates to Sanders, 1 to Warren.

**9:00PM ET** Texas, Minnesota, and Colorado polls close.  No calls at closing.

**9:03PM ET** Biden is expanding his lead in NC as same day vote comes in, with Bloomberg falling and possibly on track to end up below the threshold.

**9:11PM ET** Looks like networks are calling TN for Biden.  Seems that Biden, Sanders, and Bloomberg will all make the threshold there.

**9:17PM ET** More calls: OK for Biden, CO for Sanders.

**9:31PM ET**  MA is looking likely Biden, Sanders 2nd, Warren actually close to the threshold in her home state.  Fairly disastrous for Warren.

**9:37PM ET** Gonna take a moment to recognize the recently departed-from-the-race Amy Klobuchar for [the best walk on music of the campaign.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhX06ovfnas)

**9:42PM ET**  As I said above, the 15% threshold matters a ton.  Looking at who's currently on track to make/miss it, with the proviso that this could change (and using DDHQ numbers)

* Biden: Gonna make it everywhere
* Sanders: In some danger of missing it in AL, but safe everywhere else.
* Bloomberg: Won't make it in VT or VA.  Very likely won't make it in ME, MA, AL or MN. more likely than not to miss it it in OK and TN.  In danger if late returns are bad for him in TN and TX.  Likely safe in AR.  Certain to make it in CO.
* Warren: Won't make it in most states.  Has a good shot of making it in ME, MN, and CO.  Almost certain to make it in MA.

None of these include California because polls are still open there.

**9:50PM ET**  NBC News reports that Bloomberg will [""reassess""](https://twitter.com/JesseRodriguez/status/1235028685717045248) his campaign tomorrow.

**9:56PM ET** Some, but not all, networks calling AR and MN for Biden.

**10:11PM ET**  Polls closed in Utah at 10PM.  Sanders holds a susbtantial lead there in early returns.

**10:14PM ET**  Update on who's hitting the 15% threshold.  Sanders looks safer to make it in Alabama, meaning he would get at least some delegates everywhere.  Bloomberg has fallen below threshold in Oklahoma and North Carolina, still teetering above it in Tennessee.

**10:31PM ET** DDHQ (but nobody else I can see) is calling MA for Biden.  If that holds, that's an extremely good sign for him.  This is really about as good of a Super Tuesday as Biden could have asked for so far.  Though California is still not even polls closed, and that is the big prize of the night.

**10:35PM ET** Utah has been called for Sanders.

**10:52PM ET** Reports are that in many precincts in California and Texas, long lines are going to delay vote results, and of course those lines reflect a substantial failure of election officials to do their job and operate an efficient election.

**11:00PM ET** Polls are now closed in California, though many voters remain in line.  If you are in line to vote, stay in line and you will be able to vote.

**11:03PM ET** AP is calling California for Sanders at polls close.  I find that a bit surprising, but I assume they have some good reasons for doing so.

**11:04PM ET** Other networks are not calling California.  I am really surprised by the AP call on zero results, especially in a heavily mail-vote state which is infamously slow to count.  I think Sanders is more likely than not to win CA (it's a strong state for him generally, and heavy early vote helps him).  But with the big late movement to Biden I'd want to get some real votes in to make that call.

**11:09PM ET** OK, I assume AP is making the call based on the exit poll, which as of 6:30PM ET had [Bernie around 38 and Biden around 23.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/california-results?icid=election_nav)  That's aggressive, but if it represents same day voters even close to accurately, I can see being comfortable with the call.  But I'd still hold off on a call.

**11:19PM ET** Gonna make a threshold chart to show where candidates are making/missing it.  

Legend:  Bold is made the threshold.  Italic is missed the threshold.  Standard is uncertain.

* Biden: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**

* Sanders: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN,** AL, **AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**

* Bloomberg: *ME, VT, MA, VA, NC,* **TN,** *AL,* AR, *OK,* TX, **CO, UT,** *MN,* CA

* Warren: ME, *VT,* **MA,** *VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX,* **CO, UT,** MN, *CA*

**11:32PM ET** It looks like Texas will be very close between Biden and Sanders.  Given proportional allocation, it actually doesn't matter that much who ekes out a win if they're within a point of each other, though it may matter for narrative.  Much bigger is the question of whether Mike Bloomberg holds on to enough vote to crack 15% and swipe a share of delegates.  Currently he is at 18.19% which might hold him through what's been a consistent drop in day-of results for him today, but maybe not.  With it now looking like Biden would have the only path to the nomination with a majority of pledged delegates, whether Bloomberg hits the threshold in Texas could actually make a big difference.  It's probably worth on the order or 25 or so delegates.

**11:55PM ET** Based on early returns not being strong for her in CA, plus her weak performance nationwide in same day vote, I am going to project that Warren does *not* make the threshold in California.  That's a significant boost to Sanders, as it probably means he's consolidated more of the left-wing vote there, and means he has to share fewer delegates out of the only state tonight where he's still got a shot at earning big delegate haul.

**12:02AM ET** With 100% reporting in TN, I can say Mike Bloomberg has made the threshold there.  NYT projects 34 Biden delegates,  21 Sanders, 9 Bloomberg out of TN.

**12:09AM ET** With over 90% reporting in Utah and Colorado (per DDHQ) I am comfortable calling that Warren _will_ make the threshold in those states.  That will cut down the haul Sanders gets out of them, though if Warren eventually drops out and supports Sanders, he would benefit on net from this outcome.  (That is a big ""if"").

**12:17AM ET** Biden is now on track to win Texas, and probably by a few points.  The delegate math is hard to pencil out because Bloomberg is still dropping on same day results, and flirting with the 15% threshold.  My best guess is Biden nets ~12 delegates if Bloomberg makes the threshold, and nets ~20 delegates if Bloomberg misses it.  Perhaps more importantly, Biden probably gets 20 more delegates in absolute terms if Bloomberg misses the threshold than if he makes it, which helps his prospects for a first ballot win.

**12:28AM ET** I am gonna call the liveblog here because I like sleep.  Overall, this is about as good a Super Tuesday for Biden as he could have asked for.  Sanders is in contention but in trouble.  Warren and Bloomberg do not seem to have any viable path to the nomination.

^1 American Samoa had a caucus.

^2 There is also a Republican primary today, but it is not seriously contested.

^3 If they didn't do this, then you'd see districts which are heavily republican get far more delegates per democratic primary voter than heavily democratic districts.","Welcome to the biggest night of the primary season: Super Tuesday. Today, 14 states as well as American Samoa1 will be voting in primary elections to allocate delegates to the Democratic National Convention.2

How are the delegates are awarded?

The key number to keep in mind when looking at results is 15%. If a candidate is above 15% in a state or congressional district, the candidate gets delegates proportional to their vote. If you're below 15%, you get nothing.

States award generally 1/3 of delegates statewide, and the other 2/3 by congressional district, with more delegates allocated to districts that have voted more democratic in past Presidential elections.3 So if a candidate is just below the 15% bubble statewide, they still might get a few delegates from individual congressional districts where they broke 15%.

How many delegates are at stake tonight?

There are 1357 delegates up for grabs, out of a total of 3979 total. 1991 delegates are needed to win the nomination.

Today is a much bigger delegate haul up for grabs than in 2016 largely because California moved its primary to today. As both the most populous state and a Democratic stronghold, it has huge delegate numbers, 415, accounting for more than 1/10 of the entire number of delegates available.

When will we know results?

It will vary, with the first polls closing at 7PM ET in Virginia, and the last polls closing at 11PM ET in California.

However, some results may take quite a while. California especially is both the biggest haul today, and famously slow in counting ballots. Because California encourages a lot of mail voting, and counts ballots mailed on election day, they won't have all the ballots in today, and will need to process a lot of envelopes.

Who is gonna win?

Who do I look like, Nate Silver?

I'll add updates as the night goes on, but first I shall engage in my election night tradition: sushi.

Before results come in, feel free to ask any questions you think I can address above, or answer my question:

Besides voting, what election day traditions or habits do you have?

7:00PM ET First polls have closed, and networks are calling Virginia for Biden and Vermont for Sanders at poll closing.

7:07PM ET Looks like the VA call is based on Biden doing very well in the exit poll, which has him around 50% to Bernie's 25%, with all other candidates apparently below the viability threshold. If that held (very big if) it would mean about 66 delegates to Biden, 33 to Bernie, 0 to anyone else.

7:30PM ET Polls have closed in North Carolina, and networks are calling it for Biden at polls close based on the exit poll.

7:37PM ET American Samoa has reported the results of its caucus, which looks like it will give Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard their first delegates of the process. Looks like it'll be 4 delegates for Bloomberg on 175 votes and, 2 for Gabbard on 103 votes.

7:58PM ET Looks like Biden will break the 15% threshold in Vermont, so he will get some delegates there. In 2016 Sanders managed to keep Clinton below that threshold and got all of Vermont's delegates that year.

8:00PM ET Alabama called for Biden at polls closed, no calls in other states closing at 8pm.

8:10PM ET Looks like a genuine three way contest for first in MA based on exit polls among Warren, Sanders, and Biden.

According to the text of the rule ( [https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet](https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet)), the benefits that are included are:

* Supplemental Security Income;

* Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate Rehabilitation);  
* Public Housing (under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.); and

However, most nonimmigrants are ineligible for these benefits  [https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/) .  If there is a U.S. Citizen child in the household that would qualify for the benefits, that is not supposed to be held against the immigrant as the child would be entitled to receive them.

There are certain exceptions to the rule, ie. these are not held against the immigrant for purposes of determining a public charge, and include-

* Emergency medical assistance;  
* Disaster relief;  
* National school lunch programs;  
* The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ;  
* The Children’s Health Insurance Program;  
* Subsidies for foster care and adoption;  
* Government-subsidized student and mortgage loans; 
* Energy assistance;  
* Food pantries and homeless shelters; and 
* Head Start.    

Certain categories of immigrants are also excluded, including refugees, asylees, T and U Visa applicants, and certain VAWA applicants.

How do you hand-count votes under Woodall's Smith+IRV method?,200,f7japz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/f7japz/how_do_you_handcount_votes_under_woodalls/,34,1582354480.0,"My municipality (a small suburb you've never heard of) is currently debating its voting system. Right now, the argument is between First-Past-The-Post and Instant Runoff Voting (we would be able to rank up to six choices).

I want to introduce Woodall's Smith+IRV method into the conversation. Woodall's method is explained [here](https://www.daneckam.com/?p=374) and, more formally, [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20191020185838/https://rangevoting.org/SmithIRV.html).

In a nutshell, Woodall avoids the ""spoiler effect"" of first-past-the-post voting. However, as a Condorcet method, Woodall also avoids the ""center squeeze effect"" of IRV, where consensus Condorcet winners are squeezed out for [no very good reason](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/), which most famously happened in the [2009 Burlington Mayor's race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Burlington_mayoral_election).

Here's the problem, though: while machines are allowed to produce preliminary counts, my state requires that all election totals be hand-counted. (I support this requirement, but it does complicate my preferred voting method.) Our last mayoral race saw about 10,000 votes cast in three precincts. How can we quickly and efficiently hand-count that using Woodall's method?

Meanwhile, for the prelim counts, my state uses optical-scan voting machines with no real capacity for ranking. Getting new voting machines is, for various reasons, not an option. Other cities have gotten around this by using top-3 or top-6 IRV, which allows them to print optical-friendly ballots that look [like this](http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/rcv/HOW-RCV-WORKS).  (Both [Minneapolis](http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/rcv/WCMSP-193817) and [St. Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wFLU3ntWxM) have also come up with fairly clever hand-counting systems for their IRV methods.) 

However, I'm not sure whether limiting voters to 3 choices (or 6 choices) compromises the integrity of Woodall's method. I just don't have the mathematics background to be sure. So limiting it to top-3 may not be an option for me. Even if it is okay, I'm not seeing how to adapt those hand-counting methods to work for Woodall.

I can't really introduce Woodall at the local level without answering these questions. How can we quickly, efficiently, and reliably hand-count Woodall's method? (Can we limit Woodall's method to ranking the top-3 or top-6 choices without compromising the results?) And how can we design our ballots so that our voting machines can provide quick, correct preliminary results on election night? Surely there is *some* literature out there about this!

Thanks for your insights, and also thanks for any resources you can point me toward.

"What constitutes an ""initial policy"" when determining whether a topic represents a political question?",150,f6egr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/f6egr5/what_constitutes_an_initial_policy_when/,10,1582163758.0,"In the landmark 1962 case of [Baker v.

In  making this decision, Justice Brennan outlined several tests  to guide the judiciary when determining whether a topic constituted a  political or legal question. If a topic passed any of the following  tests, it would be considered a political question untouchable by the  judiciary.

These tests were:

1. A textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or
2. A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or
3. The impossibility of deciding without **an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non judicial discretion**; or
4. The  impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without  expressing lack of  the respect due coordinate branches of government;  or
5. An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or
6. The potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by  various departments on one question.

I'm having trouble figuring out what constitutes an ""initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non judicial discretion."" Initially, I thought this test might be referring to cases that would force the courts to *decide* on a specific policy, (instead of merely *ruling out* the unconstitutional policy), but that was the part I wasn't sure on (hence this post).

So I guess my two questions are this:

1. What constitutes an ""initial policy"" when determining whether a topic is considered to be a political question?, and
2. What examples are there, if any, of the judiciary ruling a case to be political for the specific reason of ""initial policy?""

Do the changing sentencing positions of the US government in the Roger Stone case constitute a violation of US law or DoJ policy?,762,f2emhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/f2emhs/do_the_changing_sentencing_positions_of_the_us/,178,1581482478.0,"Yesterday the Department of Justice filed a [sentencing memorandum](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.279.0_2.pdf) for Roger Stone, who had provided information from WikiLeaks to the Trump campaign during 2016.  Stone was convicted in November 2019 by a jury of obstructing a Congressional investigation, making false statements to Congress, and witness tampering.

2. What is the evidence (pro and con) that the president actually ""withheld"" the funds (rather than delayed disbursement, a ""programmatic delay"") and what is the evidence that the decision in September reversed the alleged ""withholding""?
3. The GAO refers to an ongoing inter-agency process to resolve this issue. Has this process been concluded since January 16? If not, what is the evidence for postponing the impeachment trial until it is settled?
4. If the impeachment charge is not for the crime of actual withholding the funds but is for the crime of failing to ""*promptly report the withholding to Congress*"" **then** what is the *evidence* pro and con that he failed to report promptly?

From the ""Final US Emissions Estimates for 2018"" by Rhodium Group, 2018 saw a significant up-tick in US emissions from 2017 after 3 years of decrease. Increases were found in almost every sector: Transportation, Buildings, Power, Industry. Partial justifications for some of these increases include a colder winter--which offsets the energy savings of a cooler summer--and economic growth.

We've also seen environmental regulations systematically removed by the Trump administration. What effect do some of these regulations changes have on our emissions if any?

John Bolton, though, is an interesting figure himself to say the least.

This has been a topic that has been addressed before here in this subreddit, so long-time readers may recall some of the past threads over the years.

Nunes made several claims in his Feb 2018 letter, and within a month it was [announced]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inspector-general-announces-he-will-review-justice-departments-surveillance-of-former-trump-campaign-adviser/2018/03/28/23651efe-32bb-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html) that the Inspector General would be looking into the FISA warrants. 

**Questions presented**

* How do Nunes’ claims hold up now that we have more information? 
* How does the Democratic memo hold up?
* Does the IG’s report support claims made by Nunes and/or the Democrats rebuttal?


Specifically, Nunes said that “material and relevant information was omitted,” from the FISA applications. I will try my best to summarize what Nunes claims below:

1. The initial and renewal applications did not contain information that the DNC paid for Steele’s dossier as a means to obtain derogatory information on Trump’s ties to Russia, and it does not mention that Steele was authorized payment by the FBI. 
2. Furthermore, Fusion GPS’s and Perkins Coie’s roles were not disclosed despite the ties being known by the DOJ.
3. The applications cited a Yahoo News article as corroborating evidence for Steele’s work when in fact Steele leaked his information to Yahoo news. Steele should have been terminated in September but concealed his activities from the FBI.
4. Steele maintained contacts with the FBI through Bruce Ohr, and through Ohr the FBI learned that Steele was biased and that this bias did not make it into the applications or the renewals. Also, Ohr’s wife worked for Fusion GPS and both persons’ ties to Steele and Fusion GPS were concealed from the FISC.
5. Steele’s information wasn’t corroborated at the time of the initial FISA application. Deputy Director McCabe said that that without the Steele dossier, there would have not been a FISA warrant.
6. The FISA warrant mentions Papadopoulos and how it triggered a counterintelligence investigation but does not link them together in a conspiracy.
7. The Strozk/Page text messages are indications of bias.

Meanwhile, then-minority House Democrats and also made a series of claims, which I will again try my best to summarize:

1. FBI and DOJ officials did not “abuse the FISA process, omit material information, or subvert the [FISA process]"" to spy on the Trump campaign
2. The DOJ used a “multi-pronged rationale” that narrowly used Steele’s information along with independent sources
3. The FBI was transparent with the FISC about Steele’s “background, credibility, and potential bias.” The Court was also informed that Steele was terminated as a source for making unauthorized disclosures.
4. The planned DOJ payment against Steele was cancelled.
5. The DOJ appropriately included Papadopoulos in the FISA application, and excluding it would have been negligent.
6. Bruce Ohr’s role was mischaracterized by the Nunes Memo.
7. Peter Strozk and Lisa Page’s text messages are irrelevant.

Note: If I missed something in my summary, please advise and I will try to correct. It's challenging to distill down 15+ pages of accusations and counter-accusations into handful of neutrally-framed sentences, and any omission is unintentional.

FBI and DOJ officials did not “abuse the FISA process, omit material information, or subvert the [FISA process]"" to spy on the Trump campaign The DOJ used a “multi-pronged rationale” that narrowly used Steele’s information along with independent sources The FBI was transparent with the FISC about Steele’s “background, credibility, and potential bias.” The Court was also informed that Steele was terminated as a source for making unauthorized disclosures. The planned DOJ payment against Steele was cancelled. The DOJ appropriately included Papadopoulos in the FISA application, and excluding it would have been negligent. Bruce Ohr’s role was mischaracterized by the Nunes Memo. Peter Strozk and Lisa Page’s text messages are irrelevant.

Note: If I missed something in my summary, please advise and I will try to correct. It's challenging to distill down 15+ pages of accusations and counter-accusations into handful of neutrally-framed sentences, and any omission is unintentional.

It may seem like deja vu, but we are back with a new UK General Election, the third in five years. This is because [a snap election was called by MP's back in October](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-why-boris-johnson-brexit-vote-deal-conservatives-explained-a9201081.html) after a stalemate on the issue of Brexit - this is why it's being dubbed the 'Brexit Election.' If Boris Johnson is to win, he will be able to get Brexit deal done by the 31st.

There are all 650 seats up for grabs - that's a majority requirement of 326 seats.

Current [FT polling](https://www.ft.com/content/263615ca-d873-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17) has the Conservatives at 43%, Labour at 33%. However, with the First Past the Post electoral system, it is hard to know how this will translate into actual seats.

Whatever happens, it will be monumental and set the UK on its course for the next five years - and perhaps even more if the issue of Brexit can be resolved.

You can watch the election as it happens on [BBC news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2019-50755004), or the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/12/general-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). You can also watch a livestream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Auq9mYxFEE) - with special guest, Former Speaker John Bercow.

If you have any questions about this election, please feel free to ask them. This is also an open discussion forum (No Top Level Comment Requirements), so we will be more lenient on the rules, but do not think it makes this a free for all.

**21:19:** As polls enter their final hour, the first rumours of what the electoral landscape might become is leaking out. [Deputy Financial Times Editor Steven Swinford](https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1205218026997596160) has stated that Conservative support in London's constituencies are looking ""difficult"", but are hoping to regain losses in the Leave-voting North of England.

**21:50:** Political Editor for the Sun Newspaper has reported that there is a [50/50 chance on a Hung Parliament/Narrow Conservative Win](https://twitter.com/tnewtondunn/status/1205242626548674563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205242626548674563&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)

**22:01:** The Exit Polls have come in. The Conservatives have 368 seats, with Labour on 191. SNP have 55 seats. That's a 86 majority - Margaret Thatcher levels. If that's true, that's a phenomenal result, and gives Boris is mandate to ""GET BREXIT DONE!"" by the 31st of January. 

These are not the final results, just a poll and should not be trusted completely. There is still a lot that can change.

**22:27:** Where does this leave Labour under Jeremy Corbyn? This is the worst result for Labour since 1935. There are already calls for him to resign, however his shadow cabinet are standing by him - for now.

**22:29:**[ If the 55 out of 58 SNP seats in Scotland](https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1205246386846994441?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) is to be believed, just one shy of their all-time high in 2015, and a 20 seat gain, this will put Scotland at odds with Westminster. A hard right, Leave Conservative government would be clashing with a Remain voting Scottish Nationalist government up north - putting the state of the Union in even more jeopardy. Scotland would want a 2nd Independence Referendum, and claimed this election would give them a mandate to have one, however the Conservatives have put any notion of one away.

**22:42:** The Guardian are reporting that the exit polls suggest that Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson is set to lose her seat in East Dumbartonshire, Scotland.

**22:46:** [The Pound has climbed against the Dollar](https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-pound-wins-as-exit-poll-predicts-big-tory-majority-11884813) and the Euro by almost as much as 5 cents as the exit polls came in, citing stability in the UK political climate and a clearer future. This may also harm the attack that many Remainers used that leaving the EU would harm the UK economy.

**23:17:** Labour's heartlands in the Midlands - the so called Red Wall - is apparently swinging hard to the Conservatives, which is where many of these gains are likely to come from.

**23:26** The traditional race to get the first results are in from Newcastle Central. The results are Con: 9,290  Lab: 21,568 Lib: 2709 Green: 1,365 BXP: 2542. This seat was a Leave voting seat, but the Labour candidate was re-elected by a majority of over 12,000, but this is a 7% loss from 2017.

**23:34** In Sunderland South, Labour lost [18% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000754), and Blyth swung from Labour to Tory after they lost [15% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000575). These are all traditional Labour seats - and many were narrow vote Leave seats.

**00:32**[ Swindon North hold for Conservatives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000851). Doubled Labour's vote. Labour are down 8% here.

**01:03** A Labour seat that they won by over 10k votes in 2017 has [gone to a recount](https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1205289992840458241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205289992840458241&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This does not look good for the Labour Party.

**01:40** So far, Conservatives have gained 3 seats, SNP gained 1 seat, and Labour have lost 4 seats. We have only just begun. However, if these numbers are to be believed, the Exit Poll seems to be more or less accurate.

**02:03:** The first Labour gain has come in from Putney. The gain [has given Labour a 6% lead](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205304811979182080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205304811979182080&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This is a London seat and was expected to swing to Labour.

**02:32:** Results so far - 52 Conservatives, 47 Labour, 7 Scottish Nationalists, 1 Liberal Democrats, 5 ""OTHERS"".

**02:46:** Results so far - 78 Con, 68 Lab, 13 SNP, 1 Lib Dem, 5 ""Others""

Currently, Labour has lost, on average, a share of votes of around 10%. This is almost historic. Most swings are between 2-4%. Tony Blair only surpassed this with a 15% swing in favour in 1998

**02:58** Chuka Unama, a former Conservative who joined the Liberal Democrats, [has lost his seat to the Conservaitves.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000639) This comes after both Labour and Liberal Democrats - a self proclaimed Remain alliance - ended up splitting the vote. If they voted tactically, they would have won by more than 6k votes.

**03:09:** DUP's Deputy Leader, Nigel Dodds, has lost [his seat to Sinn Fein](https://www.itv.com/news/utv/2019-12-13/live-counting-underway-at-centres-across-ni/)

**03:19:** Liberal Democrats [gained a Conservative seat, the first of the night](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205325042067935232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205325042067935232&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)

**03:35** It is expected that Jeremy Corbyn is going to stand down after this election, after stating that he ""will not lead the Labour Party into another General Election""

**03:52** Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has lost [her seat to the SNP by just over 100 seats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50771123). It will be expected for her to resign, and a new leader to be elected - the fourth in the past 2 years.

So I know enough to know the House ""indicts"" the president by impeaching him and the Senate ""convicts"" so this is at least two questions.

1. What are the normal restrictions on the House or Senate rules for anonymous/private votes and how would the apply for the actual Impeachment and Conviction? Is this a constitutional or legal restraint or just a political or ""Norms"" one for the binding votes?
2.  Even if the Senate cannot convict on private votes, given the hypothetical circumstances of a runaway Executive Branch, would it make sense for the House to call for a body wide anonymous vote?  Even if it is non-binding, just showing support and legitimacy of the ""Impeachment Process"" and proceedings before it is passed to the Senate? Is THAT possible by rule? Basically allow lawmakers to show whether they believe the President is acting against the constitution, but the vote being private allows them cover to vote their conscience without the public blow-back.","I came across a quote by Jeff Flake in news articles around September

>[Since the beginning of whistleblowing in America, government whistleblowers who put their name and face on their revelations have not fared well, particularly those from the intelligence community. They are typically tarred in the media, often prosecuted and almost inevitably fired and blackballed from further government service. “So far as I’m aware, from [Daniel] Ellsberg to the present day, there hasn't been a single case in which a genuine whistleblower who exposed major problems in the intelligence community has experienced anything other than retaliation,” Patrick Eddington, a former CIA employee who revealed that his agency and the military were covering up U.S. soldiers’ exposure to toxins during the 1991 Iraq War, told me. Especially in an unstable, emotionally charged, politically polarized era like the one in which the current whistleblower is operating, government truth-tellers are all too easily vilified as traitors, deflecting attention from the problems they are attempting to reveal. ](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/26/whistleblower-identity-ukraine-history-of-retaliation-228324)

Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Liberal) faces Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, as well as NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, Green leader Elizabeth May, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the new People's Party leader Maxime Bernier.

Polls have now closed across Canada.

For those not up on Canadian geography and wondering ""Does Canada really span 6 time zones?"" Yes, [Canada is really big.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhiDILWFXBE)


[Polls have forecast that it is most likely no party will win a majority of the seats in Parliament.](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/)  

In that event, there may be significant political jockeying over who can successfully hold the Prime Minister's office.

If you want a very detailed view of the law around forming government,^2 [this article from Professor Philippe Lagassé is an excellent overview.](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/constitutional_forum/index.php/constitutional_forum/article/view/29384/21386)

As the night goes on, I may refer back to that piece in discussing government formation and minority or coalition government scenarios.

Once polls start closing I will begin a tick tock with results and other relevant news.

**4:32 PM EDT** Re: some questions in the comments, I am gonna talk a little bit about how things work in a minority government situation.

* As incumbent Prime Minister, Trudeau remains in office until and unless he resigns or is dismissed by the Governor General (GG) (Lagassé p. 6).

* There is a custom, not rule, that the party with the most seats will usually serve as the government.  If Trudeau's Liberals do not have the most seats, and he follows this custom, he would resign to allow the party with the most seats to form government. (Lagassé p. 11)

* If Trudeau does not resign as PM, when Parliament reconvenes, he will face a vote to test [whether he has the confidence of the Commons](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_02_2-e.html) (the vote on the address in reply to the speech from the throne).

* If Trudeau passes that vote, he stays as PM.

* If Trudeau fails that vote, he could either resign, or advise the Governor General to call a snap election.

* If Trudeau resigned after losing confidence, the GG would choose the person the GG thought most likely to hold the confidence of the Commons, by practice the leader of the opposition is that person. (Lagassé p. 8)

* If Trudeau advised a snap election after losing confidence, the GG would decide whether she thought there was another viable government.  

 * If she thinks another viable government exists, she would refuse Trudeau's advice, and appoint an alternate government.  Trudeau would be forced to resign, or be formally dismissed if he did not resign. (Lagassé p. 6)

 * If she thinks another viable government does not exist, she would agree to the advice, dissolve Parliament, and call a snap election.  Trudeau would remain PM through such a snap election. (Lagassé p. 8)

**6:35 PM EDT** Added some live stream links up top.

**7:00 PM EDT** Polls are now closed in Newfoundland and Labrador.

**7:20 PM EDT**  Liberals leading in 3 ridings that have results so far - all ridings they are expected to win.

**7:30 PM EDT** Polls closed in the maritime provinces now.  Will have a 2 hour wait from now until we get the big poll closing for QC/ON/MB/SK/AB/Territories.

**7:44 PM EDT Lib:2** Two seats called in Newfoundland for the Liberals, in seats they were pretty comfortably expected to hold.  Conservatives not leading in many seats but seem to be improving on 2015 in raw vote counts so far.

**8:00 PM EDT Lib: 5**  Lot of seats in NS and NB where conservatives are looking good, but very few votes in so far.  NDP looks likely to get a flip in Saint John's East.

**8:23 PM EDT Lib: 8; NDP: 1** First flip of the night.  NDP has taken Saint John's East from the Liberals.  Conservatives are leading in 6 seats (all previously Liberal) but have not gotten any of them called for them.  About an hour still until we get the giant polls close from all of Canada except BC, so will be lots more parsing Atlantic Canada for a while yet.

**8:41 PM EDT Lib 12; Con 2; NDP 1**  Conservatives have their first flips of the night, both in New Brunswick along the Maine border.  Leading in a few more in NB, lots of very close races there, as well as a few close ones in NS.

**8:45 PM EDT Lib 14; Con 2; NDP 1** Greens are now leading in Fredericton but not elected there yet.  Conservatives in 2nd there right now. 

**9:06 PM EDT Lib 18; Con 3; NDP 1** Added a French stream from TVA above.  Also interesting we have some votes from Gaspe area because of the time zone.  Liberal incumbent leading the Bloc candidate by a little bit, but not much in yet.

**9:26 PM EDT Lib 19; Con 3; NDP 1**  Ok just before the huge polls close, looks like the Liberals are decently positioned to hold a plurality.

**9:58 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Liberals are leading in 94 seats and are only seeing a net swing of -6 so far, which is really strong for them, since they could lose about 16 and still have a majority.

**11:28 PM EDT Lib 115; Con 100; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2**  Liberals are going to be locked out of having any seats in Alberta and probably Saskatchewan, which could be a problem for regional divisions.

Liberal minority projected

Happy election day!

Today is election day in Canada, with voters going to the polls to elect 338 members of Parliament across the country. Each member is elected in a first past the post election from a single district called a ""riding.""1

Live Streams

(I am looking for a French live stream if anyone can point me to one; can't seem to find one on the Radio-Canada site)

Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Liberal) faces Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, as well as NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, Green leader Elizabeth May, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the new People's Party leader Maxime Bernier.

Polls have now closed across Canada.

For those not up on Canadian geography and wondering ""Does Canada really span 6 time zones?"" Yes, Canada is really big.

Polls have forecast that it is most likely no party will win a majority of the seats in Parliament.

In that event, there may be significant political jockeying over who can successfully hold the Prime Minister's office.

If you want a very detailed view of the law around forming government,2 this article from Professor Philippe Lagassé is an excellent overview.

As the night goes on, I may refer back to that piece in discussing government formation and minority or coalition government scenarios.

Once polls start closing I will begin a tick tock with results and other relevant news.

4:32 PM EDT Re: some questions in the comments, I am gonna talk a little bit about how things work in a minority government situation.

As incumbent Prime Minister, Trudeau remains in office until and unless he resigns or is dismissed by the Governor General (GG) (Lagassé p. 6).

There is a custom, not rule, that the party with the most seats will usually serve as the government. If Trudeau's Liberals do not have the most seats, and he follows this custom, he would resign to allow the party with the most seats to form government. (Lagassé p. 11)

If Trudeau does not resign as PM, when Parliament reconvenes, he will face a vote to test whether he has the confidence of the Commons (the vote on the address in reply to the speech from the throne).

If Trudeau passes that vote, he stays as PM.

If Trudeau fails that vote, he could either resign, or advise the Governor General to call a snap election.

If Trudeau resigned after losing confidence, the GG would choose the person the GG thought most likely to hold the confidence of the Commons, by practice the leader of the opposition is that person. (Lagassé p. 8)

If Trudeau advised a snap election after losing confidence, the GG would decide whether she thought there was another viable government.

If she thinks another viable government exists, she would refuse Trudeau's advice, and appoint an alternate government. Trudeau would be forced to resign, or be formally dismissed if he did not resign. (Lagassé p. 6)

If she thinks another viable government does not exist, she would agree to the advice, dissolve Parliament, and call a snap election. Trudeau would remain PM through such a snap election. (Lagassé p. 8)

6:35 PM EDT Added some live stream links up top.

7:00 PM EDT Polls are now closed in Newfoundland and Labrador.

7:20 PM EDT Liberals leading in 3 ridings that have results so far - all ridings they are expected to win.

7:30 PM EDT Polls closed in the maritime provinces now. Will have a 2 hour wait from now until we get the big poll closing for QC/ON/MB/SK/AB/Territories.

7:44 PM EDT Lib:2 Two seats called in Newfoundland for the Liberals, in seats they were pretty comfortably expected to hold. Conservatives not leading in many seats but seem to be improving on 2015 in raw vote counts so far.

8:00 PM EDT Lib: 5 Lot of seats in NS and NB where conservatives are looking good, but very few votes in so far. NDP looks likely to get a flip in Saint John's East.

8:23 PM EDT Lib: 8; NDP: 1 First flip of the night. NDP has taken Saint John's East from the Liberals. Conservatives are leading in 6 seats (all previously Liberal) but have not gotten any of them called for them. About an hour still until we get the giant polls close from all of Canada except BC, so will be lots more parsing Atlantic Canada for a while yet.

8:41 PM EDT Lib 12; Con 2; NDP 1 Conservatives have their first flips of the night, both in New Brunswick along the Maine border. Leading in a few more in NB, lots of very close races there, as well as a few close ones in NS.

8:45 PM EDT Lib 14; Con 2; NDP 1 Greens are now leading in Fredericton but not elected there yet. Conservatives in 2nd there right now.

9:06 PM EDT Lib 18; Con 3; NDP 1 Added a French stream from TVA above. Also interesting we have some votes from Gaspe area because of the time zone. Liberal incumbent leading the Bloc candidate by a little bit, but not much in yet.

9:26 PM EDT Lib 19; Con 3; NDP 1 Ok just before the huge polls close, looks like the Liberals are decently positioned to hold a plurality. Will be interesting how much the Bloc can take both from the other 3 parties with QC seats in the overall balance of power. They are now leading in the Gaspe seat. This will be a long night.

There has been bipartisan criticism of companies like the NBA, who claim to support progressive social issues, yet are unwilling to speak up about human rights abuses by the Chinese government.

Anecdotally, I’ve noticed oikophobic sentiments among various political and cultural institutions in America. The New York Times claims the first Atlantic slave ship from 1619 marks the true founding of the United States. Nike pulls back from releasing a shoe with Revolutionary War symbology because of America’s history with slavery. White progressives have been shown to possess a bias in favor of outgroups in a recent study.

2. Specific to the ongoing Ukraine story with President Trump, are there any legal issues raised when a President asks a foreign nation to investigate US citizens? What about political opponents, other groups?

Élections Canada a des informations détaillées sur la logistique du vote. Si vous êtes un citoyen canadien âgé de 18 ans, vous avez légalement le droit de voter. Le vote en avance, le vote par correspondance et l'inscription sur les listes électorales le jour même sont disponibles.

Changement par rapport aux élections précédentes: électeurs résidant à l'étranger

Il n'est plus nécessaire d'avoir vécu récemment au Canada pour pouvoir voter. En janvier de cette année, la Cour suprême a statué que les citoyens canadiens ont le droit de voter à leur dernière adresse au Canada, peu importe combien de temps ils ont passé en dehors du territoire. Donc, si vous êtes un expatrié canadien de longue durée vous pouvez demander à être inscrit sur la Registre international des électeurs et de voter par la poste.

Changement par rapport aux élections précédentes: débats officiels des candidats

La Commission des débats des chefs, nouvellement créée pour cette élection, organisera deux débats entre les chefs des partis, un en Anglais et un en Français.

Le débat en Anglais aura lieu le lundi 7 octobre.

Le débat en Français aura lieule jeudi 10 octobre.

Comment les élections fonctionnent au Canada

Il y aura un scrutin uninominal majoritaire à un tour pour les 338 sièges à la Chambre des communes. Chaque siège représente un district géographique, appelé «circonscription», qui représente une région spécifique d'une province (ou, dans le cas des territoires, de l'ensemble du territoire). Les candidats s'affilient généralement à un parti politique. Si un seul parti remporte la majorité des sièges, il formera un gouvernement par convention. Si aucun parti ne remporte la majorité, les partis peuvent alors négocier pour former une coalition ou le parti ayant la majorité relative peut chercher à obtenir un gouvernement minoritaire, ce qu'il peut faire tant qu'il ne perd pas une motion de censure."

Today, Corey Lewandowski is still being questioned on the floor of the House Judiciary Committee concerning his testimony in the Mueller Report. Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager and continued associate within the Trump White House has repeatedly cited another [White House letter](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Nadler.1.9.16.2019%20WH%20letter%20re%20Corey%20Lewandowski.pdf) stating he is being compelled not to answer pertinent questions leveled at him by members of the House Judiciary Committee. Lewandowski's testimony is also a matter of public record, recorded within the pages of the [the Mueller Report](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5955997-Muellerreport).

Highly relevant to these developments is the actual content of the Mueller Report. Significant evidence stands within the Mueller Report highlighting conduct that is [widely perceived as potential obstruction of justice by over 1000 former Federal Prosecutors](https://medium.com/@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1), pending congressional action. Inspection by legal experts has revealed that Mueller laid forth evidence in [Volume II, sections E, F, I, and J](https://www.lawfareblog.com/obstruction-justice-mueller-report-heat-map), indicating significant evidence supporting all three elements of the charge:

1. An Obstructive Act
2. Nexus to a pending or contemplated official Proceeding
3. Corrupt Intent (see [Mueller Report](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5955997-Muellerreport): Vol. II pp. 9, 10 for a full description of these elements).

The same legal analysis indicates evidence in sections B, D, J [see Roger Stone redacted content], and K [see Cohen Cooperation] could also possibly support the fulfillment of all three elements of obstruction of justice. The final interpretation of the Mueller Report that would lead to any potential official action against the President is still a matter of congressional responsibility as the [Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel opinion](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2000/10/31/op-olc-v024-p0222_0.pdf) states:
> The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.

Mr. Mueller and his team have therefore taken it as their instruction to not consider any possible indictments and only lay forth the verifiable acts as they found them.

My questions are as follows:

1. Is the Department of Justice operating within legal precedent to grant testimonial immunity to White House aides who have already testified to investigators and whose testimony is already a matter of public record?
2. Does the White House have the legal authority to instruct Corey Lewandowski, a private citizen, to not comply with the questioning of the House Judiciary Committee?
3. Is there any previous precedent where a private citizen submitted to a subpoena issued by a Special Counsel's Office, but did not answer the ensuing questions from members of the House of Representatives?
4. Finally, should this new method of shielding Lewandowski and White House aides from rigorous congressional questioning be itself an area of constitutional concern for this congress?","Today the White House submitted letters effectively blocking the testimony of Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter.

I'm interested if someone has studied the degree of this correlation, especially in the context of [Shannon entropy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_\(information_theory\)).

A Shannon entropy of 1 bit/voter bit means voters are maximally ""tribal"". If you ask a voter ""Are you a liberal?"" the answer will tell you their position on all the issues. If there are 10 issues, a Shannon entropy of 10 bits/voter means voters are ""critical thinkers"" -- knowing their position on one issue does not give you any information about the others.

If there are 10 issues I'm interested in seeing where the electorate stands. Is it more tribal, close to 1 bit/voter? Or more independently minded, close to the theoretical maximum of say 7 bits/voter? Does anyone have data on the Shannon entropy per voter on key policy issues?

Is there evidence suggesting the most effective set of policies for the use of police body cameras?,511,cpigdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/cpigdn/is_there_evidence_suggesting_the_most_effective/,62,1565672095.0,"The United States is three years into the spike in adoption of police body cameras and [studies show some unexpected results.](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2019/0809/The-body-cam-revolution-What-it-has-and-hasn-t-accomplished)

According to the [National Conference of State Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/body-worn-cameras-interactive-graphic.aspx#/), laws in some states treat body camera recordings as public records, but provide standards and many caveats for when police may withhold, redact or obscure certain videos.

Some of these seem to suggest that departure from a metals-backed currency, and fractional reserve banking, are major contributing factors. 

Let's imagine that tomorrow, the USA announces that from now on every US dollar will be backed by a certain set amount of some hard asset - gold, silver, lithium, maybe even THC crystals, doesn't matter -- something, that has to be mined, refined, grown, or something so that it can't simply be created out of thin air by the stroke of a pen / keyboard, you know what i mean. It might be something of which there is a finite amount on earth (like gold and other metals) or something that can be created only through some process that requires labor and resources (THC, or maybe rice or biodiesel or whatever you can think of).  So the US can't print another US dollar until it mines/produces another unit of the material that backs the dollar. 

At the same time, a law is passed (oh yeah also a magic genie appears and makes it so all banks become perfectly lawful and no bank attempts to violate the law -- we're ignoring the effects of criminality for now) and this new law states that banks must now end fractional reserve lending. So in order to give you a loan for ten thousand dollars, the bank has to actually HAVE ten thousand dollars on their books to give you. And once they've given that ten thousand to you, their balance goes down by ten thousand, and they cannot loan the same ten thousand dollars to anyone else at the same time. The bank cannot lend out another dollar until they receive another dollar from somewhere. Banks can no longer lend money they don't actually have. 

In this scenario, what effects might we reasonably expect to see?","I am not a student of economics but I am trying to wrap my head around how income and wealth inequality reached their current levels in the USA and what could potentially be done about it.

He also concluded that a BDS solution will not achieve what the Palestinians are ultimately looking for (recognition of rights and legitimacy):

*“I oppose criminalizing the BDS-movement and have stayed off bills that do so or impose any penalty. The First Amendment is a key foundation of our country that we must protect. Nothing in the Schneider resolution that I cosponsored infringes on any American’s First Amendment right to protest the U.S. or any foreign country, and I advocated with other progressives to have that clarifying language included. I have supported numerous pieces of legislation that prevented any U.S. funds from being used towards the unlawful detention of Palestinian children and have stood up for the human rights of Palestinian children—but like Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and other progressive leaders, I do not believe BDS will help achieve either a two state solution or the recognition of rights for Palestinians. We should continue to work to find constructive ways to achieve peace and a resolution to the conflict.”*

Khanna, Rep. Pressley, Rep. Gabbard, and Rep. Porter claiming that not only did the resolution take away Palestinians right to protest but, it also allowed Israel to intrude in on Palestinian land.

Does the resolution as passed by the house infringe on first amendment rights of the Palestinians by denouncing Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) in foreign lands?

I am also wondering, for my personal knowledge, if this resolution is actionable despite being a non-binding resolution passed by the House?

He also concluded that a BDS solution will not achieve what the Palestinians are ultimately looking for (recognition of rights and legitimacy):

“I oppose criminalizing the BDS-movement and have stayed off bills that do so or impose any penalty. The First Amendment is a key foundation of our country that we must protect. Nothing in the Schneider resolution that I cosponsored infringes on any American’s First Amendment right to protest the U.S. or any foreign country, and I advocated with other progressives to have that clarifying language included. I have supported numerous pieces of legislation that prevented any U.S. funds from being used towards the unlawful detention of Palestinian children and have stood up for the human rights of Palestinian children—but like Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and other progressive leaders, I do not believe BDS will help achieve either a two state solution or the recognition of rights for Palestinians. We should continue to work to find constructive ways to achieve peace and a resolution to the conflict.”

Multiple talk show hosts and journalists, who consider their political lining on the 'progressive left', have denounced the 'yes' votes on the Resolution from Rep. Khanna, Rep. Pressley, Rep. Gabbard, and Rep. Porter claiming that not only did the resolution take away Palestinians right to protest but, it also allowed Israel to intrude in on Palestinian land. In addition, they argue that the resolution is built to economically support the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel Lobby committee.

Does the resolution as passed by the house infringe on first amendment rights of the Palestinians by denouncing Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) in foreign lands?

I am also wondering, for my personal knowledge, if this resolution is actionable despite being a non-binding resolution passed by the House?

Thanks in advance."
Is it ultimately legal for a state government to refuse enrollment of children who have a religious reason to not vaccinate?,30,chssta,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/chssta/is_it_ultimately_legal_for_a_state_government_to/,29,1564114027.0,"Several states have recently removed the exception process for children to attend public schools if they have a religious exception to being vaccinated.

Hello everyone! 

Thank you all for the continued support to make this sub the strong community it is. Our sub relies on active, committed, and passionate moderators, and to that end we're putting out an open request for new mod applications to make sure we can keep the discussion at the level you expect.

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have time. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend an hour or more reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.

Second, you need to be familiar with [our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. Mods read all submissions, and we make an effort to read all comments as well. The vast majority of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and/or work with them to craft an acceptable post. Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

We also make heavy use of browser extensions to assist us with our work, so you will need to be able to moderate from a computer with a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, and be willing to install a few extensions.

Other responsibilities include:

* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.
* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.
* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.
* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.

If you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with the following info:

* A brief explanation of why you want to join the team
* Why you would be a good fit
* Your time zone, or what time you would be available to help moderate
* Which forest animal you would be and why

* Do not tell us your political leaning. **Any application that includes such information will automatically be disqualified.**

We look forward to hearing from you.","EDIT: The application period is now closed. Thank you to everyone who applied. We'll make an announcement to introduce the new team members when they've been added.

Pros and Cons:Should the military should lower the minimum enlistment age from 17 to 16?,57,cg97ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/cg97ge/pros_and_consshould_the_military_should_lower_the/,159,1563802645.0,">As the [Army](https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/army/), Navy and other services contend with a thriving economy and a directive to expand their ranks, there is a growing debate over whether the military should consider lowering the minimum enlistment age from 17 to 16. More than a dozen countries, including the United Kingdom, already have adopted the policy.

>Critics say the idea is deeply flawed and presents a host of societal problems, but supporters argue that the Pentagon needs to think outside the box if it wants to continually overcome one of the toughest recruiting environments in decades.

>Neither the military nor lawmakers have given any indication that they are entertaining the idea, but some analysts say that opening the ranks to younger Americans could provide unique benefits and may be the kind of fundamental overhaul the recruiting system needs for the 21st century.

>To combat the growing military-civilian divide, the military must be willing to change its recruiting tactics amid changing times, and many senior leaders are supportive of this idea. [**LINK**](https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2019/07/10/why-we-should-lower-the-age-for-recruitment-to-16/)","As the Army, Navy and other services contend with a thriving economy and a directive to expand their ranks, there is a growing debate over whether the military should consider lowering the minimum enlistment age from 17 to 16. More than a dozen countries, including the United Kingdom, already have adopted the policy.

Critics say the idea is deeply flawed and presents a host of societal problems, but supporters argue that the Pentagon needs to think outside the box if it wants to continually overcome one of the toughest recruiting environments in decades.

Neither the military nor lawmakers have given any indication that they are entertaining the idea, but some analysts say that opening the ranks to younger Americans could provide unique benefits and may be the kind of fundamental overhaul the recruiting system needs for the 21st century.

“For one, many of the factors that disqualify older youths from joining — like criminal records — are not as present in younger teens,” said Shane McCarthy, chief marketing officer of Sandboxx, a leading technology platform that connects military members stationed abroad with families and friends at home. Mr. McCarthy also has advised military commands on how to better target recruits. LINK"

I have a few questions on this topic:

1) What authority did Alexander Acosta have to make the punishment against Jeffery Epstein more severe? How much responsibility on deciding the sentencing rests with Acosta?

2) Was Jeffery Epstein's punishment on ""soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14"" in the state of Florida unusual? In terms of time served, fines, sex registration, and prison/jail treatment, what evidence is there that Epstein was given preferential treatment?

3) Several prosecutors have stated Acosta's deal was unusual in terms of how Epstein was treated, but also how it affected an FBI probe and granted immunity to potential co-conspirators.

[Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/supreme-court-gerrymandering-census.html). This last week, SCOTUS ruled on a two major gerrymandering cases, one favoring democrats and another favoring republicans.

In both cases before the court, NC and MD, one party felt that a state's districts were unfairly drawn to give one political party a significant advantage.  Whether you agree with SCOTUS or not, they do not intend to accept any kind of standard for when a district is ""too gerrymandered"" and have left it to states to decide how to redraw their districts.

Article. This last week, SCOTUS ruled on a two major gerrymandering cases, one favoring democrats and another favoring republicans.

In both cases before the court, NC and MD, one party felt that a state's districts were unfairly drawn to give one political party a significant advantage. Whether you agree with SCOTUS or not, they do not intend to accept any kind of standard for when a district is ""too gerrymandered"" and have left it to states to decide how to redraw their districts.

In regards to the threats:

* Who is normally responsible for returning these lawmakers to do their jobs?

### Absolute immunity definition.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity) has the following definition:

> Absolute immunity is a form of legal immunity for government officials that confers total immunity from criminal prosecution and lawsuits so long as they are acting within the scope of their duties.

[Julian Epstein](https://www.nationalmemo.com/former-counsel-hicks-cant-claim-absolute-immunity-may-invoke-fifth-amendment/), former Democratic chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee says:

> “Absolute immunity would be a claim by the White House that none of the staff or the president need to answer any questions in a congressional proceeding or a legal proceeding,” Epstein explained to CNN, quickly adding that when President Richard Nixon tried to claim absolute immunity during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that there was no such thing.

Chairman Nadler characterizes it on pg 11 of the transcript as:

> Chairman Nadler: With all due respect, that is absolute nonsense as a matter of law.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/politics/explainer-congressional-testimony-limits/index.html) references a [OLC memo](https://www.justice.gov/file/30896/download) from 2014 which states:

> For the President’s absolute immunity to be fully meaningful, and for these
separation of powers principles to be adequately protected, the President’s
immediate advisers must likewise have absolute immunity from congressional
compulsion to testify about matters that occur during the course of discharging
their official duties.

### Transcript of the testimony.

Here is the [transcript ](https://www.lawfareblog.com/transcript-hope-hicks-interview-house-judiciary-committee) of Hope Hicks House testimony.

[Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/20/hope-hicks-refused-questions-house-testimony-1374240) counted **155 objections**.

---

### Some key points, and context.

- Ms. Hicks was accompanied by her personal lawyers, White House lawyers, and a DoJ lawyer.
- As far as I can tell, White House counsel is the one doing all of the objections.
- This is not executive privilege.

Pg. 17 of the transcript.

> Chairman Nadler: Are you asserting executive privilege in declining to answer the question?

> Ms. Hicks: No.

Pg. 18.

> Chairman Nadler:  Now, Mr. Purpura, on behalf of the White House, are you asserting any other basis for declining to answer the question other than absolute immunity?

> Mr. Purpura: No.

---

- *Absolute immunity* from answering **all** questions about **any** topics for the period of January 20, 2017 thru March 29, 2018.

Pg. 21.

> Chairman Nadler: In other words, you are asserting absolute immunity that she cannot testify as to any knowledge of anything that occurred after the President was inaugurated?

...

> Mr. Purpura: For the purpose of this hearing, yes.

...

> Mr. Purpura: Under the terms of the absolute immunity described in Mr. Cipollone's letter, she may not speak about anything that occurred during the time of her employment in the White House as a close adviser to the President.

Chairman Nadler asks if a non-existent war happened.

Pg. 22.

> Chairman Nadler:  Anything that occurred during that time?

> Chairman Nadler: Did a war break out between Israel and Egypt during that time period?

> Mr. Purpura: Same objection.


---

I'm not sure how to categorize this exchange. This happens throughout the interview. WH counsel objects to Ms. Hicks answering the question directly, but doesn't object to her reading the answer from the Mueller Report.

Pg. 35-36.

> Chairman Nadler: Do you recall the President giving a live interview the same day as the July 19th, 2017, meeting with Mr. Lewandowski, the meeting where you typed the notes?

> Mr. Purpura: Objection.

> Chairman Nadler: I'd like to introduce pages 93 to 94 of volume two, including footnote 636 of the Mueller report. Can you please read out loud the highlighted portion into the record?

> Ms. Hicks: Within hours of the President's meeting with Lewandowski on July 19th, 2017, the President gave an unplanned
interview to The New York Times in which he criticized Sessions' decision to recuse from the Russia investigation.","The White House, citing absolute immunity, directed Hope Hicks to refuse to answer any and all questions pertaining to the time frame around her tenure as White House Communications Director.

“Absolute immunity would be a claim by the White House that none of the staff or the president need to answer any questions in a congressional proceeding or a legal proceeding,” Epstein explained to CNN, quickly adding that when President Richard Nixon tried to claim absolute immunity during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that there was no such thing.

Chairman Nadler characterizes it on pg 11 of the transcript as:

Chairman Nadler: With all due respect, that is absolute nonsense as a matter of law.

CNN references a OLC memo from 2014 which states:

For the President’s absolute immunity to be fully meaningful, and for these separation of powers principles to be adequately protected, the President’s immediate advisers must likewise have absolute immunity from congressional compulsion to testify about matters that occur during the course of discharging their official duties.

Transcript of the testimony.

Here is the transcript of Hope Hicks House testimony.

Politico counted 155 objections.

Some key points, and context.

Ms. Hicks was accompanied by her personal lawyers, White House lawyers, and a DoJ lawyer.

As far as I can tell, White House counsel is the one doing all of the objections.

This is not executive privilege.

Pg. 17 of the transcript.

Chairman Nadler: Are you asserting executive privilege in declining to answer the question?

Ms. Hicks: No.

Pg. 18.

Chairman Nadler: Now, Mr. Purpura, on behalf of the White House, are you asserting any other basis for declining to answer the question other than absolute immunity?

Mr. Purpura: No.

Absolute immunity from answering all questions about any topics for the period of January 20, 2017 thru March 29, 2018.

Pg. 21.

Chairman Nadler: In other words, you are asserting absolute immunity that she cannot testify as to any knowledge of anything that occurred after the President was inaugurated?

...

Mr. Purpura: For the purpose of this hearing, yes.

...

Mr. Purpura: Under the terms of the absolute immunity described in Mr. Cipollone's letter, she may not speak about anything that occurred during the time of her employment in the White House as a close adviser to the President.

Chairman Nadler asks if a non-existent war happened.

Pg. 22.

Chairman Nadler: Anything that occurred during that time?

Chairman Nadler: Did a war break out between Israel and Egypt during that time period?

Mr. Purpura: Same objection.

I'm not sure how to categorize this exchange. This happens throughout the interview. WH counsel objects to Ms. Hicks answering the question directly, but doesn't object to her reading the answer from the Mueller Report.

Pg. 35-36.

Chairman Nadler: Do you recall the President giving a live interview the same day as the July 19th, 2017, meeting with Mr. Lewandowski, the meeting where you typed the notes?

Mr. Purpura: Objection.

Chairman Nadler: I'd like to introduce pages 93 to 94 of volume two, including footnote 636 of the Mueller report. Can you please read out loud the highlighted portion into the record?"

A recent situation is when emotional support animals are being claimed as being applicable under the ADA.

"How has ""Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act"" (2000) affected boxing in the US? What would be the effects of expanding it to cover MMA fighters?",451,c1z103,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/c1z103/how_has_muhammad_ali_boxing_reform_act_2000/,15,1560870125.0,"Background:

* The [Ali Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Boxing_Reform_Act) was enacted in 2000 to address problems in American professional boxing, especially exploitation of athletes and conflicts of interest rampant among promoters. For example, by requiring boxing promotions to disclose financial information, it hoped to stop promotions from downplaying the income generated by fighters--which would in turn lead to fighters receiving a larger cut. It also hoped to make rankings more objective and harder to manipulate.

* Congressman [Markwayne Mullin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markwayne_Mullin) (R-OK) has introduced a related bill, the [Muhammad Ali Expansion Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/44). As the name implies, it would amend the original Ali Act to include mixed martial arts fighters. This is the second time Mullin has introduced the bill.

* While potential expansion has been discussed in MMA circles from time to time ([e.g., here's something from 2016](https://www.mmafighting.com/2016/6/12/11911444/click-debate-whats-all-this-talk-about-the-ali-act-coming-to-mma)), support of the bill by Democratic candidate Andrew Yang ([policy link](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/empowering-mma-fighters/)) has brought greater attention to the issue. (That's how I heard about it; of course, this thread is not about anything else related to Yang.)

* The UFC opposes expanding the Ali Act to include MMA. Of course it's easy to be cynical about this position, but I'd be interested in any good-faith [steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) arguments here. For example, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/PFgR2gbzgiI) offering some criticisms of the need for the expansion bill. Also, it's worth remembering that the UFC is not the only MMA organization in the US

* As a general observation, professional boxers make much more money than professional MMA fighters. But this is not only due to fairer contract design; it's also because boxing is just a more popular sport, both for audiences (bigger revenue pool) and athletes (bigger talent pool).

* Fun fact: Congressman Mullin has a professional MMA record of 3-0. Bonus fun fact: Congresswoman [Sharice Davids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharice_Davids) (D-KS) is also a former professional MMA fighter. Bonus bonus coincidence: They are both of Native American heritage.

Questions:

1. Were these genuine problems in boxing at the time of the Ali Act's passage?

2. Are these less of a problem now?

3. If so, can this improvement be attributed to the Ali Act? 

4. Has enforcement of the Ali Act been effective?

5. General question: What have we learned about combat sports regulation with the benefit of 19 years of hindsight?

6. Are these a real problem in MMA now?

7. What are some potential downsides of expanding the Ali Act to include MMA?

8. What are some potential benefits?

9. If MMA does suffer from problems that plagued boxing before 2000, are there plausible alternative ways to address them that would avoid the downsides of amending the Ali Act?","Background:

Or did the legislature simply try two different strategies for passing the same protections, in which one strategy tried to get the protections passed all at once through a single bill, and the other strategy tried to get the protections passed individually through two separate bills?

Here is some history to ground the discussion:

Chavez' reign from 98-2007 was largely marked by increased political participation (in particular by marginilised groups)

and ambitious social programmes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_missions .

Why does every Virginia governor issue an executive order banning forms of discrimination that are already illegal under both federal and state law?,517,bvlsua,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/bvlsua/why_does_every_virginia_governor_issue_an/,99,1559430728.0,"Every governor of Virginia since Linwood Holton has signed an executive order banning the state workforce from engaging in racial, religious, or sex-based discrimination.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832) Recent governors have expanded these executive orders to include further protections, some of which are not currently covered by federal or state law, such as protections on the basis of sexual orientation and on the basis of gender identity.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832)[[2]](
https://augustafreepress.com/lieutenant-governor-northam-casts-tiebreaking-vote-end-employment-discrimination-state-government/)

I'm not familiar with how to read legal documents, but if I'm understanding [this page](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/) correctly, it seems that Virginia may not have had any anti-discrimination laws until the 1980s. Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time. 

But as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact? 

Making matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[[4]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0)[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-panel-kills-bills-to-ban-anti-lgbt-discrimination-in-housing-and-jobs/2018/02/08/17051270-0d15-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.cc3b3bd8324d) Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [[6]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0), explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are *already* codified as part of existing  state law. 

So as with the executive orders, I can see why the anti-LGBT discrimination portion of this proposed legislation would serve a purpose. But the parts of this legislation having to do with racial discrimination, religious discrimination, etc. seem to be redundant to existing state law.

It seems like the legislature could propose a law simply banning LGBT discrimination, rather than proposing a law that would ban, in addition to LGBT discrimination, a bunch of things that have already been banned in Virginia. 

I know that this is a really specific, wonky question, and so I'm not sure that anyone will be able to answer it. But does anyone know why -

1. Virginia governors continue to issue executive orders banning things that are already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of issuing executive orders that are solely focused on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

2. the Virginia legislature has proposed legislation that would ban things already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of proposing legislation that would solely focus on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

Is there some very subtle thing that I'm not understanding here? Or like I suggested earlier, is this simply being done for symbolic purposes? 

Thanks!","Every governor of Virginia since Linwood Holton has signed an executive order banning the state workforce from engaging in racial, religious, or sex-based discrimination.[1] Recent governors have expanded these executive orders to include further protections, some of which are not currently covered by federal or state law, such as protections on the basis of sexual orientation and on the basis of gender identity.[1][2]

I'm not familiar with how to read legal documents, but if I'm understanding this page correctly, it seems that Virginia may not have had any anti-discrimination laws until the 1980s. Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time.

But as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact?

Making matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[4][5] Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [6], explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are already codified as part of existing state law.

Julian Assange is being charged by the U.S Government under sections 793(g), 793(b), 793(c), 793(d) and 793(e) of the Espionage Act, and sections 371 and 1030 of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.3 The Justice Department national security division claims that Julian Assange ""is no journalist"" and presumably should not be subject to the same protection as a news media corporation.4

Is criminalizing the publication of secret government documents under the Espionage Act of 1917 constitutional? Did the Government achieve a sufficient level of evidence to fulfill the requirements for prior restraint?5*

What are the arguments for and against expunging marijuana convictions in legalization legislations?,408,bomcl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/bomcl1/what_are_the_arguments_for_and_against_expunging/,212,1557886007.0,"I was recently reading an article in the NYT about marijuana legalization laws hitting a wall in New York and New Jersey.

One of the points the article mentions about New Jersey, when talking about possibly reviving the legalization movement there, is that:

>...in New Jersey, the proposal’s sponsors have discussed changing the current bill, including removing an expungement provision that would have cleared convictions for people who were caught in possession of up to five pounds of marijuana.

It seems the expungement of marijuana convictions is a controversial topic when trying to pass these legislations. Looking at other states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, the topic of expungement is indeed controversial: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they\_n\_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they_n_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da)

Given what' I've read, the arguments **for** seem to relate to fairness as well as civil rights:

>“I think the simplest way of looking at it for us is just that these people have convictions that if they were to commit them today they wouldn’t be a crime,” Jiron said. “So it seems unfair to basically saddle them with a conviction for something that is now legal.” 

And on the Civil Rights front:

>The nation’s war on drugs has disproportionately harmed low-income and communities of color — blacks are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than whites, despite similar rates of use of the drug, according to the[ American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white).

On the **against** side, the article quotes this argument:

>Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.

So my questions are:

1. How do jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana address these concerns about other offenses that are not in the books?
2. Are there any other arguments for or against expunging marijuana convictions (as part of legalization efforts OR after the fact)?

Side Note: New Jersey and New York are special in this case as they are the first **states** ([some territories have](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/09/21/governor-signs-marijuana-legalization-bill-making-history-in-us-territory/#539b23f027ea))  to try to pass recreational legalization by state legislation ([https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline\_of\_cannabis\_laws\_in\_the\_United\_States#/State](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_cannabis_laws_in_the_United_States#/State)).

I make it a point to have as much academic referencing in all of my political postings online as a political candidate. I do my research and I want people to know I do my research. I have opinions, but they are based in research as much as possible.

1. Trump asked then-FBI director James Comey to “see his way to” letting former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn off the hook from criminal investigation, but Comey didn’t do it.

2. Trump told then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to call Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (then serving as acting attorney general over the Russia investigation after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself) to remove Mueller from his appointment as Special Counsel, but McGahn didn’t do it.

3. Trump told aides Corey Lewandowski and Rick Dearborn to tell Sessions to partly un-recuse himself and limit the investigation to Russian interference in future elections, not in 2016. They didn’t do it.

4. Trump attempted to influence McGahn’s testimony to Mueller’s team to keep him from speaking fully about Trump’s efforts to remove Mueller, but McGahn didn’t listen to him.

On Thursday, April 18, 2019, AG Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller Report, which redacts grand jury material, sources and methods, information relating to actual pending matters, and private info of peripheral third parties (https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/robert-mueller-report-public/index.html)

Mueller said:

>[T]he Special Counsel's investigation established that
Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a
Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence
service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers
working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also
identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although
the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit  electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not
establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
government in its election interference activities.^2

her pregnancy for health reasons lies at the core or the periphery

that a woman's freedom of choice carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices. Although government may not place obstacles in the
path of a woman's exercise of her freedom of choice, it need not remove
those not of its own creation, and indigency falls within the latter category
Although Congress has opted to subsidize medically necessary
services generally, but not certain medically necessary abortions, the fact
remains that the Hyde Amendment leaves an indigent woman with at
least the same range of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically
necessary abortion as she would have had if Congress had chosen to
subsidize no health care costs at all. Pp. 316-317

Indexing Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend,403,bb4ub9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/bb4ub9/indexing_andrew_yangs_freedom_dividend/,316,1554822369.0,"Andrew Yang's Universal Basic Income or ""Freedom Dividend"" proposal is to give $1,000 per month to every adult American who opts-in to the policy ([https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/)) (https://thinkprogress.org/andrew-yang-ubi-automation-profile-1b0957cc12b7/). Yang has stated the precise payout will eventually fluctuate by pegging the overall dollar amount to a particular resource, and he has made an express comparison to the Alaska Permanent Fund's annual individual payouts to certain Alaska state residents ([https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw?t=1478](https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw?t=1478)) (https://quillette.com/2019/03/06/in-defense-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend/).

Alaska's individual payouts are determined according to a set formula that averages the five year performance of the Alaska Permanent Fund (which is funded with a portion of state oil revenues) ([https://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-payment-fund/alaska-residents-to-receive-record-payment-from-oil-royalty-fund-idUSL1N11N03U20150917](https://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-payment-fund/alaska-residents-to-receive-record-payment-from-oil-royalty-fund-idUSL1N11N03U20150917)). Yang has indicated (in the clip above, a podcast that ran this Sunday; link is timestamped) that his UBI's individual payout amount would fluctuate with the profitability of artificial intelligence. 

Question: is it possible to treat an entire discrete industry as a resource for the sake of indexing the size and payout of a national social program to that industry's profitability? Do any other social programs in the U.S. fluctuate according to the success of a particular industry? Is the difference between oil (a commodity) and A.I. (not a commodity) relevant to the feasibility of this aspect of Yang's proposal?
