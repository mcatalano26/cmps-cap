Wall Street has been rocked by an $8 billion hedge fund's implosion,183,4op948,http://www.businessinsider.com/visium-asset-management-closure-rocks-wall-street-2016-6?&platform=bi-androidapp,10,1466297368.0,,"jake gottlieb, the founder of visium. reuters/ rick wilking visium asset management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund, has imploded in the biggest scandal to hit the industry in years.

the fund told investors of its plan to close in a letter friday. it's the most high-profile shutdown since authorities forced steve cohen's controversial sac capital to close in 2013.



a slew of factors — from a brewing insider-trading scandal to a contentious investment by visium's founder that rankled investors and staffers alike — led to visium's demise.



on top of all of that, visium's flagship fund had been reporting dismal performance. visium is selling one of its better performing funds to alliancebernstein, it said.

just days before visium announced the shut down, one of its top portfolio managers — sanjay valvani — was charged with wire and securities fraud. he is accused of using insider information from a food and drug administration official to place trades on drug companies ahead of key fda decisions from about 2005 through 2011.

two other former visium portfolio managers, christopher plaford and stefan lumiere, were accused of purposefully miscalculating the price of securities so that they could charge investors inflated fees and mislead them about the fund's liquidity.

the closure of the firm represents a remarkable turnaround: it managed about $7.8 billion firmwide at the start of the year, a 20% increase from the year before, according to hedge fund intelligence.

the investigations visium is facing would present a challenge for any firm. in a letter to investors announcing the closure, jake gottlieb, the founder of visium, wrote:

[g]iven the uncertainty relative to the final outcome of the recent regulatory developments, the negative impact of the resulting publicity, and the substantial investor withdrawals, it became clear that maintaining the status quo was increasingly untenable for the firm.

still, there are other issues at play here, too.

for one, visium's flagship fund was down 9.3% this year through may, while its competitors were up 0.2%, according to performance figures obtained by business insider. it's a dramatic drop from where the fund had performed over the last several years, beating its index from 2011 up until last year.

meanwhile, rumors about federal investigations into potential wrongdoing have been swirling for some time.

that influenced steve cohen, who was banned from managing other investors' money after his own firm's insider-trading scandal, to put a stop on hiring from visium before the investigation even became public, people familiar with the matter told business insider. authorities are lifting the ban on cohen from managing outside money in 2018.

then there are the departures and investor redemptions.

many staffers recently left and morale had dropped, according to several recruiters and former staffers. visium even stopped enforcing its noncompete agreements for some ex-employees in recent weeks. noncompete agreements are common within the finance industry and were negotiated on an individual basis at visium, former staffers and recruiters said. traditionally, visium paid former staffers a hefty salary to not work at its competitors for six to 12 months at a time.

but after the investigation into visium was announced, employees found it increasingly difficult to find new homes.

""if you got out early, you were lucky,"" one recent visium departee, who declined to be named, told business insider. ""and if you’re still there, it’s far more difficult to land somewhere else.""

then there are the ""substantial investor withdrawals"" that gottlieb referred to in his letter friday. it isn't clear exactly how much investors asked to pull from the firm, but two people familiar with the matter said the number was in excess of $3 billion.

irked investors

even before the latest problems, investors had been rankled by a trade that gottlieb placed on his own behalf, in 2014, two former employees of the fund said.

in early january of that year, visium disclosed a 5% stake in a drugmaker called intercept pharmaceuticals. a tiny portion of the stake, about 25,000 shares out of a total of a million, were bought by gottlieb himself, who is a trained physician. the regulatory filing disclosing the stake doesn't say when the shares were purchased, but on the same day as the filing, january 9, intercept's shares jumped 281% after the company said it was stopping a trial of its liver-disease drug early because it was so effective.

it’s not clear precisely what price visium and gottlieb paid, but if they acquired the shares the day before the news of the drug’s efficacy broke, by the end of january 10 the visium fund's profits could have reached $364 million, while gottlieb’s personal profits would have been about $9.6 million.

intercept had already alerted investors to the fact that it would be revealing results from the trial on that day, and it had been drawing speculation over the good news for months.

what irked visium's investors was that gottlieb had bought shares personally instead of through the fund, a violation of visium's own rules, according to two people who worked there at the time. visium explained to investors that gottlieb had been exempt from the policy at the time of the trade, one of the people said.

it also gave off the appearance that gottlieb was focusing on his profits first, creating conflicts of interest with the performance of the flagship fund.

in his letter to investors announcing the closure of the fund, gottlieb said that visium had sought to put investors first.

“as you know, since visium launched in 2005, we have sought to deliver strong risk-adjusted performance and more importantly, we’ve strived to put our investors first. i am enormously proud of visium’s long-term track record,"" the letter said.

the speed with which visium has been forced to shutter is striking. as recently as last year, an industry publication highlighted the firm for its strong performance. and in 2014, gottlieb was one of the headliners at a prominent new york hedge fund conference.

How a $2 Roadside Drug Test Sends Innocent People to Jail,91,4sef35,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/magazine/how-a-2-roadside-drug-test-sends-innocent-people-to-jail.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0,11,1468314891.0,,"field tests provide quick answers. but if those answers and confessions cannot be trusted, charles mcclelland, the former houston police chief, says, officers should not be using them. during an interview in march, mcclelland said that if he had known of the false positives houston’s officers were generating, he would have ordered a halt to all field testing departmentwide. police officers are not chemists, mcclelland said. “officers shouldn’t collect and test their own evidence, period. i don’t care whether that’s cocaine, blood, hair.”

judges, too, have the power, and a responsibility, some argue, to slow down the gears of the system. patricia lykos, the harris county district attorney from 2009 to 2013, says that when she served as a criminal-court judge in the 1980s and 1990s, she would ask the defendants questions about their lives and the crimes they were accused of committing. if she wasn’t satisfied that the defendant was guilty of the charge, lykos says, she wouldn’t accept the plea. at times the situation is even easier to decipher, says david labahn, president of the association of prosecuting attorneys. the defendant can be heard arguing his or her innocence to the appointed attorney. in such drug-possession cases, when the prosecutor doesn’t have a lab report, “if i’m that judicial officer, this case is continued” — adjourned — “until everybody can do their job,” labahn says.

but that means the defendant, depending on his or her custody status, could go back to jail until the case proceeds, presenting a significant dilemma. last year, devon anderson, the current harris county district attorney, prohibited plea deals in drug-possession cases before the lab has issued a report. the labs issue reports in about two weeks, but defendants typically wait three weeks before they can see a judge — enough time to lose a job, lose an apartment, lose everything. and yet since anderson implemented the rule, case dismissals have soared 31 percent, primarily because the lab has proved defendants not guilty.

people plead guilty when they’re innocent because they see no alternative. people who have just been arrested usually don’t know their options, or even that they have an option. “there’s a fail-safe in there, and it’s called the defense lawyer,” says rick werstein, the attorney now representing albritton as she seeks to finalize her exoneration. defense lawyers can demand a lab analysis, and they exist to help defendants navigate the consequences of the jail time while they wait, even as they explain the even higher costs of a felony conviction. they are fully authorized to pursue alternative deals.

in fact, richardson, albritton's original court-appointed lawyer, says the prosecutor offered her a deferred adjudication, in which she may have been able to wait for the results of a lab test outside the walls of a jail cell. richardson, who first said he had no memory of their conversations, says he told her about the offer but she refused it. albritton says she has never heard of anything called deferred adjudication. neither could explain what actually happened. perhaps they simply accepted that the field test, with its promise of scientific inevitability, would eventually convict her. “the entire country works on these field-test kits, right?” richardson asks.

in the past three years, people arrested based on false-positive field tests have filed civil lawsuits in sullivan county, tenn.; lehigh county, pa.; atlanta, ga.; and san diego, calif. three of the four cases also named the manufacturers safari­land group or sirchie as defendants. three of the cases have already been settled. in one of them, the sullivan county case, safariland secured a gag order on the plaintiff, explicitly to prevent media coverage, before entering settlement negotiations. the plaintiffs in each of the suits were people who were arrested, refused to plead guilty and were detained for a month or longer. so far, we have been unable find anyone who pleaded guilty based on field-test results and later filed suit, though werstein said he and albritton are considering their additional legal options.

the texas criminal court of appeals overturned albritton’s conviction in late june, but before her record can be cleared, that reversal must be finalized by the trial court in houston. felony records are digitally disseminated far and wide, and can haunt the wrongly convicted for years after they are exonerated. until the court makes its final move, amy albritton — for the purposes of employment, for the purposes of housing, for the purposes of her own peace of mind — remains a felon, one among unknown tens of thousands of americans whose lives have been torn apart by a very flawed test."
"Sessions spoke twice with Russian ambassador during Trump’s presidential campaign, Justice officials say",668,5x0k84,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.f2a14c329123,84,1488450328.0,,error
The Russia story just keeps getting worse for President Trump,90,64zsim,http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/politics/trump-carter-page-russia-devin-nunes/,31,1492048490.0,,"washington (cnn) two stories dealing with russia's meddling in the election broke tuesday night. and both were full of bad news for president donald trump.

the first, an exclusive to cnn , revealed that a number of democratic and republican lawmakers on the house and senate intelligence committees who have seen classified documents see no evidence that obama administration officials did anything unusual or illegal, further suggesting rep. devin nunes, r-california, misled trump (and the public) when he described documents relating to the unmasking of trump campaign officials caught up in an incidental collection operation by the intelligence community.

""their private assessment contradicts president donald trump's allegations that former obama national security adviser susan rice broke the law by requesting the ""unmasking"" of us individuals' identities. trump had claimed the matter was a 'massive story.'""

the second, broken by the washington post , reveals that the fbi obtained a secret foreign intelligence surveillance court court warrant in august 2016 aimed at monitoring the communications of one-time trump foreign policy adviser carter page. the key paragraph

""the fbi and the justice department obtained the warrant targeting carter page's communications after convincing a foreign intelligence surveillance court judge that there was probable cause to believe page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case russia, according to the officials.""

scroll up. read that one again. it's a ""wow."" page has denied any wrongdoing

what's become clear over the first few months of the trump white house is that we aren't in the midst of a ""he said-she said"" when it comes to the campaign's ties to russia. it's more of a ""he alleged-he said, he said, she said, he said, he said"" sort of situation.

as in, on the one hand, we have trump asserting that the whole story of russia's attempts to influence the election via connections within his campaign apparatus is ""fake news,"" and grasping at the idea that somehow, some way he will be eventually proven right in his baseless claims that then-president barack obama ordered the wiretapping of trump tower.

on the other, we have fbi director james comey, former director of national intelligence james clapper, the heads of both the house and senate intelligence committees -- both republicans -- and lots and lots of other prominent voices within the intelligence community insisting the russian investigation is entirely justified and that no evidence exists for trump's claims.

it's not a fair fight -- and shouldn't be presented as one. and that has zero to do with partisanship and everything to do with the facts as we know them.

the best path forward for president trump as it relates to russia is to pivot from his current this-is-all-fake-news stance to one in which he embraces both the congressional and justice department investigations into the russian meddling into the election. given the amount of smoke surrounding trump's campaign and russia, it's no longer really a question whether it merits an investigation into whether there's some fire at its center.

simply because that's the path trump should take, of course, doesn't mean it's the one he will choose. in fact, for someone who prides himself on zigging when everyone thinks he should zag, trump likely won't follow this path. but all that ensures is that the russia story will just keep getting worse for him and his administration."

NSA Blocks Release Of Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton Airplane Tape For 'National Security',5,6n161i,http://bigleaguepolitics.com/nsa-blocks-release-loretta-lynch-bill-clinton-airplane-tape-national-security/,17,1499976203.0,[deleted],"the national security agency (nsa) blocked the release of a purported tape of bill clinton and former attorney general loretta lynch’s private airplane talk with a rare legal justification used to protect top national security secrets.

the nsa’s block of the release of this information — citing one of president obama’s executive orders — undercuts hillary clinton’s claim that her husband and lynch had a “purely social” conversation about grandkids and golf on june 27, 2016, two weeks before lynch dropped the department of justice investigation into hillary clinton’s email scandal.

citizen researcher larry kawa is pressing the government to release the contents of a taping system that is required to have been installed on lynch’s government airplane. kawa points to the tempest system, a nato-certified system by which the nsa tracks and records sound that emanates within government structures.

“general dynamics installs the recorders in the planes,” kawa told big league politics, referring to voip recorders that he said must be installed on airplanes like the government jet used by lynch, where the conversation took place. “(lynch) could not have un-installed them if she wanted to.”

kawa’s freedom of information act (foia) request to the nsa was denied, citing national security, but the nsa did not deny that the tape exists.

“to respond to your request, nsa would have to confirm or deny the existence of intelligence records on loretta lynch,” the agency stated in its foia response on november 14, days after the election. “were we to do so in your case, we would have to do so for every other requester. this would enable, for example, a terrorist or other adversary to file a foia request with us in order to determine whether he or she was under surveillance or had evaded it. this is turn would allow that individual to better assess whether they could successfully act to damage the national security of the united states. for such reasons, we can neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of the records you requested.”

after challenging the nsa’s response, kawa received an email from the nsa foia office, stating that he was being hit with a “glomar” denial.

“our letter dated 14 november 2016 is indeed our final response to your foia request. it states that the “first exemption” of the foia authorizes, by executive order, properly classified information to be kept secret and goes on to say that the fact of existence or non-existence of intelligence records on any individual is an appropriately classified matter. the “first exemption” is often referred to as the “b(1) exemption” to which you refer,” the nsa stated.

“we also provide background information regarding the decision, as well as the specific paragraph of e.o. 13526 which authorizes the type of response, which is often called a “glomar” response. in addition, we state that the withholding of this information is also authorized by the third exemption under the foia, as the information is also protected by statute. lastly, we provide you with instructions on how to appeal this response,” the nsa stated.

executive order 13526 was signed by president barack obama on december 29, 2009."
Trump says he should not have picked Sessions as attorney general: NY Times | Reuters,258,6oftmx,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-sessions-idUSKBN1A5007,66,1500581520.0,,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday he would not have appointed jeff sessions as attorney general if he had known sessions would recuse himself from the russia investigation, according to a new york times interview.

“sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me before he took the job and i would have picked somebody else,” the times quoted trump as saying.

sessions recused himself in march from the probe into allegations of russia’s meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and possible ties between russians and the trump campaign. he did so after failing to disclose at his confirmation hearing that he had held meetings last year with russia’s ambassador.

a sessions spokesman declined a reuters request for comment.

there were media reports last month that sessions, a former u.s. senator who was an early supporter of trump’s campaign, had offered to resign because of tensions with trump over the recusal.

trump also told the new york times that a conversation he had with russian president vladimir putin during a dinner at the group of 20 summit in germany earlier this month lasted about 15 minutes and was mostly about “pleasantries.” that conversation has sparked controversy because it was only disclosed on tuesday.

ian bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy eurasia group, has said the meeting lasted about an hour."
"Labor Union Approval Best Since 2003, at 61%",51,6xapy0,http://www.gallup.com/poll/217331/labor-union-approval-best-2003.aspx,2,1504251300.0,,"story highlights high union approval still not as high as in the 1930s to 1960s

new high of 39% of americans say unions should have greater influence

46% believe unions will be weaker in the future

washington, d.c. -- in the u.s., 61% of adults say they approve of labor unions, the highest percentage since the 65% approval recorded in 2003. the current labor union approval is up five percentage points from last year and is 13 points above the all-time low found in 2009.

unions have regained popularity since bottoming out at the beginning of the obama administration in 2009. that survey marked the first and only time in gallup's trend dating back to 1936 that support for unions was below 50%.

historically, unions have enjoyed strong support from the american public. in 1936, 72% of americans approved of labor unions. union approval peaked in the 1950s when it reached 75% in 1953 and 1957. approval remained in the 60% range throughout the 2000s, right up to the election of barack obama as president. after plummeting in 2009, union approval remained lower than in its heyday but began climbing.

democrats twice as likely as republicans to approve unions

eighty-one percent of democrats approve of unions this year -- significantly higher than the 42% of republicans who approve. this disparity is not as stark as it was in 2011 when republican approval was 26% and democratic approval was 78%. democratic approval of unions has been fairly steady over time, while the approval levels of independents and republicans have fluctuated.

republicans' approval of unions rose since last year, possibly due to the presidency of republican donald trump. even though trump is not an avid supporter of unions, his rhetoric about restoring u.s. manufacturing jobs and cordial relations with some top labor union leaders at the start of his term may have softened republican attitudes about unions.

republican approval of unions is similar to when the last republican president, george w. bush, left office. it is possible that republicans may now perceive unions as less threatening because trump is unlikely to expand their power.

more americans would like to see labor unions have greater influence

as more u.s. adults approve of unions, their interest in wanting unions to have more influence is also on the rise. thirty-nine percent of americans would like unions to have more influence -- the highest figure recorded in the 18 years gallup has asked this question.

consequently, those who want labor unions to have less influence is at a record low of 28%. thirty percent want unions to have the same influence as today.

the ""influence"" response mirrors the ""approval"" response in that the more americans approve of unions, the more they want them to have greater influence. when support for unions dipped in the late 2000s and early 2010s, so too did the idea of unions having more influence.

still, americans remain more pessimistic than optimistic about unions' future. forty-six percent say they think unions will become weaker than they are today, while 27% say they will be the same and 22% say stronger.

bottom line

for the past 80 years, unions have been an integral part of the american labor force. since 1936, shortly after congress legalized private sector unions and collective bargaining, u.s. adults have approved -- sometimes overwhelmingly -- of labor unions. this trend has endured despite a historical decrease in union membership; gallup's latest survey shows that 10% of americans report personally being a union member, while 16% live in a union household.

unions have regained the approval of the american people after dropping during the great recession. as more time passes since the bailout of two of the big three auto companies, a possible reason unions dipped in approval, it appears that unions are once again solidly popular.

there are likely limits to this approval, however. republicans' lower approval of unions, as part of a growing political polarization on a number of issues, means that solid union support may never return to the levels seen from the 1930s to 1960s.

How Fake News Turned a Small Town Upside Down - NYTimes.com,150,7307wv,https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/magazine/how-fake-news-turned-a-small-town-upside-down.html?referer=android-app://com.andrewshu.android.reddit,16,1506635679.0,,"as the only city of any size for 100 miles in any direction, twin falls serves as a modest hub within southern idaho’s vast agricultural sprawl. its population of about 45,000 nearly doubles each day as people travel there to work, primarily in the thriving agribusinesses. but its bucolic rhythms still allow for children to play outside unattended and make driving a meditative experience. surrounding the city and sprinkled among its tidy tract neighborhoods, potatoes, alfalfa, sugar beets and corn grow in fields. half a million dairy cows in the area produce three-quarters of the state’s milk supply. because of its location, twin falls is home to major food processors like chobani yogurt, clif bar and glanbia nutritionals, a dairy company. all have large facilities in town and have helped to push down the unemployment rate to just under 3 percent, below the national average. the wealth of easy-to-find low-skilled jobs made twin falls attractive as a place for resettling refugees, and they began arriving in the 1980s, at that time mostly from cambodia and the former yugoslavia. nearly 2,500 refugees have moved to the town over the years.

most twin falls residents are churchgoing, and about half of those are mormons. locally owned stores and restaurants are generally closed on sundays, and the city has not voted for a democratic presidential candidate since franklin delano roosevelt in 1936. liberals often register as republicans just to have an opportunity to participate in the electoral process, by voting in the primaries. if a republican is going to win regardless, the thinking goes, they would at least like to play a role in deciding which one prevails.

the same qualities that bind the townspeople together can, in turn, be alienating to newcomers. the refugee community has begun to experience this effect as its demographic makeup has changed. over the past decade and a half, as conflict spread across north africa and the middle east, twin falls started to resettle larger numbers of refugees with darker skin who follow an unfamiliar religion — two things that make it difficult to blend into a town that is 80 percent white.

on a national scale, an ascendant network of anti-muslim activists and provocateurs has exploited the fears brought on by these changes, finding a platform and a receptive audience online. the narrative they espouse — on blogs with names like jihad watch — is that america, currently 1 percent muslim, is in the midst of an islamic invasion. central to the worldview of these bloggers, some of whom have celebrity-size social-media followings, is that muslims have a propensity toward sexual violence. they seize on any news item that bolsters this notion. perhaps their biggest touchstone is an incident that took place in cologne, germany, on new year’s eve in 2015. mobs of men, many of them asylum seekers from the middle east, pick-pocketed and groped more than a thousand women in and around a train station. the german police acknowledged the incident had taken place only under pressure, as the women’s stories began to leak out through the media. this established, for these activists, the contours of a narrative that they believe has been repeating itself. the fawnbrook incident quickly drew their interest.

what happened in twin falls was sadly somewhat commonplace but not in the way the activists believed. the local police department investigates sex crimes on a weekly basis, and in about half a dozen of those that proceed to court each year, the victims and the accused are both minors. “if it’s younger kids, it’s them being curious,” j.r. paredez, the lead investigator on the case, explained to me. some children who act out sexually have been victimized themselves, he said, while others have been exposed to explicit material at home or at school or, as is more common recently, on their cellphones. “as they start to get older, there’s more of the actual sexual component to it.”

two weeks after the incident, the boys were charged with lewd and lascivious behavior against a minor. (the 14-year-old who lent his cellphone to the boys was initially charged with the same crime. he was not present in the laundry room, and his charge was eventually reduced to make him an accessory.) in idaho, this statute applies to physical contact “done with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person, such minor child, or third party.” paredez said that the cellphone video made clear what specifically had happened between the children, but that he couldn’t show it to the reporters who asked him about it, because doing so would have constituted criminal distribution of child pornography. he called most of the details that he read about the case on the internet “100 percent false, like not even close to being accurate.” (the family of the accused declined to comment.)

as more time passed without a solid account of what happened inside the laundry room, lurid rumors continued to surface online and came to dominate conversations in grocery stores and at school events. and while the city council members did not have control over the case, the bloggers who wrote about it placed much of the blame on them."
Islamic State defeated in its Syrian capital Raqqa,327,76z4xh,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa/islamic-state-defeated-in-its-syrian-capital-raqqa-idUSKBN1CM0VC,6,1508281817.0,,"raqqa, syria (reuters) - u.s.-backed militias in syria declared victory over islamic state in its capital raqqa on tuesday, raising flags over the last jihadist footholds after a four-month battle.

the fighting was over and the alliance of kurdish and arab militias was clearing the city’s stadium of mines and any remaining militants, said rojda felat, commander of the raqqa campaign for the syrian democratic forces (sdf).

a formal declaration of victory in raqqa will soon be made, once the city has been cleared of mines and any possible islamic state sleeper cells, said sdf spokesman talal selo.

in washington, the u.s. military said that about 90 percent of raqqa had been retaken from islamic state but it expected the sdf to face pockets of resistance.

the fall of raqqa, where islamic state staged euphoric parades after its string of lightning victories in 2014, is a potent symbol of the jihadist movement’s collapsing fortunes.

islamic state has lost much of its territory in syria and iraq this year, including its most prized possession, mosul. in syria, it has been forced back into a strip of the euphrates valley and surrounding desert.

the sdf, backed by a u.s.-led international alliance, has been fighting since june to take the city which islamic state used to plan attacks abroad.

a reuters witness said militia fighters celebrated in the streets, chanting slogans from their vehicles.

the fighters and commanders clasped their arms round each other, smiling, in a battle-scarred landscape of rubble and ruined buildings around the main square.

the flags in the stadium and others waved in the city streets were of the sdf, its strongest militia the kurdish ypg, and the ypg’s female counterpart, the ypj.

fighters hauled down the black flag of islamic state, the last still flying over the city, from the national hospital near the stadium.

“we do still know there are still ieds (improvised explosive devices) and booby traps in and amongst the areas that isis once held, so the sdf will continue to clear deliberately through areas,” said colonel ryan dillon, a spokesman for the coalition.

in a sign that the four-month battle for raqqa had been in its last stages, dillon said there were no coalition air strikes there on monday.

speaking with reporters in washington later on monday via video conference, dillon said about 100 islamic state fighters still remained in raqqa.

“we expect our syrian democratic force partners to hit pockets of resistance as the final parts of the city (are) cleared,” dillon added.

trapped by fighting

fatima hussein, a 58-year-old woman sitting on a pavement smoking a cigarette, said she had emerged from her house after being trapped for months by the fighting. islamic state had killed her son for helping civilians leave the city, she said.

the fight for raqqa has shattered much of the city. houses, apartment blocks and public buildings were flattened by air strikes or holed by shellfire.

on tuesday the international charity save the children said many of the 270,000 people who fled the fighting would likely be stuck in aid camps for months or years.

children who fled were haunted by nightmares from the violence they witnessed, including islamic state beheadings and coalition air strikes, it said.

the sdf has said that after the raqqa battle ends, it would hand over control to a civil council set up by its political allies. it echoes the pattern in other territory the ypg and its allies have taken across northern syria.

the state department said the united states would help clear rubble and restore basic services in raqqa.

“we will assist and take, essentially, the lead in bringing back the water, electricity and all of that,” state department spokeswoman heather nauert told a briefing. “but eventually the governance of the country of syria is something that i think all nations remain very interested in.”

kurdish influence in the future of the mainly arab city has been a sensitive issue for some activists from raqqa and for turkey. ankara views the ypg militia as an extension of the pkk that has waged an insurgency on turkish soil for three decades.

the sdf took the national hospital after fierce fighting overnight and early on tuesday, said spokesman mostafa bali.

“during these clashes, the national hospital was liberated and cleared from the daesh mercenaries, and 22 of these foreign mercenaries were killed there,” said bali, using the arabic acronym for islamic state.

an sdf field commander who gave his name as ager ozalp said three militiamen had been killed on monday by mines that have become an islamic state trademark in its urban battles.

another field commander, who gave his name as abjal al-syriani, said sdf fighters had found burned weapons and documents in the stadium.

the stadium and hospital became the last major positions held by islamic state after some of its fighters quit, leaving only foreign jihadists to mount a last stand.

the sdf has been supported by a u.s.-led international coalition with air strikes and special forces on the ground since it started the battle for raqqa city in early june.

the final sdf assault began on sunday after a group of syrian jihadists evacuated the city under a deal with tribal elders, leaving only a hard core of up to 300 fighters to defend the last positions.

passports and money

raqqa was the first big city islamic state captured in early 2014, before its series of rapid victories in iraq and syria brought millions of people under the rule of its self-declared caliphate, which passed laws and issued passports and money.

it used the city as a planning and operations center for its warfare in the middle east and its string of attacks overseas, and for a time imprisoned western hostages there before killing them in slickly produced films distributed online.

the sdf advance since sunday also brought it control over the central city public square, where islamic state once displayed the severed heads of its enemies, and which became one of its last lines of defense as the battle progressed.

the offensive has pushed islamic state from most of northern syria, while a rival offensive by the syrian army, backed by russia, iran and shi’ite militias, has driven the jihadists from the central desert.

on tuesday, a military media unit run by lebanon’s hezbollah said the syrian army, which hezbollah fights with, had pushed into the last islamic state districts of deir al-zor city.

the only populated areas the jihadist group still controls in syria are the towns and villages downstream of deir al-zor city along the euphrates valley, areas that for the past three years islamic state ran from raqqa."
Supreme Court appears split in fight over cake for gay wedding,36,7ht8tj,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/05/gay-wedding-cake-supreme-court-280944,27,1512540526.0,,"people gather outside the supreme court before masterpiece cakeshop vs. colorado civil rights commission is heard tuesday. | brendan smialowski/afp/getty images supreme court appears split in fight over cake for gay wedding colorado bakeshop owner claims anti-discrimination law intrudes on his free expression rights.

a christian baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple found unexpected traction for his position at the supreme court tuesday, as the justices wrestled with a high-profile clash between religious beliefs and anti-discrimination laws.

the high court's champion of gay rights, justice anthony kennedy, seemed troubled by colorado officials' treatment of masterpiece cakeshop owner jack phillips after he turned down charlie craig and david mullins' request for a custom cake to celebrate their wedding in 2012.

""tolerance is essential in a free society. tolerance is most meaningful when it's mutual,"" kennedy said during oral arguments that were scheduled for an hour but stretched to nearly an hour and a half. ""it seems to me the state in its position has been neither tolerant nor respectful of mr. phillips' religious beliefs.""

kennedy dismissed as ""too facile"" a lawyer's arguments that phillips had discriminated against the gay couple based on their identity. and the reagan appointee and frequent swing justice suggested colorado went too far in ordering phillips to implement remedial training for his workers.

""he has to teach that to his family. he has to speak about that to his family,"" kennedy said.

however, kennedy also expressed concern for the plight of gay couples who might be refused services, and he asked a trump administration lawyer if the federal government ""would feel vindicated"" if a widespread movement developed to deny cakes to same-sex couples.

“if you prevail, could the baker put a sign in his window, we do not bake cakes for gay weddings?” kennedy asked solicitor general noel francisco. “and you would not think that an affront to the gay community?”

“i would not minimize the dignity interests to mr. craig and mr. mullins one bit, but there are dignity interests on the other side here too,” replied francisco, who argued in favor of the baker.

beyond kennedy, the court seemed to divide along the usual ideological lines, with liberals speculating about the damage a ruling for the baker could do to laws against racial, gender and religious discrimination, while conservatives expressed worries about intruding on deeply held religious beliefs.

liberal justices warned that allowing a cake-maker to avoid anti-discrimination laws would lead to photographers, jewelers, tailors and caterers seeking to level the same claims.

phillips' attorney, kristen waggoner of the alliance defense fund, called phillips' work a ""temporary sculpture"" and said concerns about other vendors trying to avoid serving gay couples were exaggerated.

""the tailor is not engaged in speech, nor is the chef,"" she said.

""woah, the baker is engaged in speech, but the chef is not engaged in speech?"" justice elena kagan replied incredulously.

even someone doing makeup might decline to take part in a wedding on grounds they're expressing their creativity, kagan noted.

“it’s called an artist. it's the makeup artist,” she noted, to laughter from many in the courtroom. ""a makeup artist, i think, might feel exactly as your client does, that they're doing something that's of great aesthetic importance to the wedding.""

justice sonia sotomayor noted that a major sandwich chain suggests its employees are deeply creative. ""there are sandwich artists now,"" she observed.

noting that “the primary purpose of food is to be eaten,” sotomayor proposed a kind of functional test, where objects to be used or consumed wouldn’t be considered expressive enough to warrant first amendment protection.

but justice samuel alito noted that buildings are intended to be used and lived in, although “architectural design” surely has a large creative element to it.

alito seemed to think waggoner would embrace that idea, but she quickly rejected it, perhaps out of concern that allowing protection for architects could be seen as countenancing housing discrimination.

""generally that would not be protected because buildings are functionable, not communicative,"" waggoner declared.

justice stephen breyer took that as an opening.

""so, in other words, mies or michelangelo or someone is not protected when he creates the laurentian steps, but this cake baker is protected when he creates the cake without any message on it for a wedding? now, that really does baffle me, i have to say,"" breyer said.

liberals had a similar moment as justice ruth bader ginsburg asked the gay couple’s attorney, david cole of the aclu, whether phillips could be compelled to decorate a cake with the phrase “god bless...” and the names of a same-sex couple if he offered a similar cake to a heterosexual couple.

cole said phillips would be obliged to do it, if the only difference were the names.

at that point, kagan jumped in. “do we have to answer that question, mr. cole?” she asked. she seemed concerned that such a direct command to the baker to write something he disagrees with would be seen by a majority of the court as unconstitutionally compelling speech.

cole noted that the gay couple in the present case never asked for a specific message, but was declined service based solely on who they were.

at the conclusion of tuesday's arguments, it seemed likely that phillips would receive some relief from the justices, though it was unclear whether it would be the sweeping ruling some social conservatives were seeking to give robust protections to businesses run by religious individuals.

one possibility appeared to be that the court would condemn aspects of how phillips was treated by the colorado civil rights commission and send the case back down to lower courts for reconsideration.

kennedy noted that a member of the commission debating phillips' case described as ""despicable"" the fact that freedom of religion is sometimes used to justify discrimination. justice neil gorsuch also expressed concern that another commissioner said that someone whose ""personal belief system"" is at odds with the law needs to change their beliefs.

while a majority of the court may be troubled by those statements, not all justices appeared to be. sotomayor said a degree of social coercion flowing from anti-discrimination law isn't a bad thing.

""america's reaction to mixed marriages and to race didn't change on its own,"" she said. ""it changed because we had public accommodation laws that forced people to do things that many claimed were against their expressive rights and against their religious rights.""

phillips says his policies for his bakery arise from sincerely held religious beliefs that also lead him to decline to make halloween cakes, as well as cakes with anti-american or sex-related themes or cakes containing alcohol.

activists and lawyers backing the couple say the courts resolved the core issue in the case about half a century ago, turning down claims by white business owners in the south that their religious beliefs entitled them to refuse to serve african-american customers.

while phillips' case has become a cause celebre for conservative christian activists nationwide, his lawyers and others taking his side in the dispute, including the trump administration, have largely focused their arguments on free speech rights. the core claim in the case is that phillips is essentially being compelled to create expression he does not wish to produce, violating his first amendment right to free speech.

the intrusion on his religious freedom has taken a back seat in the legal arguments, perhaps as a strategy aimed at winning over kennedy, who is seen as the likely swing justice in the case.

those backing the couple say that the free-speech claim is a warmed-over version of an issue raised back in 1964 by maurice bessinger, the owner of a columbia, south carolina, barbecue stand called piggie park. he defied federal civil rights laws by claiming he had a first amendment right to his anti-integration beliefs. courts rejected his contention, with the supreme court calling his claims ""patently frivolous"" in a brief 1968 ruling.

some who side with the baker in the current case, including the trump administration, have argued that the government's interest in preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation isn't as strong as it is with race.

justice ruth bader ginsburg, who was a leading women's rights advocate before taking the bench, asked noel francisco how the courts should differentiate between various anti-discrimination protections.

""i think pretty much everything but race would fall in the same category,"" francisco said in his first argument to the court since being sworn in several months ago.

cole disagreed. ""to do that would be to consign gay and lesbian people to second class status,"" he said. the aclu lawyer said francisco and the trump administration were seeking to put race in a separate category because they recognized the ""unacceptable consequences"" of allowing individual beliefs to override anti-discrimination laws created to protect african americans.

the wedding cake case is the court’s first significant foray into the issue of gay rights since the landmark 2015 ruling that the constitution requires states to recognize same-sex marriage.

the dissenters in that case warned that the decision guaranteeing gay-marriage rights would trigger a wave of litigation from religious individuals and organizations resisting efforts to force them to provide services to same-sex couples.

7th accuser comes forward. Former democratic aide says Al Franken tried to forcibly kiss her after radio show in 2006,310,7hyg56,https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/06/al-franken-accusation-sexual-harassment-2006-281049,80,1512600092.0,[deleted],"sen. al franken is one of several lawmakers and candidates facing sexual harassment allegations, amid a national outcry over misconduct that has roiled hollywood, media and politics. | alex brandon/ap photo another woman says franken tried to forcibly kiss her the minnesota senator is accused of making an unwanted sexual advance after a taping of his radio show in 2006. he denies the allegation.

a former democratic congressional aide said al franken tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006, three years before he became a u.s. senator.

the aide, whose name politico is withholding to protect her identity, said franken (d-minn.) pursued her after her boss had left the studio. she said she was gathering her belongings to follow her boss out of the room. when she turned around, franken was in her face.

the former staffer said she ducked to avoid franken’s lips. as she hastily left the room, she said, franken told her: “it’s my right as an entertainer.”

“he was between me and the door, and he was coming at me to kiss me. it was very quick, and i think my brain had to work really hard to be like ‘wait, what is happening?’ but i knew whatever was happening was not right, and i ducked,” the former aide said in an interview. “i was really startled by it, and i just sort of booked it towards the door, and he said, ‘it’s my right as an entertainer.’”

the former staffer, who was in her mid-20s at the time of the incident, said she did not respond to franken.

the woman said she had never met franken prior to the incident. franken was elected to the senate in 2008 but began ramping up his political activity in 2006.

franken, who has been accused by six other women of groping or trying to forcibly kiss them, denied the accusation.

“this allegation is categorically not true and the idea that i would claim this as my right as an entertainer is preposterous. i look forward to fully cooperating with the ongoing ethics committee investigation,” franken said in a statement to politico.

two former colleagues of the woman independently corroborated her version of events, including franken telling her he had the right to try to kiss her because he was “an entertainer.” the first former colleague interviewed by politico said she was told of the incident in 2006, shortly after it happened. the second former co-worker said she was made aware of the encounter sometime in 2009 or 2010.

hours after this story was published wednesday, more than a dozen democratic senators, led by sen. kirsten gillibrand of new york, called on franken to resign.

""while senator franken is entitled to have the ethics committee conclude its review, i believe it would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn’t acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve,"" gillibrand said in a facebook post. she was referring to a senate ethics committee investigation of the sexual harassment claims against franken.

franken will be making an announcement on thursday, his office said after the first wave of senators called for him to step down. franken's office did not provide information about the announcement, saying only ""more details to come.""

franken is one of several lawmakers and candidates facing sexual harassment allegations, amid a national outcry over misconduct that has roiled hollywood, media and politics. on tuesday, rep. john conyers (d-mich.) resigned after multiple former female aides accused him of harassing them.

conyers, the longest-serving member of the house, faced a drumbeat of demands from top democrats to step down. before wednesday, no senate democrats had called on franken to resign, but a smattering of house democrats had done so.

the former congressional aide, a longtime democrat, said she is not attempting to force franken out of office by coming forward now. her aim is to encourage the former comedian to acknowledge that his behavior toward her and other women was intentional.

“his resignation is not the top of the list there. that’s not my point. it’s not up to me what he does,” the former staffer said.

franken has said he was “ashamed” about the prior reported incidents but has also said through a spokesperson that he “never intentionally engaged in that kind of conduct.”

the former staffer said a more direct statement of culpability — not just differing recollections of events, as franken has offered in apologizing to other women — could help shift the national conversation about sexual assault and push harassers to take ownership of their behavior.

“i don’t want to be in the position of deciding whether to tell this story, but i’m not the person who put me in that position. he did that,” the woman said. “i think for this moment in time to lead to meaningful change there has to be more than ‘i’m ashamed but i remember things differently’ accounting.”

the former staffer said she mostly kept the encounter to herself, not even telling her boss at the time. but she started to talk more openly about it to close friends after the “access hollywood” video featuring donald trump was aired in october 2016. in the now infamous tape, trump is heard saying his fame gives him carte blanche to grab women’s genitals.

“when it really started impacting me in more of a ‘i’m really angry about about this’ way was last fall, when the trump tape came out,” the former aide said. “hearing donald trump say essentially the same thing that al franken said to me, which was ‘it’s my right as an entertainer,’ that was a real trigger,” she continued.

the former staffer said she was particularly shaken after seeing franken on tv responding to the trump tape last year. franken dismissed trump’s excuse that he was just engaging in “locker room talk” and joked that maybe trump worked out with roger ailes, the now deceased fox news chairman who was forced to resign in 2016 amid allegations he sexually harassed several fox employees.

“it was a moment in time where i told a number of my friends about my experience with franken because i saw him on the news being asked about the trump tape and i felt like it was really hypocritical,” the former staffer said. “it’s a power dynamic, and the fact that donald trump could say that was not much different from the fact that al franken could say it.”

franken took pains to separate himself from trump earlier this year before he was accused of sexual harassment, saying that just because the two were “both in a branch of show business” is no reason to lump them in the same category politically.

“i consider myself a polar opposite of him, i mean, i really do,” franken said on cnbc of trump in september, two months before the first sexual harassment allegations against the minnesota democrat surfaced.

franken has agreed to cooperate with the ethics committee investigation into his behavior.

“i do feel this very heavy responsibility to speak the truth,” the former staffer said. “i don’t think that there are different versions of truth, and that’s what’s bothered me a lot about [his] responses.”

Mass Shootings are a Bad Way to Understand Gun Violence - 538,315,7z5dyt,https://www.google.ie/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/mass-shootings-are-a-bad-way-to-understand-gun-violence/amp/,90,1519247179.0,[deleted],"it’s impossible to say when the first mass shooting in america took place. plant your shovel in the internet and you’ll find one event described that way, and then another. deeper and deeper. back and back. the 13 residents of camden, new jersey, killed by a neighbor in 1949. the eight winfield, kansas, concertgoers murdered when a man fired into a crowded intersection in 1903. the 60 to 150 african-americans shot and hanged by a mob of white men in colfax, louisiana, in 1873.

there is something distinctly american about this way of death. mass shootings happen in other countries, but they are far more common here. between 1966 and 2012, there were 90 such incidents in the u.s. the next four countries with the most mass shootings had 54 combined. there is also something distinctly american about how we respond to these events, the way they become tangled up in the national debate about guns — this question of how to reduce deaths attributable to a weapon protected in the founding documents of our land. no other country has that particular challenge. so mass shootings become a symbol of gun violence in general. the deaths of dozens become a window into the death of one, and a separate one, and a different one over there.

this, of course, happened with the mass shooting in las vegas that left at least 58 people dead and hundreds more injured.

and this is a problem. what we know about mass shootings suggests that they are different from the everyday deaths that happen at the end of a gun. the weapon is the same. so much else is different. and the distorted image we get by using one as a lens through which to view the other has consequences for our understanding of the problem and the policies that might address it.

last year, we produced a series of stories on american gun deaths and the people behind the statistics. from that reporting, and other sources, we know mass shootings are different from other kinds of gun deaths in several ways.

first, they’re rare, and the people doing the shooting are different. the majority of gun deaths in america aren’t even homicides, let alone caused by mass shootings. two-thirds of the more than 33,000 gun deaths that take place in the u.s. every year are suicides (click through the graphic below to see how gun deaths break down):

and while people who commit suicide and people who commit mass shootings both tend to be white and male, suicide victims tend to be older. the median age of a mass shooter, according to one report, is 34, with very few over 50. suicide, however, plagues the elderly as much as it does the middle-aged.

second, the people killed in mass shootings are different from the majority of homicides. most gun murder victims are men between the ages of 15 and 34. sixty-six percent are black. women — of any race and any age — are far less likely to be murdered by a gun. unless that gun is part of a mass shooting. there, 50 percent of the people who die are women. and at least 54 percent of mass shootings involve domestic or family violence — with the perpetrator shooting a current or former partner or a relative.

the historical trends for different kinds of gun deaths don’t all follow the same course. while data suggests that the number of mass shootings similar to the las vegas event has gone up, particularly since 2000, homicide rates have fallen significantly from their 1980 peak and continued on a generally downward trajectory for most of the 21st century. meanwhile, suicides are way up, with the biggest increases among women. the trends are different because the situations are different and the people are different. maybe different solutions are warranted, as well.

you could, theoretically, cut down on all these deaths with a blanket removal of guns from the u.s. entirely — something that is as politically unlikely as it is legally untenable. barring that, though, policies aimed at reducing gun deaths will likely need to be targeted at the specific people who commit or are victimized by those incidents. and mass shootings just aren’t a good proxy for the diversity of gun violence. policies that reduce the number of homicides among young black men — such as programs that build trust between community members, police and at-risk youth and offer people a way out of crime — probably won’t have the same effect on suicides among elderly white men. background checks and laws aimed at preventing a young white man with a history of domestic violence from obtaining a gun and using it in a mass shooting might not prevent a similar shooting by an older white male with no criminal record.

if we focus on mass shootings as a means of understanding how to reduce the number of people killed by guns in this country, we’re likely to implement laws that don’t do what we want them to do — and miss opportunities to make changes that really work. gun violence isn’t one problem, it’s many. and it probably won’t have a single solution, either.

china’s official news agency, xinhua, announced the dramatic news on sunday in a bland 36-word dispatch. it paves the way for xi to remain in power well into the next decade and perhaps even beyond.

the report said the communist party’s 205-member central committee had proposed china’s constitution be modified so that it no longer contained a section stipulating that the president and vice-president “shall serve no more than two consecutive [five-year] terms”.



jude blanchette, an expert in chinese politics from new york’s conference board research group, said: “it’s amazing. i just did not think this was possible. i just thought it was way too aggressive and bold [a move] and unnecessarily so.

“it’s an unequivocal signal that xi jinping has designs to stay on past 2023. i don’t think there is any other way to read it other than the four-decade long project that deng xiaoping initiated to set hard term limits on power to make sure that a mao figure never came back is being dismantled.

“you just need to look a few thousand miles to the west in russia to see what this potentially looks like.”

bill bishop, the publisher of the sinocism newsletter on chinese politics, said: “this is putin-plus.

“it means that so long as xi is alive and the communist party of china is in power then xi is going to be the most powerful man in china. and unlike mao he is going to be the most powerful man at a time when china is at its most powerful point in several hundred years and is only getting more powerful.”

steve tsang, the director of the soas china institute, said: “it means what it says on the tin. it’s now official that he’s not going to stand down … welcome to xi jinping’s brave new era.

“the message [from xi] is: ‘i can do it, i will do it, don’t even think about challenging it!’”



the growing supremacy of xi, 64, who took power in late 2012, was underlined in a second xinhua report that announced a body of political philosophy bearing his name, xi jinping thought, would also be written into china’s constitution. the philosophy was added to the communist party’s charter last october, a move experts said effectively anointed xi as china’s most powerful leader since mao, who ruled between 1949 and his death in 1976.

blanchette said it was impossible to see the central committee’s proposal not being green-lit by china’s parliament, the national people’s congress, when it convened early next month. “i think that’s about as likely as me winning an olympic gold medal,” blanchette said.

however, xi faced an extraordinarily complex set of domestic and international challenges, including increasingly fraught us-china relations, the north korean crisis and china’s own economic situation.

“it’s still premature to say xi jinping has become some sun god emperor who will stay on for life, because a lot of that depends on what china looks like in 2020 and 2021,” blanchette said.



“but i think barring anything catastrophic ... i think it’s a pretty good bet to say that xi jinping is going to be the dominant force in chinese politics for at least the next decade.”



joshua wong, the hong kong pro-democracy leader, said the news confirmed the onset of “the era of emperor xi”.



tsang predicted that xi would now remain in power “for as long as he wants to or feels he needs to”. “as long as he enjoys sufficiently good health he will stay on.”"

so, how does amazon go work? consumers use the amazon go app to enter the store, take the products they want and walk out. no checkout. no lines.

the store’s technology uses computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning to automatically detect when products are taken or returned to the shelves and keep track of them in a virtual cart. customers grab their items and go, and then their amazon account is charged with the bill. the store will offer ready-to-go meals, grocery essentials and even locally made food.

Justice Gorsuch Joins Supreme Court’s Liberals to Strike Down Deportation Law,295,8d0t2m,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/us/politics/supreme-court-deportations-trump.html,48,1524034146.0,,"washington — the supreme court on tuesday struck down a law that allowed the government to deport some immigrants who commit serious crimes, saying it was unconstitutionally vague. the decision will limit the trump administration’s efforts to deport people convicted of some kinds of crimes.

the vote was 5 to 4, with justice neil m. gorsuch joining the court’s four more liberal members to form a bare majority, which was a first. justice gorsuch wrote that the law crossed a constitutional line.

“vague laws,” he wrote in a concurring opinion, “invite arbitrary power.”

justice gorsuch had voted with the court’s conservative majority in february in a different immigration case, one that ruled that people held in immigration detention, sometimes for years, are not entitled to periodic hearings to decide whether they may be released on bail.

his vote in tuesday’s case was not entirely surprising, though, as he has a skepticism of vague laws that do not give people affected by them adequate notice of what they prohibit."

Trump Withdraws U.S. From ‘One-Sided’ Iran Nuclear Deal,188,8hz10r,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html,102,1525832780.0,,"months of intense negotiations with the europeans to keep the accord in place collapsed over mr. trump’s insistence that the limits placed by the agreement on iran’s nuclear fuel production were inadequate. under the provisions of the deal, those limits, or “sunset clauses,” were to expire in 2030 — 15 years after the deal was signed.

as a result, the united states will reinstate all the sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord, and it will impose additional economic penalties that are now being drawn up by the treasury department.

treasury secretary steven mnuchin declined on tuesday to specify what additional sanctions the united states might impose, but he expressed confidence that they would still be powerful even if other american allies did not follow suit.

“we do not want to let iran use the u.s. financial markets and financial system and transact in dollars until they agree that not only will they not have a nuclear weapon now, but we’ve put in provisions that they will never have one,” mr. mnuchin said.

in his announcement, mr. trump recited familiar arguments against the deal: that it does not address the threat of iran’s ballistic missiles or its malign behavior in the region, and that the expiration dates for the sunset clauses open the door to an iranian nuclear bomb down the road.

even if iran was in compliance, he said, it could “still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.” in fact, under the deal, the limits on iran’s uranium enrichment and stockpiles of nuclear fuel mean that iran would not be on the verge of a nuclear breakout until 2030.

still, mr. trump said, the united states and its allies could not stop iran from building a nuclear weapon “under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.”"
Justice Anthony Kennedy to retire from Supreme Court,343,8uby76,https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/27/politics/anthony-kennedy-retires/index.html,95,1530152056.0,,"washington (cnn) justice anthony kennedy , a conservative who provided key votes for same sex-marriage, abortion access and affirmative action, will retire from the supreme court.

the retirement is effective july 31, kennedy said in a letter to president donald trump on wednesday.

kennedy's decision to step down could transform the supreme court for generations. trump will have his second opportunity to nominate a justice and will likely replace kennedy with a young, conservative jurist. that would create a bloc of five staunch conservative justices who could move the court further to the right and cement a conservative majority for the foreseeable future.

the nomination battle will likely ignite a firestorm on capitol hill as it comes just a year after republicans changed the rules of the senate in order to push through the nomination of justice neil gorsuch, trump's first nominee.

trump said he has held kennedy in high esteem, and that a search for a replacement will begin immediately.

""he's been a great justice of the supreme court,"" trump said, later adding, ""he is a man who's displayed great vision, he's displayed tremendous vision.""

trump and kennedy met shortly before the announcement was made.

""(we) had a very deep discussion. i got his ideas on things,"" trump said in the oval office. ""i asked him if he had certain people he had great respect for that could potentially take his seat.""

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who blocked president barack obama's nomination of merrick garland in 2016 until the presidential election was held, paving the way for gorsuch, said the senate will move quickly.

""we will vote to confirm justice kennedy's successor this fall,"" mcconnell said wednesday.

the court opening is also likely to drastically alter both parties' approaches to november's midterm elections. republicans, in particular, hope the vacancy activates a base that the party has worried would sit out this year's contests.

the timing couldn't be worse for the five democratic senators up for re-election in states trump won by double digits: sens. joe donnelly of indiana, claire mccaskill of missouri, jon tester of montana, heidi heitkamp of north dakota and joe manchin of west virginia. if those five vote against trump's nominee, they'll hand republicans a potent issue to hammer them with. if they vote for the nominee, they risk severe retribution from within the democratic party.

recalling mcconnell's action, democrats have begun calling for a delay until after the midterms.

""sen. mcconnell set the new standard by giving the american people their say in the upcoming election before court vacancies are filled,"" said illinois democratic sen. dick durbin. ""with so much at stake for the people of our country, the us senate must be consistent and consider the president's nominee once the new congress is seated in january.""

""millions of people are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president's nominee, and their voices deserve to be heard now, as leader mcconnell thought they should deserve to be heard then,"" said senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-new york. ""anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy.""

the swing vote

kennedy, 81, controlled the outcome of cases on hot-button issues like no other justice in recent history, as he often was the ""swing vote"" between the four liberal justices and the four more conservative justices.

a ronald reagan appointee who took the bench in 1988, kennedy's most lasting legacy will most likely be in the area of gay rights. in 2015, in it was kennedy who penned obergefell v. hodges, the landmark opinion that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide.

""they ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the constitution grants them that right,"" kennedy wrote.

personal dignity and liberty are constant themes in kennedy's jurisprudence as well as the limitation of federal power over the sovereignty of the states.

kennedy disliked the label of ""swing vote,"" but he did side with his conservative colleagues on issues such as campaign finance, gun control and voting rights. he also cast a vote with conservatives in bush v. gore, the 2000 case on disputed electoral results that cleared the way for the presidency of george w. bush.

kennedy authored the majority opinion in citizens united v. fec striking down election spending limits for corporations and unions in support of individual candidates -- an opinion that liberals and democrats on the campaign trail vowed to overturn.

to the dismay of conservatives, however, he joined the liberals on the court in other areas.

kennedy voted to reaffirm the core holding of roe v. wade in 1992, only to vote to uphold a federal ban on a particular abortion procedure in 2007.

nine years later, he sided once again with the liberals on the court to strike down a texas law that abortion rights supporters thought was the strictest nationwide. without kennedy's vote, the law would have been allowed to go into effect, inspiring other states to pass similar legislation.

in the same term, kennedy pivoted on the issue of affirmative action when he voted for the first time in favor of a race- conscious admissions plan at a public university.

after that term, former acting solicitor general neal katyal said, ""it is very much justice kennedy's court.""

""you can't understand how important his affirmative action opinion is without understanding his earlier jurisprudence,"" katyal said. ""for decades, he has been the court's most eloquent voice on the need to be color blind -- why he changed his mind is something historians will debate for decades.""

kennedy also wrote the decision striking down the death penalty for juvenile offenders in roper v. simmons.

he reflected on his role in close decisions in a 2010 interview.

""if the case is close 5-4 and let's say you are on the side that prevailed with the majority, there are not a lot of high-fives and back slaps. there is a moment of quiet, a moment of respect, maybe even sometimes awe in the process. we realize that one of us is going to have to write out a decision which teaches and gives reasons for what we do.""

who's on the shortlist?

trump wednesday said he would select a replacement from the list of possible justices that he released during his campaign.

""we have a very excellent list of great, talented, highly educated, highly intelligent, hopefully tremendous people,"" he said in the oval office. ""i think you see the kind of quality that we're looking at when we look at that list.""

possible top-tier candidates include judge brett kavanaugh of the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit and judge raymond m. kethledge of the 6th us circuit court of appeals, who are both former clerks of kennedy. judge thomas hardiman of the 3rd circuit was interviewed by the president as a runner-up for the antonin scalia seat.

also in the mix are individuals who trump has already nominated for lower court seats. that includes judges amul thapar and joan larsen, who sit on the 6th circuit. thapar has the support of senate gop leader mcconnell.

another potential is amy coney barrett, who trump nominated for a seat on the 7th circuit.

and a wildcard is utah gop sen. mike lee, a conservative who was on trump's list.

asked if he'd be interested in the job wednesday, lee noted that he ""started watching supreme court arguments for fun when i was 10 years old.""

""i would not say no,"" lee said.

although for many years kennedy served as the most important vote on the court, he was only the third choice of president reagan in 1987. the senate rejected robert bork after contentious hearings.

judge douglas ginsburg dropped out after admitting he had smoked marijuana when he served as a law professor for harvard.

but reagan praised his choice when he introduced him to the country, calling kennedy ""that special kind of american who's always been there when we needed leadership.""

like reagan, kennedy lived his early life in california. he was a catholic who was raised in a republican family in sacramento, and attended stanford and harvard law school.

kennedy is married to mary davis, and has three adult children.

U.S. Opposition to Breast-Feeding Resolution Stuns World Health Officials,428,8x2571,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/health/world-health-breastfeeding-ecuador-trump.html,147,1531092158.0,,"[like the science times page on facebook. | sign up for the science times newsletter.]

a resolution to encourage breast-feeding was expected to be approved quickly and easily by the hundreds of government delegates who gathered this spring in geneva for the united nations-affiliated world health assembly.

based on decades of research, the resolution says that mother’s milk is healthiest for children and countries should strive to limit the inaccurate or misleading marketing of breast milk substitutes.

then the united states delegation, embracing the interests of infant formula manufacturers, upended the deliberations.

[read more about how the trump administraton’s stance conflicts with existing medical advice.]

White House Eliminates Cybersecurity Coordinator Role,23,8zp0uh,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/technology/white-house-cybersecurity.html,4,1531889768.0,,"the white house eliminated the position of cybersecurity coordinator on the national security council on tuesday, doing away with a post central to developing policy to defend against increasingly sophisticated digital attacks and the use of offensive cyber weapons.

a memorandum circulated by an aide to the new national security adviser, john r. bolton, said the post was no longer considered necessary because lower-level officials had already made cybersecurity issues a “core function” of the president’s national security team.

cybersecurity experts and members of congress said they were mystified by the move, though some suggested mr. bolton did not want any competitive power centers emerging inside the national security apparatus.

the decision was criticized by mark r. warner, a senator from virginia and the ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee. “i don’t see how getting rid of the top cyber official in the white house does anything to make our country safer from cyber threats,” he wrote on twitter."
"Cancer patients who use alternative medicine die sooner, study finds",114,91gwrp,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cancer-patients-who-use-alternative-medicine-die-sooner-study-finds-n892841,18,1532463787.0,,"cancer patients who choose alternative medicine over standard, proven cancer treatments are more likely to die, researchers reported thursday.

complementary medicine did no apparent harm if people used it alongside conventional surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, the researchers found. but when people opted out of proven treatments to choose herbs, homeopathy or other alternative treatments, they were twice as likely to die of their cancer.

doctors and the food and drug administration have warned for years that unproven treatments may lure patients away from legitimate therapy that can save their lives. but it’s one thing to say that a treatment has not been shown to help, and it’s another to show for sure that it doesn’t.

“it’s shocking, the lack of comparative data that’s out there,” said dr. james yu of the yale cancer center.

yu and his team set out to show whether people who use complementary therapies are hurting their chances of surviving cancer.

they looked at the medical records of nearly 2 million cancer patients. not many admitted using complementary medicine, or had it noted in their records, but 258 did. their cases were compared with the cases of more than 1,000 patients who did not use complementary or alternative medicine.

those who chose alternatives such as herbs, homeopathy, naturopathy or chinese medicine were also more likely to refuse at least some standard cancer treatment, yu’s team reported in the journal of the american medical association’s jama oncology.

seven percent of those who chose complementary treatments refused surgery, for instance, they found — compared with just 0.1 percent of patients who just went with standard treatment. more than a third declined chemotherapy or hormone therapy, and half refused radiation therapy.

“if you could cure cancer with baking soda, who wouldn’t want to do that?""

those who chose alternatives tended to be younger women with more education and more money, they researchers found.

the message to doctors is clear, yu said.

“when a patient is using complementary medicine, make sure you are really listening to that patient and their needs because they are more likely to refuse treatment,” he told nbc news.

cancer patients have unrealistic views of the value of complementary therapy, yu’s team wrote.

“approximately two-thirds of patients with cancer believe that complementary medicine will prolong life and one-third expect it to cure their disease,” they wrote.

yu is sympathetic.

“i think it is a very human response — when faced with a treatment that is potentially disfiguring or toxic with real long-term effects — to wonder whether there is another way,” yu said.

“i totally get it. unfortunately, people who have cancer are very vulnerable to unscrupulous or perhaps well-meaning but ill-informed practitioners who offer a nonmedical treatment that is unproven but on the surface seems very desirable.”

it is not unreasonable to hope, yu said, and oncologists should listen to patients’ concerns.

“if you could cure cancer with baking soda, who wouldn’t want to do that? or if you could cure cancer with healing power crystals or positive thinking, who wouldn’t want that? i completely understand and empathize with patients,” he said.

and if a complementary treatment helps a patient feel better, alongside proven therapy, yu said he is all for it.

“there is a broad spectrum of complementary medicine used by patients with cancer, including herbs and botanicals, vitamins and minerals, traditional chinese medicine, homeopathy and naturopathy, as well as specialized diets,” his team wrote.

“past research has shown that complementary therapies such as massage, acupuncture, yoga and meditation can improve quality of life. thus, it is estimated that between 48 percent and 88 percent of patients with cancer have reported the use of complementary and alternative medicine as part of their therapy.”

the research team did not look at specific, individual alternative therapies but said they can include probiotics, ayurvedic medicine, deep breathing, yoga, tai chi, qi gong, acupuncture, chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, meditation, massage, prayer, special diets, progressive relaxation, and guided imagery.

“we need to do a better job of listening to our patients,” yu said. “the use of complementary medicine, i think, is very common and oncologists need to know that.”

The Lasting Trauma of Alex Jones’s Lies,9,94q8j7,https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/the-lasting-trauma-of-alex-joness-lies/566573/,1,1533483339.0,,"

this week, the new york times reported that alex jones, infowars founder and professional peddler of lies, is seeking more than $100,000 in court costs from the family of noah pozner, one of the 20 children who were murdered in the massacre at sandy hook elementary school in 2012. jones is seeking that amount to recover the court costs involved with his legal defense: veronique de la rosa and leonard pozner, noah’s mother and father, sued jones for defamation because of the conspiracy theories he spread about the sandy hook murders. jones insisted that the kids’ deaths were a great hoax, a performance staged by gun-control activists backed by the american government. as a result of that, noah pozner’s family says, they have been stalked and subjected to death threats by jones’s legions of epistemically gullible yet digitally savvy followers—a fact that has, doxxing by doxxing, forced them to move seven times over the past five years, ever farther away from the body of their slain son.

in her 2016 book the confidence game, an exploration of the minds and methods of con artists, maria konnikova argues that cons thrive, in particular, during times of transition—in the cultural chaos that typically results from the lurchings of economic and political shifts. that is because con artists are skilled above all, konnikova notes, at “exploiting the sense of unease we feel when it appears that the world as we know it is about to change.” now, in this time of american upheaval—populism, the digital transition, the storms of a stifled planet—con artists like alex jones have been given a microphone. and, with it, a megaphone.



here is a headline that cbs news ran on thursday: “alex jones’s lawyer makes case against sandy hook parents who claim death threats.” it’s a summary of events that makes clear, in its concision, the upside-down moralities of the jones case, which involves an attempt to gloss over the lies alex jones has told with normalizing legal niceties: arguments that his conspiracy theories are merely “opinion,” and that they therefore constitute speech protected by the first amendment. arguments that the parents of noah pozner, by virtue of their involvement in sandy hook as a news event, are public figures, and therefore required to prove that jones spread false claims as a result of actual malice, rather than mere confusion or callousness or negligence. which is to say: arguments that suggest a tacit acknowledgement of how thoroughly lies have infiltrated the very systems that were developed, over time, to arbitrate truth in america. arguments that engage in a great performance of equivalence: the lies on the one side of the table, the truths on the other. arguments that participate, in that, in a somber metaphor for a time in which journalists are mocked as liars and threatened as the enemies of the people, and in which expertise is dismissed as elitism, and in which truth has been allowed to be treated not as the only thing that matters, but rather as a choice—an option that is often, being all fact and no heart, an imposition. related video"
Hundreds take to Charlottesville streets a year after far-right rally,147,96nrmf,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-protests/hundreds-take-to-charlottesville-streets-a-year-after-far-right-rally-idUSKBN1KX023,38,1534090489.0,,"charlottesville, va. (reuters) - hundreds of students and left-wing activists took to the streets of charlottesville, virginia, on saturday, as a rally to mark the anniversary of last year’s white nationalist gathering turned largely into an anti-police protest.

with chants like, “cops and klan go hand in hand,” the protesters’ criticisms of both police and the university of virginia underscored the resentment that still exists a year after torch-bearing neo-nazis marched through campus, shouting anti-semitic messages and beating counterprotesters.

several students said they were angry that the police response was far larger this year compared with last year, when people carrying tiki torches the white nationalist rally went mostly unchecked.

at one point on saturday, dozens of officers in riot gear formed a line near where the rally was taking place, prompting many protesters to rush over yelling, “why are you in riot gear? we don’t see no riot here.”

the standoff ended without any clashes as organizers urged the crowd to move away and begin marching off campus. police, who appeared to be avoiding a confrontation, rode bicycles ahead of the march to stop traffic.

the newly installed president of the university of virginia, james ryan, apologized for the school’s inaction last year while speaking at an event to memorialize the anniversary.

saturday’s march capped a day of hope, grief, anger and remembrance in charlottesville, one year after the “unite the right” rally brought racially charged street violence to the scenic college town.

the organizer of last year’s rally, local blogger jason kessler, has planned a sequel for sunday in washington after being denied a permit in charlottesville.

with hundreds of police maintaining a tight security perimeter around a 15-block downtown area, charlottesville’s normally bustling business district was relatively quiet on saturday. the buzz of a police helicopter overhead was a constant throughout the day.

the massive police response was not welcomed by everyone, including some residents and business owners who complained that the restrictions were an overreaction.

the result, however, was a day largely devoid of conflict. authorities arrested three men for minor offenses, including a 64-year-old disabled man who appeared to deliberately challenge the prohibition on certain items in the secured area.

the man, john miska, who was wearing a handgun in a shoulder holster, visited a drugstore and purchased razor blades, which qualified as contraband under the city’s emergency declaration. the gun, however, was not banned, based on state law.

when he refused an officer’s request to take the razors to his car, he was arrested for disorderly conduct.

“this is the loss of our constitutional rights here in charlottesville,” he shouted, as officers led him away in plastic hand ties.

a group of anti-fascist protesters, sometimes known as “antifa,” marched in the afternoon, carrying signs with messages like “good night white pride.” they stopped to pay their respects at the corner where a local woman, heather heyer, was killed when an ohio man drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters following last year’s rally.

while some businesses closed for the weekend, many merchants remained open in a show of solidarity.

“it’s my town, and i’m not afraid,” said karen walker, whose floral shop hedge was open on saturday even though she did not expect much business. outside her front door, a bucket of freshly cut flowers was available for passersby to take for free.

many local residents also made a point of coming downtown to mark the anniversary. kathe falzer, 67, changed a flight to california so she could spend saturday in town.

“i felt the need to be here and support the businesses,” falzer said as she ate lunch at a diner on main street."

the private, pro-regime news outlet al-mayadeen originally reported that israeli airstrikes hit the airbase near damascus with multiple missiles. however, syrian state media later cited an unnamed military source denying the base was hit by israel.

the syrian arab news agency (sana) and syria state television reported a ""military source denies the exposure of the mazzeh airport to any israeli aggression and the sounds of explosions that were heard resulted from explosion of an ammunition depot near the airport because of electrical failure.""

about four explosions were heard coming from the direction of the military airport saturday, a damascus resident told cnn.

""i assume it was from an airstrike because of the explosions afterwards and ambulances with firefighters that went to the scene,"" the resident said.

The male infertility injustice: More than half the problems with infertile couples lie with the man - and sperm counts have fallen 60 per cent. So why does the IVF industry still focus almost wholly on women?,1,9f2i6b,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6152735/The-male-infertility-injustice-does-IVF-industry-focus-wholly-women.html,5,1536737449.0,,"male fertility in the west is in rapid decline.

data from the human fertilisation and embryology authority, which regulates infertility treatment in the uk, shows the number of infertile men being treated has doubled in just four years.

the biggest ever study of male fertility in the developed world revealed a 59.3 per cent reduction in average sperm count between 1973 and 2011.

‘we have a huge public health problem that, until now, was under the radar. health authorities should be concerned,’ says dr hagai levine, an expert in environmental health at the hebrew university in jerusalem, who led the study of declining male fertility which was published in the journal human reproduction update.

he says his findings should be treated as the ‘canary in the coalmine’, providing a warning for the future of male reproductive health.

poor lifestyle is a recognised factor. as dr channa jayasena, a specialist in diabetes and hormone activity based at hammersmith hospital in london, explains: ‘rising obesity and diabetes are major factors in increasing rates of male infertility. this is because they damage overall fitness.

‘but, inexplicably, many affected men are apparently fit and healthy. heavily processed foods, environmental pollution and lack of exercise may also be contributors to the problem.’

other researchers have suggested female hormones in the water supply — from the contraceptive pill — could also be a contributor.

last year the world health organisation warned that understanding of male infertility was ‘very low’ and the medical research council (mrc) in the uk issued a call for research proposals.

whatever the cause, it’s now acknowledged that in more than half of cases, the problems faced by infertile couples originate with the man.

helping hand: the couple, who’ve been together for ten years, were referred for nhs infertility treatment after two years of independently trying for a baby

and yet the infertility industry — which is led by gynaecologists focusing on female reproduction — continues largely to ignore them, even when it’s the male partner who is infertile.

one man good health spoke to told us he and his wife spent £20,000 on failed ivf, only to later be told by the clinic that the problem lay not with her but with his sperm quality.

‘there is a lack of recognition that male factor infertility is a problem — and because of this, a lot of ivf is unnecessary,’ dr ashok agarwal, a leading infertility specialist from the cleveland clinic in ohio, u.s. told good health.

jonathan ramsay, a urologist and male fertility expert at imperial college london, concurs: ‘it is well known that men are just as likely as women to be the cause of a couple’s inability to conceive.

‘but infertility specialists are invariably gynaecologists who specialise in women’s reproductive health and don’t have a detailed understanding of how to pick up defects in sperm production. there are relatively few of us working in this area.’

yet instead of a full health check and physical examination of their reproductive system, men are often simply asked to give a sperm sample which is then given only basic assessments to check for the number and movement (i.e. motility) of sperm — rather than, say, investigating why the sperm might be poor quality.

as the mail reported yesterday, the failure to diagnose or treat infertile men leads to the ‘absurd’ situation where women routinely have ivf when there is nothing wrong with their own fertility, according to sheena lewis, a professor of reproductive medicine at queen’s university in belfast and chair of the british andrology society.

‘we are giving an invasive procedure to a person who doesn’t need it in order to treat another person,’ she said. ‘that doesn’t happen in any other branch of medicine.’

professor lewis is campaigning for the use of sperm dna testing and has published numerous studies showing poor sperm will not work in assisted fertility treatment.

fact: last year the world health organisation warned that understanding of male infertility was ‘very low’ and the medical research council in the uk issued a call for research proposals

‘i think the ivf industry is out of control — it wrecks marriages, leaves people very unhappy and mostly doesn’t work,’ adds dr sheryl homa, formerly one of the world’s pioneering embryologists. she is now the scientific director at the private andrology solutions clinic in london, the only infertility centre in britain focusing on men.

‘ivf is much worse than cosmetic surgery,’ she adds. ‘if, like ivf, your facelift or breast augmentation carried only a maximum 30 per cent chance of working, you wouldn’t do it.’

the experts’ concerns are borne out by the experience of dan james, 32, a professional cellist from dartford in kent, and his wife gemma, 35, also a cellist. they tried for two years for a baby before seeking help in april 2015.

the couple, who’ve been together for ten years, were referred for nhs infertility treatment.

although he was quickly told the results of his sperm samples (which he had to do at home) showed he had very poor motility, meaning he would not be able to naturally father a child, ‘all the focus was on gemma’, says dan.

‘we went back to the gp but we were told i should just take multivitamins. he said that before we would be referred for ivf, my wife would still have to undergo at least six months of investigations even though i was the one with the identified fertility problem and she’d already had initial tests that showed she was ok.

there is a lack of recognition that male factor infertility is a problem — and because of this, a lot of ivf is unnecessary. dr ashok agarwal

‘they were going to put dye into her fallopian tubes to check they weren’t blocked, insert a balloon to check the uterus was all right and make her take clomid, a drug which makes women produce huge numbers of eggs, which in itself is unnatural.

‘doctors have a tick box mentality that they have to focus on women,’ he adds.

yet when it comes to male fertility, a low-tech approach may actually be much more useful and vastly less stressful for couples. there is increasing interest in boosting sperm quality in subfertile men by giving them antioxidant dietary supplements.

the theory is that low antioxidant levels mean sperm dna may be damaged, affecting swimming capability and the ability of the sperm to break through and fertilise an egg.

this summer, the european society of human reproduction and embryology conference in barcelona gave unprecedented space to the discussion of successful results from studies by dr agarwal and others, investigating dietary supplements and other treatments for sperm problems.

dr agarwal, a world authority on identifying methods of repairing and boosting sperm quality, has already produced a number of studies indicating benefits from antioxidant supplements such as lycopene (see box, below).

reduction: the biggest ever study of male fertility in the developed world revealed a 59.3 per cent reduction in average sperm count between 1973 and 2011

dr albert salas-huetos, of the universitat rovira i virgil in reus, spain, presented a study on the benefits of diet and eating nuts on sperm health.

this is what helped dan and his wife gemma finally conceive.

frustrated by the failure of the nhs to help, they used their savings to see dr homa, who referred dan for nutritional therapy with a ‘sperm-boosting’ diet — a mediterranean regimen with lots of vegetables and fruit, and a personally tailored menu of supplements devised by melanie brown, a london nutritionist specialising in improving fertility. melanie says three out of four of the subfertile men she treats go on to experience greatly improved sperm quality. ‘demand for this treatment has rocketed,’ she says.

‘men are much less willing to just accept the diagnosis that their sperm isn’t very good and they need to go for ivf or intracytoplasmic sperm injection [icsi, where a single sperm is injected directly into the egg],’ she says.

‘it is a very intrusive dehumanising experience, and i think its use is masking the problem of defective sperm. apart from anything else, we don’t know how many icsi babies will themselves be infertile.’

dan says: ‘after three months on the diet i had another sperm test which showed there was improved sperm quality — enough of a difference to mean i would be fertile.’

at this point, concerned that their age made conceiving naturally a risk, the couple opted for icsi. ‘it worked straight away,’ says dan, whose daughter, phoebe, will be two in november. ‘we were delighted and have no doubt it was as a result of all the preparation to improve my fertility. we’ll now try naturally,’ he says.

jim (not his real name), 39, a retail manager from west london, also credits the sperm-boosting diet and nutrients for his imminent fatherhood. he does not want to be identified because a leading ivf clinic is still supervising the 20-week pregnancy of his 38-year-old wife — even though she conceived naturally following treatment to improve his sperm quality.

‘i was more than a little annoyed to be told at the beginning that sperm quality was not a problem when it clearly was,’ he says.

‘the consultant who saw us after we had spent £20,000 on failed ivf said they needed to work on my sperm. i asked why his colleague had previously told us it wasn’t a problem. he didn’t answer.’

after six years of secret misery and failed fertility treatment, will walsh was also beginning to despair. ‘it was very difficult to talk to anyone about this,’ he says. ‘my friends and family didn’t know; i didn’t want the sympathy.

tomatoes could hold the key leading researchers are investigating lycopene, the nutrient that makes tomatoes red, as a treatment for poor sperm quality. lycopene is poorly absorbed from tomatoes, but numerous studies have shown that supplements containing modified forms of this and other nutrients, such as l-carnitine, could improve sperm. professor allan pacey, a male fertility specialist at the university of sheffield, has just completed a study looking at the effects on sperm production of a lactolycopene formulation called xy pro. (lactolycopene mimics the catalyst effect of olive oil in the mediterranean diet, which allows lycopene to be absorbed. lack of lycopene absorption in trials involving other supplements has until now inhibited efforts to measure its benefits as a health booster.) while pacey's results are yet to be published, he is hoping they will provide a ‘proof of concept’ for other studies. dr ashok agarwal, a world authority on improving sperm quality, has produced a number of studies on lycopene and other nutrients. ‘we have some promising results in terms of improved sperm, but more work is needed,’ he told good health. he cautions against self-medicating. ‘i am worried people are being given antioxidants whether they need them or not. if the sperm is normal, supplements can do damage.’ advertisement

‘your primary function is as a facilitator of reproduction, and if you can’t do that, you are seen as less of a man and someone who should be pitied.’

will, 33, is a fit, slim, natural athlete. a freelance commercial interior designer, he lives in kenton, devon, with wife dominique, 35.

will explains that when they first tried for a baby, ‘nothing was happening. so we went to the gp and were referred for specialist help. but they wanted to investigate dominique rather than me. she had a barrage of tests. we had them done privately just for speed. the results came back saying everything was fine.

‘then we asked if we could have sperm tests done.

‘my male gp said it would be done under my wife’s name. he said that was normal — all the treatments are done under a female name with the man as an accessory, which says it all really.

two sperm tests showed a low sperm count with poor motility, and the couple were offered ivf on the nhs. the first round failed.

‘at this point, almost two years after the first investigations and although i had undergone sperm tests which showed problems, i had not had a physical test done by anyone and the focus was still on my wife — even though she had no fertility problems.

‘during the consultation with the specialist after the failed ivf, there was still no discussion about whether there might be anything wrong with me. i was just a spare tool. it was all about my wife and what she should be doing.

‘after that we did our own research and discovered that dna damage to sperm wouldn’t be picked up in a normal sperm test.’

internet research led the couple to private treatment with dr ramsay. a physical examination immediately revealed a potential cause: a varicocele (a varicose vein in the testicle). this can overheat the sperm by reducing healthy circulation of a cooling blood supply.

a quick operation under local anaesthetic eliminated the defective blood vessel. dr ramsay then referred will to nutritionist melanie brown for a tailored three‑month sperm-boosting diet and supplements.

dr ramsay says: ‘we are trying out lots of different dietary interventions with some very good results, but often male infertility can be caused by something as simple as a variocele.’

since will embarked on the diet and supplements, tests indicate everything is working fine, and he and his medical team are ‘completely confident’ it will soon lead to a naturally conceived baby."
"Trump says official Puerto Rico hurricane death toll of 3,000 was made up by Democrats 'to make me look bad'",461,9fj3m8,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-tweet-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-death-toll-irma-twitter-a8536086.html%3famp,137,1536882273.0,[deleted],"donald trump has claimed that nearly 3,000 people did not die in puerto rico due to the impact of hurricane maria, despite the island’s government putting the official death toll at up to 2,975.

the president wrote on twitter that democrats inflated the death toll to make him “look as bad as possible” in the wake of criticism over his handling of the response to the disaster.

the official toll had been given as 64, before the release of findings from researchers from george washington university that lifted the total dramatically in a study commissioned by the us commonwealth’s government. while that number is an estimate, which could rise or fall, it is clear that the number of people killed is far in excess of the “6 to 18 deaths” mr trump claimed when he left the island having visited.

“3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit puerto rico. when i left the island, after the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths,” the president tweeted. ”as time went by it did not go up by much. then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000...”

“.....this was done by the democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when i was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild puerto rico,” the president continued. “if a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. bad politics.”

he added: “i love puerto rico!”

the president has spent the week celebrating his administration’s efforts to combat the destructive impact of hurricane maria on puerto rico and the us virgin islands, calling it an “unsung success” and adding in a televised statement to reporters in the white house, “if you ask the governor, he’ll tell you what a great job” was done.

that caused governor ricardo rosselló to release a statement criticising the president and correcting his claims.

“no relationship between a colony and the federal government can ever be called ‘successful’ because puerto ricans lack certain inalienable rights enjoyed by our fellow americans in the states,” the governor said in the statement. “this was the worst natural disaster in our modern history. our basic infrastructure was devastated, thousands of our people lost their lives and many others still struggle. now is not the time to pass judgement; it is time to channel every effort to improve the lives of over 3 million americans in puerto rico.”

meanwhile, hurricane florence is churning towards the us coastline as a category two storm, with an increasing potential for rainfall and storm surging at “catastrophic levels”, according to the national weather service.

"Trump 'dossier' stuck in New York, didn't trigger Russia investigation, sources say",203,9h0mo6,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-dossier-stuck-york-trigger-russia-investigation-sources/story?id=57919471,33,1537347611.0,[deleted],"trump 'dossier' stuck in new york, didn't trigger russia investigation, sources say despite what trump claims, sources say the russia probe began before ""dossier.""

president donald trump and his allies have long insisted that what he calls the “fake dirty dossier” was wholly “responsible for starting the totally and discredited witch hunt” by special counsel robert mueller.

but, beginning in july 2016, that so-called “dossier” actually sat for several weeks inside an organized crime unit at the fbi’s new york field office, even as counterintelligence agents in washington, d.c. – unaware of the new allegations – were already investigating russian efforts to hijack american democracy.

trump doubled down on his “dossier” accusation this week, ordering the justice department and u.s. intelligence community to release a bigger slice of the classified information used to investigate one of his advisers, new york business consultant carter page, insisting again tuesday that “what will be disclosed is that there was no basis” for the surveillance.

despite what trump and like-minded politicians have said, sources told abc news the “dossier” was plainly not the initial basis for the federal investigation.

the following account, relayed to abc news by several sources familiar with the federal probe, reflects how the fbi’s investigation into contacts between russian operatives and trump’s campaign team, including page, was well underway in the summer of 2016 by the time a former british spy handed the fbi a packet of startling and salacious allegations tied to trump.

in fact, the fbi already had an open counterintelligence case on page when he became a volunteer on trump’s foreign policy team in january 2016, according to sources familiar with the matter.

by then, trump had publicly claimed to have “a good instinct” about russian’s ruthless president, vladimir putin, had praised how putin was “running his country,” and had compared the kremlin’s assassinations of dissidents to the “plenty of killing” that happens inside the united states.

trump’s refusal to criticize putin – even in private – “mystified” then-fbi director james comey, he later recalled to abc news.

and three years earlier, when the fbi in 2013 was tracking two russian spies in new york, agents secretly recorded one of the spies saying he wanted to “recruit” page “as an intelligence source.” page had previously lived in moscow for three years.

page was never charged with any crimes and says he cooperated with that previous investigation, but sources told abc news his file, like many counterintelligence files, was never closed.

so, two months after page started advising trump’s campaign, the fbi paid him a visit in new york, asking about contacts with russian intelligence, according to a government document.

“an act of war?”

at the time, in the spring of 2016, the u.s. intelligence community had no clue the russian government was about to launch one of its most sophisticated and effective operations ever against the united states. russian hackers stole hundreds of thousands of emails from democratic institutions, and a global battalion of bots armed with “fake news” was deployed across social media.

“under what circumstances is a hack considered an act of war?” a reporter asked the state department spokesman on june 14, 2016, the day the democratic national committee revealed its systems had been breached. the government spokesman declined to answer.

three weeks later, carter page showed up in moscow. he was giving the commencement address at the new economic school, tied to some of the kremlin’s top officials, and the event was being broadcast live online.

“i am particularly grateful for my relationship with the faculty and staff at the new economic school,” he said at the start of his remarks, insisting he was there “as a private citizen.”

the date was july 7, 2016. page’s name wouldn’t first appear in the “dossier” for another two weeks.

the “dossier,” in fact, was not one single document but a series of 17 separate reports, compiled over six months by former british spy christopher steele.

steele was working for someone he knew well in washington, glenn simpson, whose firm, fusion gps, was hired by the dnc to conduct opposition research on trump.

by mid-july 2016, steele wanted to flag his findings to the u.s. government. he reached out to two old friends: bruce ohr, a senior justice department official whose wife worked for fusion gps and who, like him, closely tracked organized crime, and jonathan winer, an aide to then-secretary of state john kerry who has since spoken publicly about his contact with steele.

it’s unclear if ohr relayed steele’s reporting to anyone at the time – no public evidence suggests ohr passed it on then. but the state department’s response to steele was blunt: if you’re so concerned, take it to the fbi.

so that’s what steele did.

the ""dossier"" goes to the fbi, but to ""the wrong person""

in july 2016, steele already had a long-term contact in the fbi, and he had a reputation for digging up solid, verifiable information, sources told abc news.

he had been a reliable u.s. government informant, providing the state department alone with nearly 120 documents about russian efforts overseas with no connection to trump.

a few years earlier, steele helped an fbi agent in rome piece together a massive web of corruption within international soccer. the case against fifa made international headlines.

trying to take advantage of that relationship in july 2016, steele sent the fbi agent in rome the opposition research on trump he generated working for fusion gps.

the rome-based agent then forwarded the reports to an agent he worked with in the fbi’s new york field office – an agent with expertise in criminal organizations and organized crime, not counterintelligence, sources told abc news.

that was “the wrong person” to send the reports to, according to one source briefed on the russia probe.

steele’s research sat for weeks in the fbi’s new york field office, hundreds of miles away from the agents in washington scrutinizing ties between trump’s associates and the russian government, sources said.

“it took a long period of time for the new york field office to see it and realize what it was,” another source told abc news, referring to the ""dossier.”

an account of the fbi investigation released in february by democrats on the house intelligence committee reflected the delay.

“steele's reporting did not reach the counterintelligence team investigating russia at fbi headquarters until mid-september 2016, more than seven weeks after the fbi opened its investigation, because the probe's existence was so closely held within the fbi,” the memo by house democrats said.

“by then, the fbi had already opened sub-inquiries into [multiple] individuals linked to the trump campaign,” including carter page,” the memo noted.

in particular, the fbi was also already taking a close look at trump’s campaign manager, paul manafort.

manafort had spent years working pro-russia projects in ukraine, and the fbi actually interviewed him in 2013 and 2014 about those business dealings overseas. then in september 2016, the justice department’s national security division sent manafort a letter notifying him that he was in their crosshairs once again.

but what really prompted alarm within the fbi in the summer of 2016 was a tip from an australian diplomat: before the dnc hack ever became public, a low-level campaign staffer, george papadopoulos, told him that the kremlin had collected “dirt” on hillary clinton, namely thousands of emails.

the ""dossier"" reaches washington -- and the news media

in mid-september 2016, peter strzok, the now former fbi agent who was helping to lead the russia probe, received an “initial batch” of steele’s reports.

“the first time i am aware of the fbi having that information – the first time i saw it – was in mid-september,” he recently told lawmakers under oath.

in the days afterward, comey himself was briefed on steele’s findings, according to comey’s public statements.

steele, meanwhile, was meeting with reporters in washington, looking to share with them some of what he had already given to the fbi. steele did not show them copies of his reports, but he shared “indications” of “possible coordination of members of trump’s campaign team and russian government officials,” as steele would later describe it in british court filings.

within days, news outlets started publishing what steele told them. and lawmakers on capitol hill then pressed comey on the reports during a hearing on sept. 28, 2016.

comey wouldn’t answer specific questions, saying it would require him to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. but he offered this: “we are doing an awful lot of work through our counterintelligence investigators to understand just what mischief is russia up to in connection with our election.”

it’s unclear if at that time the fbi was already drafting the application it would file with the foreign intelligence surveillance court to secretly monitor page’s communications. two sources, however, said it takes “weeks” to put an application like that together.

on oct. 21, 2016, the fbi and justice department formally filed their application with the court. it was more than 50 pages long.

based on a heavily redacted version since released by the fbi, five pages covered “page’s connections” to russian intelligence services, at least five pages summarized news reports about page’s suspected connections to russia, and as many as six pages covered information provided by steele.

in particular, the application detailed steele’s allegations that page met with two of putin’s closest associates while in moscow two months earlier. page has denied ever meeting them, and no evidence has publicly surfaced to support that portion of steele’s reporting.

however, page would later acknowledge that while in moscow, he sent an email to trump campaign staffers saying he had “a private conversation” with russian deputy prime minister arkady dvorkovich who “expressed strong support for mr. trump and a desire to work together” on “current international problems.”

nevertheless, with the presidential election less than three weeks away, the fbi didn’t take any overt steps to move its investigation along.

as comey later explained to internal investigators, he believed in a “take no action” rule so close to an election.

“[we] avoid taking any action that could have some impact, even if unknown, on an election, whether that’s a dogcatcher election or president of the united states,” he told the investigators.

ohr becomes steele's conduit

while the fbi was holding off on taking any public steps in its investigation, steele was becoming increasingly anxious about trump in the late fall of 2016.

he even told ohr he was “desperate that donald trump not get elected,” as ohr later recalled in notes.

but steele lost his direct line to the fbi in the final days of october 2016, after the fbi realized he was talking to the press about his findings and his secret relationship with the u.s. government.

a week before the presidential election, the fbi suspended its relationship with steele and told him “not to operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the fbi,” according to fbi records since released.

steele, however, was sharing his findings with ohr, who became an avenue for the fbi to continue receiving the information that steele was gathering.

in fact, according to congressional documents, in the month after trump won the presidency, ohr met twice with officials from the fbi, including fbi attorney lisa page and strzok, the senior agent working the russia probe who privately expressed his own misgivings about trump.

ohr notified other senior colleagues in the justice department’s criminal division about his contacts with steele, but he did not notify his superiors in the deputy attorney general’s office, whom he reported to as associate deputy attorney general, sources with knowledge of the matter told abc news.

in a private interview with lawmakers, ohr said he didn’t inform his bosses because he was simply relaying information from a trusted source and didn’t believe he had to do so, according to one source familiar with ohr’s congressional testimony.

by thanksgiving 2016, it still “was not clear to us whether anyone at a high level of government was aware of the information that chris had gathered and provided to the fbi,” simpson later told congressional investigators.

so steele and simpson decided they would give steele’s reports to ohr – someone “higher up,” as simpson described ohr.

on dec. 10, 2016, simpson met ohr at a coffee shop in washington and handed ohr at least one thumb drive. ohr did not look at the contents of the thumb drive, though he suspected it might relate to steele’s work on trump, ohr later told congressional investigators, according to a source familiar with the testimony.

the day before, the late sen. john mccain hand-delivered his own copy of steele’s reporting to comey, according to sources familiar with the exchanges.

separately, ohr passed his newly-obtained material to the fbi.

“[our fbi colleague] met with bruce and got more stuff today,” strzok told lisa page in a text message on dec. 20, 2016.

“yeah, lots to read, but it all stressed me out too much,” the fbi attorney responded.

three weeks later, on jan. 9, 2017, steele’s reports became public when buzzfeed published them online.

the fbi investigation heats up

“hey let me know when you can talk,” strzok texted lisa page on jan. 10, 2017. “we’re discussing whether, now that this is out, we use it as a pretext to go interview some people.”

the cat was out of the bag, and the public release of steele’s reports gave the fbi a basis for taking more overt action.

three days after first texting lisa page about it, strzok started contacting people that the fbi identified as sources for steele’s reports.

“[w]e just want to talk to him quietly,” strzok recalled telling an attorney representing one of steele’s sources.

“it’s about the stuff in the news, isn’t it?” strzok quoted the attorney as responding.

indeed, it was.

the fbi, meanwhile, was starting to focus on others completely unassociated with steele’s reporting. for the first time, agents approached two key trump associates for interviews: then-national security adviser michael flynn, and george papadopoulos, the adviser who was told early on that russia had stolen “dirt” on hillary clinton.

in those interviews, later confirmed in their guilty pleas, flynn lied about his contacts with russian officials, and papadopoulos lied about his own interactions with individuals tied to the kremlin.

those false statements in january 2017 “impeded the fbi’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the [trump] campaign and russia’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” flynn and papadopoulos would each later admit in court.

around the same time, the fbi submitted another application to the foreign intelligence surveillance court, asking a federal judge for permission to continue monitoring carter page’s communications. the application noted that the fbi had suspended its relationship with steele, but said his information was still deemed “reliable as previous reporting from [him] has been corroborated and used in criminal proceedings.”

the fbi’s latest submission was 66 pages long – nearly 16 pages longer than the initial application.

meanwhile, fbi officials continued to meet with ohr – speaking with him at least eight more times in the months after trump’s inauguration, including twice after robert mueller was appointed special counsel in may 2017 and took over the broader investigation, according to congressional documents.

in june 2017, a month after mueller’s appointment, the fbi filed yet another application with the foreign intelligence surveillance court to continue tracking carter page. the application was 77 pages long.

a fourth – and final – application was filed three months later.

heavily-redacted versions of the applications were released in july.

trump issues an order

on monday, trump ordered that more portions of the application from june 2017 be released.

it’s unclear why trump did not order the release of sections from the other applications, but the first application in october 2016 was based on information steele provided himself, not information provided by ohr, according to congressional investigators and public evidence presented so far.

trump also ordered the release of the fbi’s notes from ohr’s meetings with the agency about what steele was telling him. the justice department and director of national intelligence are now undertaking a review of the documents covered by trump's order and could request redactions.

trump’s move to release more classified information came just days after several republican house members held a press conference calling on him to declassify the documents, with rep. jim jordan, r-ohio, saying it’s time for the fbi and justice department “to come clean” about “the wrongdoing that took place.”

but democrats swiftly condemned what they called trump’s “clear abuse of power.”

""[he] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,” the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, rep. adam schiff, d-calif., said in a statement on monday.

trump’s order came three days after manafort – in a case with no link to steele’s reporting – pleaded guilty to financial-related crimes and agreed to cooperate with mueller’s office.

“president trump’s actions … are a direct and frantic response to the dramatic events that unfolded last friday,” the top democrats on the house judiciary and oversight committees -- rep. jerrold nadler, d-n.y., and rep. elijah e. cummings, d-md. – said in a statement on monday.

having previously pleaded guilty to lying to authorities, papadopoulos was recently sentenced to two weeks behind bars. his case also was not connected to steele’s reporting.

flynn, who also pleaded guilty to lying to authorities and agreed to cooperate with mueller, is expected to be sentenced in the coming weeks – another case not tied to steele’s reporting.

the broader federal probe, meanwhile, continues.

Accuser's schoolmate: I recall hearing of alleged Kavanaugh incident,176,9h82yb,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/accuser-s-schoolmate-says-she-recalls-hearing-alleged-kavanaugh-incident-n911111,164,1537413124.0,[deleted],"washington — a former schoolmate of brett kavanaugh’s accuser wrote a facebook post saying she recalls hearing about the alleged assault involving kavanaugh, though she says she has no first-hand information to corroborate the accuser’s claims.

""christine blasey ford was a year or so behind me,"" wrote the woman, cristina king miranda, who now works as a performing arts curator in mexico city. ""i did not know her personally but i remember her. this incident did happen.""

she added, ""many of us heard a buzz about it indirectly with few specific details. however christine's vivid recollection should be more than enough for us to truly, deeply know that the accusation is true.""

in an interview with npr thursday, king miranda was more equivocal than she was in her facebook post.

""that it happened or not, i have no idea,"" she told npr's nina totenberg. ""i can't say that it did or didn't.""

""in my [facebook] post, i was empowered, and i was sure that it probably did. i had no idea that i would have to now go to the specifics and defend it before 50 cable channels and have my face spread all over [msnbc] and twitter.”

but king miranda did not back off her assertion that she recalls hearing about an incident involving kavanaugh at a party.

cristina king miranda via twitter

ford, a research psychologist in northern california, has accused kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her more than 30 years ago at a drunken high school party. he denies the allegation.

the assertion that other people heard about and discussed an incident between ford and kavanaugh at the time it is alleged to have happened could loom as an important factor in any investigation of the claim.

democrats are calling for the fbi to investigate, but the bureau cannot do so unless the white house asks it to. there is no allegation of a federal crime, so the bureau's role would be to examine the matter as part of its background check into the fitness and character of a supreme court nominee.

king miranda has since taken down her facebook post, which nbc news verified as having appeared on her account. she said on twitter that she deleted it ""because it served its purpose and i am now dealing with a slew of requests for interviews … organizing how i want to proceed. was not ready for that, not sure i am interested in pursuing. thanks for reading.""

she later posted on facebook: ""to all media, i will not be doing anymore interviews. no more circus for me. to clarify my post: i do not have first hand knowledge of the incident that dr. christine blasey ford mentions, and i stand by my support for christine. that's it. i don't have more to say on the subject. please don't contact me further.""

nbc news confirmed that the statements were hers, but did not confirm her allegation. king miranda has also been critical of trump administration policy on social media.

ford's lawyer has said she wants the fbi to conduct an inquiry before she testifies in a public hearing. republicans have scheduled a hearing for monday at which they want to hear from her and kavanaugh.

blasey ford told the washington post that she told no one of the incident ""in any detail"" until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.

in her original post, king miranda said she knew kavanaugh and mark judge, the man ford says was present during the alleged assault. judge has said through his attorney he remembers no such incident.

king miranda graduated in 1983 from holton-arms, the elite all-female private school that ford also attended, according to an open letter king and many other alumnae signed in support of ford.

king miranda's post described a culture of heavy drinking among the students of the elite male and female private schools of washington, d.c., including her own holton-arms and also georgetown preparatory school, which judge and kavanaugh attended.

judge has written two memoirs acknowledging his heavy drinking during that period. in his 1997 memoir, ""wasted,"" judge writes about a ""bart o'kavanaugh,"" who passes out drunk and throws up in a car.

holton-arms did not return a call seeking verification of king miranda's attendance. but a 1982 yearbook lists ""cristina king"" as a student, and member of the holton-arms athletic association, an honor society. in her senior year, she led the school chorus as president, according to the 1983 yearbook. ""cristina king was able to keep the chorus members in tune as they trooped up to hill and lawrenceville to dazzle the boys with their talent and good looks,"" the club's yearbook page reads.

ford appears in both yearbooks as well. she graduated in 1984.

king miranda's linkedin page says she attended brown university and worked for a decade in washington, d.c. before moving to mexico.

(ap photo/j. scott applewhite)

washington (ap) — president donald trump denounced democratic efforts to block brett kavanaugh’s supreme court confirmation as a cynical “con job” on tuesday and launched a dismissive attack on a second woman accusing the nominee of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, asserting she “has nothing.”

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell predicted that kavanaugh would win approval, despite the new allegations and uncertainty about how pivotal republicans would vote in a roll call now expected early next week. like much of america, lawmakers awaited a momentous senate judiciary committee hearing in which kavanaugh and chief accuser christine blasey ford are to testify thursday, though not together.

committee chairman chuck grassley said arizona prosecutor rachel mitchell will be brought in to handle questioning of kavanaugh and ford. mitchell comes from the maricopa county attorney’s office in phoenix, where she is the chief of the special victims division, which covers sex crimes and family violence.

hanging in the balance is trump’s chance to swing the high court more firmly to the right for a generation. despite mcconnell’s forecast that republicans will “win,” kavanaugh’s fate remains uncertain in a chamber where republicans have a scant 51-49 majority.

“i will be glued to the television,” said sen. susan collins, a moderate republican from maine, who has yet to declare her position on confirmation.

hoping the hearing will yield no new surprises, the senate judiciary committee scheduled its own vote on kavanaugh for friday, and republican leaders laid plans that could keep the full senate in session over the weekend and produce a final showdown roll call soon after — close to the oct. 1 start of the high court’s new term.

given that the judiciary committee’s gop members are all male, mcconnell said the panel was hiring a “female assistant” to handle the questioning for republicans “in a respectful and professional way.” grassley, r-iowa, identified mitchell in a press release late wednesday, describing her as “a career prosecutor with decades of experience prosecuting sex crimes.”

“my gut is they’re trying to avoid a panel of all white guys asking tone-deaf questions,” said democratic sen. chris coons of delaware.

each senator on the 21-member panel will be allowed five minutes to ask questions, said committee spokesman taylor foy. that’s a tight rein for such a major hearing.

meanwhile, the republicans were still assessing what kavanaugh’s monday interview on the fox news channel — an unusual appearance for a supreme court nominee — indicates about how he would do in thursday’s hearing.

during the interview, kavanaugh denied sexually assaulting anyone. he also denied the account of a second woman, deborah ramirez, who told the new yorker magazine that kavanaugh caused her to touch his penis at a party when both were yale freshmen.

some in the white house expressed relief that kavanaugh, 53, presented a positive image to counter the allegations. yet he appeared shaky at times. and there remained concern among aides and trump himself about how kavanaugh would hold up facing far fiercer questioning from senate democrats, according to a white house official not authorized to speak publicly.

the no. 2 senate republican, john cornyn of texas, acknowledged that for the nominee “it’s extremely awkward to be talking about such private matters on tv.” but cornyn said he thought kavanaugh “did well and did what he needed to do” in the interview.

yet kavanaugh’s accounts of his behavior in high school and college have faced intense scrutiny, with some of his former classmates coming forward to challenge his claims. james roche, a yale graduate who says he was kavanaugh’s roommate in 1983, issued a public statement saying he was “close friends” with ramirez and “cannot imagine her making up” the story about kavanaugh exposing himself.

while a few republicans have strongly challenged the credibility of kavanaugh’s accusers, trump’s words have been more biting. last week, he lampooned ford’s allegation that an inebriated kavanaugh trapped her beneath him on a bed at a high school house party and tried to take her clothes off before she escaped. surely she would have reported it to police if the encounter was “as bad as she says,” the president said.

“it’s a con game they’re playing,” he said tuesday. “they’re really con artists. they don’t believe it themselves, ok?”

trump’s latest broadside was aimed at ramirez, who conceded to the new yorker that she’d been drinking at the time she says kavanagh exposed himself. she also said she was uncertain of some details.

“the second accuser has nothing,” trump told reporters at the united nations. “the second accuser doesn’t even know— thinks maybe it was him, maybe not. she admits she was drunk. she admits time lapses.”

predictably, that played badly with democrats.

“how many women have heard that before? how many women have kept their experiences quiet because they knew they would hear that?” sen. patty murray of washington said of trump’s characterization.

she said trump’s remarks were “disgusting, it’s disgraceful and by the way, women are paying attention.” she herself was carried to washington on a 1992 wave of fervor by female voters, a year after the senate discounted sexual harassment allegations against clarence thomas and sent him to the supreme court.

in a phone call with judiciary committee staff of both parties, kavanaugh denied ramirez’s story, panel spokesman foy said.

ramirez’s attorney, john clune, said his client stood by the new yorker story and said he and grassley’s committee were trying to decide how to provide more information to the panel. he said an fbi investigation — which democrats have also sought for ford and trump and republicans have blocked — “is the only way to get the truth.”

aides said kavanaugh answered questions by judiciary panel staff members about ramirez’s allegations

republicans are concerned that, win or lose, the battle over kavanaugh’s nomination is further animating women already inclined to vote against trump’s party in november’s elections in which control of the next congress is at stake.

treatment of ford, 51, on thursday will be watched closely.

sen. lisa murkowski of alaska, a potentially key republican vote, said gop senators need to come into the hearing with open minds.

“it’s very important to take allegations of those who come forward seriously, and i think we need to go into this hearing with the view that we will listen,” she said.

grassley is planning to use his committee’s modest-sized hearing room instead of a far larger chamber that’s often home to high-profile hearings. he said in a recent letter that the smaller room would help avoid a “circus atmosphere,” and ford herself has sought to limit the number of tv cameras and journalists covering the event.

congressional testimony is often magnified by tv close-ups, and a single moment, good or bad, can have a major impact.

New Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick details parties where she says girls were drugged and raped,360,9j3gvd,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/26/michael-avenatti-identifies-kavanaugh-accuser-as-julie-swetnick.html,328,1538004193.0,,"a third accuser of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh publicly identified herself wednesday and alleged that kavanaugh and others in the early 1980s spiked the drinks of girls at high school parties with intoxicants to make it easier for them to be gang raped. the woman, julie swetnick, said kavanaugh lined up with other boys, including his close friend mark judge, waiting to rape those girls at many parties — and that she once became a victim herself. the allegations were detailed in an affidavit, signed under penalty of perjury, that was released by swetnick's lawyer, michael avenatti. her statement was sent to a senior staffer on the senate judiciary committee. swetnick's stunning claims came on the eve of scheduled testimony at that committee by kavanaugh, 53, and christine blasey ford, who has said he ""physically and sexually assaulted me"" in the early 1980s. the now-51-year-old research psychologist ford claims kavanaugh held her down on a bed when she was 15, groped her and tried to pull off her clothes asjudge watched. republicans who hold the majority on the committee have refused to subpoena judge to testify despite calls to do so from democrats, ford's lawyers and avenatti. another woman, kavanaugh's yale university classmate deborah ramirez, has accused him of exposing himself and causing her to touch his penis at a boozy dorm party. the latest accusations from swetnick against kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, could make his already imperiled nomination to the supreme court even less likely to succeed. all 10 democrats on the judiciary committee on wednesday urged president donald trump to either ""immediately withdraw the nomination or order an fbi investigation into all the allegations.""

kavanaugh, 53, called swetnick's claims ""ridiculous and from the twilight zone."" ""i don't know who this is and this never happened,"" said kavanaugh, who earlier this week told fox news ""i've never sexually assaulted anyone."" in a letter to judiciary committee leaders made public after swetnick's claims, kavanaugh vowed not to withdraw his nomination. but avenatti, during an interview with msnbc, said, ""there should be an immediate investigation"" of her accusations ""and there should be no rush to confirm him to the u.s. supreme court."" ""the allegations in this declaration are shocking,"" avenatti said. trump blasted the claims in a tweet calling avenatti ""a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations like he did on me and like he is now doing on judge brett kavanaugh."" tweet avenatti immediately fired back: tweet trump's press secretary, sarah huckabee sanders, told cnbc that the white house ""stands with kavanaugh."" later, when trump was asked by a reporter in new york if he thinks ""all three women are lying,"" trump replied: ""what's your next question."" judge's lawyer, barbara van gelder, said, ""mr. judge vehemently denies the allegations contained in the swetnick affidavit."" judge has said said he no memory of events described by the other accuser ford. senate republicans have cited his claim to justify the decision no to call him to testify thursday. the washington post reported later that judge's ex-girlfriend, elizabeth rasor, informed the judiciary committee through her lawyer on wednesday that she is willing to speak to the committee and the fbi about her recollection of what judge allegedly told her an incident involving group sex. the new yorker, in a story about ramirez's allegations, reported sunday that ""rasor recalled that judge had told her ashamedly of an incident that involved him and other boys taking turns having sex with a drunk woman. rasor said that judge seemed to regard it as fully consensual. she said that judge did not name others involved in the incident, and she has no knowledge that kavanaugh participated in it.""

source: fox news

swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, identified herself in the affidavit as a resident of washington, d.c. while avenatti had generally described swetnick's allegations in an email to the judiciary committee on sunday, he had not previously identified her until wednesday. a 1980 graduate of gaithersburg high school in maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the treasury department, u.s. mint, irs, state department and justice department, among other government agencies. swetnick says in her affidavit that she saw kavanaugh in the early 1980s ""drink excessively at many"" house parties in suburban maryland. at the time, kavanaugh and judge were students at georgetown prep, a private catholic all-boys school. she said kavanaugh and judge engaged in ""abusive and physically agressive behavior toward girls,"" which ""included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent"" and ""not taking 'no' for an answer."" during the years of 1981 and 1982, she said, she learned of efforts by kavanaugh, his friend judge and others ""to spike the drinks of girls at house parties i attended with grain alcohol and/or drugs so as to cause girls to lose inhibitions and their ability to say 'no.'

"Trump Administration to Deny Visas to Same-Sex Partners of Diplomats, U.N. Officials",227,9kq8xy,https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/01/trump-administration-to-deny-visas-to-same-sex-partners-of-diplomats-un-officials-gay-lgbt/,37,1538512854.0,,"trump administration to deny visas to same-sex partners of diplomats, u.n. officials

the trump administration on monday began denying visas to same-sex domestic partners of foreign diplomats and united nations employees, and requiring those already in the united states to get married by the end of the year or leave the country.

the u.s. mission to the u.n. portrayed the decision—which foreign diplomats fear will increase hardships for same-sex couples in countries that don’t recognize same-sex marriage—as an effort to bring its international visa practices in line with current u.s. policy. in light of the landmark 2015 supreme court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, the u.s. extends diplomatic visas only to married spouses of u.s. diplomats.

“same-sex spouses of u.s. diplomats now enjoy the same rights and benefits as opposite-sex spouses,” the u.s. mission wrote in a july 12 note to u.n.-based delegations. “consistent with [state] department policy, partners accompanying members of permanent missions or seeking to join the same must generally be married in order to be eligible” for a diplomatic visa.

but critics says the new policy will impose undue hardships on foreign couples from countries that criminalize same-sex marriages.

samantha power, a former u.s. ambassador to the united nations, denounced the new policy on twitter as “needlessly cruel & bigoted.”

“state dept. will no longer let same-sex domestic partners of un employees get visas unless they are married,” she tweeted, noting that “only 12% of un member states allow same-sex marriage.”

in july, the u.s. mission sent out diplomatic notes to the united nations and representatives for foreign diplomatic missions explaining the new policy, which reversed a 2009 decision by then-secretary of state hillary clinton to grant visas to domestic partners of u.s. and foreign diplomats. the contents of the diplomatic note were first reported in august by the washington blade. the 2009 policy, however, did not allow a heterosexual domestic partner of a u.s. or foreign diplomat to enter the country on a diplomatic visa.

the new policy —which enters into force monday—requires that foreign domestic partners of diplomats and u.n. officials posted in the united states must show the state department proof of marriage by dec. 31, or leave the country within 30 days. as of today, domestic partners of diplomats and u.n. officials based abroad will need to show they are married in order to enter the country on a diplomatic visa. the latest policy change, the united states explained in the note, was aimed at ensuring all couples were treated equally.

“the department of state will not issue a g-4 visa for same-sex domestic partners,” the u.n. human resources chief explained in a note distributed to staff last month. “as of 1 october 2018, same-sex domestic partners … seeking to join newly arrived u.n. officials must provide proof of marriage to eligible for a g-4 visa or to seek a change in such status.”

there are currently at least 10 u.n. employees in the united states who would need to get married by the new year to have their partners’ visas extended.

the new policy poses a number of risks for same-sex partners, according to alfonso nam, the president of u.n. globe, a u.n. lgbti staff advocacy organization.

same-sex couples already inside of the united states could go to city hall and get married. but they could potentially be exposed to prosecution if they return to a country that criminalizes homosexuality or same-sex marriages.

the united states informed foreign governments that they would allow “limited exceptions” to its new policy in cases involving diplomats from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal. but that government would have to provide documentation proving that same-sex marriage was illegal and commit to accepting same-sex partners of u.s. diplomats.

yet that exception was not offered to u.n. officials.

“with this change, the state department is enforcing parity in the way they recognize opposite-sex partnerships and same-sex partnerships,” u.n. globe said in a statement. “it is an unfortunate change in rules, since same-sex couples, unlike opposite-sex couples, have limited choices when it comes to marriage.”

GM breaks with Trump administration and calls for nationwide electric-car sales program,632,9s3gd8,http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-gm-fuel-efficiency-20181026-story.html,87,1540765042.0,,"two of the biggest automakers are pushing back on the trump administration’s proposed rollback of u.s. fuel-economy standards.

in filings due friday, general motors co. planned to propose that, rather than oppose california’s so-called zero-emission vehicle sales mandate, federal regulators should embrace a nationwide electric-car sales program starting in 2021. honda motor co., meanwhile, took exception to president trump’s proposed freeze on mileage standards and called for steadily increasing requirements to continue.

the responses, to be proposed in formal comments to regulators, mark one of the clearest signs yet of the auto industry’s misgivings about the proposal to cap federal fuel-economy requirements in 2020 and unwind california’s power to set its own automobile fuel-efficiency standards and its zero-emission vehicle mandate.

“we know that we can do better” than the trump proposal, mark reuss, gm’s executive vice president of global product development, told reporters in advance of the deadline. “we know that the industry can do better than that.”

gm says a nationwide program could put 7 million long-range electric cars on the road and slash 375 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, compared with existing zero-emission vehicle mandates.

the environmental protection agency and the national highway traffic safety administration in august recommended keeping federal fuel-economy requirements at 37 mpg from 2020 through 2026, instead of raising them to about 47 mpg by 2025 under rules adopted by the obama administration.

the agencies also want to revoke the most populous u.s. state’s authority to adopt fuel-efficiency rules of its own, including its electric car mandate.

in comments friday, the california air resources board called on the trump administration to withdraw its plan.

“the only clear winners from the efficiency-killing proposal are oil companies.” said richard corey, the arb’s executive officer, in a letter to federal regulators.

while the auto industry sought relief from the obama rules, carmakers view the trump administration’s response as too aggressive. they fear it could force them to build vehicles for california and 12 other states that follow similar standards, and another fleet for the rest of the nation. that, said gm’s reuss, would be “very costly, and frankly unnecessary.”

automakers also worry about a drawn-out court fight.

california and 18 other states plan to attack the epa and nhtsa proposal as unlawful. california atty. gen. xavier becerra on wednesday called it arbitrary and capricious, and said that it violates procedural requirements and the epa’s statutory obligation to reduce harmful pollution.

“gm is taking a leadership position in at least offering an alternative to what could be this endless battle between the federal government and california,” said michelle krebs, an autotrader analyst. “whether the administration will accept it, that’s another question.”

toyota motor corp. said it too favors a 50-state emissions plan, saying in a statement that it is optimistic that “adjustments” can be made to the current regulations “that will continue environmental progress” and satisfy regulators and companies while avoiding a patchwork of rules.

the alliance of automobile manufacturers also said it supports a national standard with california’s continued involvement. the association of 12 automakers including gm, toyota and volkswagen ag urged federal regulators to set “achievable” standards that “advance environmental and energy goals while recognizing marketplace realities.”

some greeted gm’s proposal with skepticism. david friedman, a former nhtsa deputy administrator during the obama administration, said in a statement that unless a national electric car mandate is coupled with stringent efficiency requirements, carmakers could still prioritize gas guzzlers and blunt emissions reductions.

“the devil is in the details,” said friedman, the vice president for advocacy at consumer reports. “we hope gm is truly serious about this proposal. if they are, they will support the existing [greenhouse gas] standards they committed to meet back in 2012 and sit down with us and other organizations to craft a proposal designed to help all consumers.”

in its comments on the u.s. proposal, honda said it disagreed with the trump administration’s plan for revoking california’s rule-making authority and that key elements of the federal government’s analysis on traffic safety are flawed and should be scrapped.

honda said pursuing the administration’s preferred option would “bring years of uncertainty for the auto industry” while state and federal regulators duke it out in court.

“a far better path would be for federal and state policymakers to negotiate a national program that is acceptable, if not ideal, for all parties including automakers,” honda wrote.

advertisement

honda also recommended that the epa maintain greenhouse gas targets that grow tougher each year instead of freezing them.

“the industry is united in its request that the agencies work out an agreement with california,” honda said in its comments.

after initially heated rhetoric when the proposal was released, u.s. and california officials agreed to hold talks to explore whether uniform standards nationwide can be maintained. senior u.s. officials have also said they’d like to reach a compromise, but no deal has materialized thus far.

in a statement on thursday, the free-market institute for energy research said the existing standards are too aggressive, effectively requiring automakers to produce electric cars that consumers still purchase in relatively small numbers.

advertisement

the group supports the proposed rollback, saying manufacturers currently must raise prices of more popular autos to compensate for losses on electric vehicles, unfairly penalizing suburban and rural consumers who tend to be more concerned about driving range and reliability.

but krebs said gm is concerned that the u.s. could fall behind europe and asia in the development of electric cars. the automaker is also hoping officials will enhance a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric-car buyers that will soon begin to be phased out over several quarters for gm, tesla inc. and others, she said.

to be sure, gm stands to benefit if the proposal gains traction. it’s readying a range of new electric cars and plans to begin an ev-based robotaxi business in the coming years. gm’s proposal seeks “additional consideration” for electric vehicles placed into autonomous ride-hailing fleets.

reuss said a national electric-car program would ease some of the challenges that this type of vehicle presents to all automakers.

“it will facilitate more makers to be able to really focus on development of electric vehicles more efficiently, and take the guesswork out of what we think may or not happen,” he said. “we’re making bets on a lot of uncertainty, which is highly destructive to capital.”

Exclusive: Trump to terminate birthright citizenship,350,9smhsl,https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html,300,1540922993.0,,"president trump plans to sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on u.s. soil, he said yesterday in an exclusive interview for ""axios on hbo,"" a new four-part documentary news series debuting on hbo this sunday at 6:30 p.m. et/pt.

why it matters: this would be the most dramatic move yet in trump's hard-line immigration campaign, this time targeting ""anchor babies"" and ""chain migration."" and it will set off another standoff with the courts, as trump’s power to do this through executive action is debatable, to say the least.

[get more stories like this in our daily morning newsletter, axios am. sign up here.]

trump told ""axios on hbo"" that he has run the idea of ending birthright citizenship by his counsel and plans to proceed with the highly controversial move, which certainly will face legal challenges.

""it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. guess what? you don't,"" trump said, declaring he can do it by executive order .

that you needed a constitutional amendment. guess what? you don't,"" trump said, declaring he can do it by executive order when told that's very much in dispute, trump replied: ""you can definitely do it with an act of congress. but now they're saying i can do it just with an executive order.""

very much in dispute, trump replied: ""you can definitely do it with an act of congress. but now they're saying i can do it just with an executive order."" ""we're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the united states ... with all of those benefits,"" trump continued. ""it's ridiculous. it's ridiculous. and it has to end."" (more than 30 countries, most in the western hemisphere, provide birthright citizenship.)

in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the united states ... with all of those benefits,"" trump continued. ""it's ridiculous. it's ridiculous. and it has to end."" (more than 30 countries, most in the western hemisphere, provide birthright citizenship.) ""it's in the process. it'll happen ... with an executive order.""

the president expressed surprise that ""axios on hbo"" knew about his secret plan: ""i didn't think anybody knew that but me. i thought i was the only one. ""

behind the scenes: ""axios on hbo"" had been working for weeks on a story on trump’s plans for birthright citizenship, based on conversations with several sources, including one close to the white house counsel’s office.

the legal challenges would force the courts to decide on a constitutional debate over the 14th amendment, which says:

""all persons born or naturalized in the united states, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside.""

be smart: few immigration and constitutional scholars believe it is within the president's power to change birthright citizenship, former u.s. citizenship and immigration services chief counsel lynden melmed tells axios.

but some conservatives have argued that the 14th amendment was only intended to provide citizenship to children born in the u.s. to lawful permanent residents — not to unauthorized immigrants or those on temporary visas.

that the 14th amendment was only intended to provide citizenship to children born in the u.s. to lawful permanent residents — not to unauthorized immigrants or those on temporary visas. john eastman, a constitutional scholar and director of chapman university's center for constitutional jurisprudence, told ""axios on hbo"" that the constitution has been misapplied over the past 40 or so years. he says the line ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" refers to people with full, political allegiance to the u.s. — such as green card holders and citizens.

michael anton, a former national security official in the trump administration, recently took up this argument in the washington post.

anton said that trump could, via executive order, ""specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens"" simply because they were born on u.s. soil. (it’s not yet clear whether trump will take this maximalist argument, though his previous rhetoric suggests there’s a good chance.)

that trump could, via executive order, ""specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens"" simply because they were born on u.s. soil. (it’s not yet clear whether trump will take this maximalist argument, though his previous rhetoric suggests there’s a good chance.) but others — such as judge james c. ho, who was appointed by trump to fifth circuit court of appeals, in new orleans — say the line in the amendment refers to the legal obligation to follow u.s. laws, which applies to all foreign visitors (except diplomats) and immigrants. he has written that changing how the 14th amendment is applied would be ""unconstitutional.""

between the lines: until the 1960s, the 14th amendment was never applied to undocumented or temporary immigrants, eastman said.

between 1980 and 2006, the number of births to unauthorized immigrants — which opponents of birthright citizenship call ""anchor babies"" — skyrocketed to a peak of 370,000, according to a 2016 study by pew research. it then declined slightly during and following the great recession.

the number of births to unauthorized immigrants — which opponents of birthright citizenship call ""anchor babies"" — skyrocketed to a peak of 370,000, according to a 2016 study by pew research. it then declined slightly during and following the great recession. the supreme court has already ruled that children born to immigrants who are legal permanent residents have citizenship. but those who claim the 14th amendment should not apply to everyone point to the fact that there has been no ruling on a case specifically involving immigrants in the country illegally or those with temporary legal status.

the bottom line: if trump follows through on the executive order, ""the courts would have to weigh in in a way they haven't,"" eastman said.

"Nearly 3,000 Votes Disappeared From Florida’s Recount. That’s Not Supposed to Happen",112,9xyyt0,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/voting-machines-florida.html,2,1542510009.0,[deleted],"nearly 3,000 votes effectively disappeared during the machine recount of florida’s midterm races, according to election records, calling into question whether officials relied on a flawed process to settle the outcome of three statewide contests.

with extremely narrow gaps separating candidates in the still-undeclared races for both governor and united states senate, the results of the machine recount of all votes cast in the nov. 6 election, posted by the florida secretary of state’s office, showed 900 fewer votes than those reported in the original statewide tally.

the discrepancy was expected to grow by an additional 2,000 votes when updated numbers from broward county, whose results initially were disqualified because they came in two minutes late, are added to the statewide results on sunday.

[update: andrew gillum has conceded to ron desantis in florida governor’s race.]

none of the discrepancies would be enough to affect the outcome of the three statewide and three local elections that are still waiting for a winner to be called. but they come as at least three florida counties — two of them democratic strongholds whose results could be decisive — have reported problems counting their shares of the more than 8.1 million ballots cast across the state."
"The Less People Understand Science, The More Afraid Of Gmos They Are",615,9zonfn,https://psmag.com/news/the-less-people-understand-science-the-more-afraid-of-gmos-they-are,137,1543011728.0,,"a research biologist takes tissue samples from genetically modified corn plants inside a climate chamber housed in monsanto agribusiness headquarters in st louis, missouri. (photo: brent stirton/getty images.)

americans with low levels of science knowledge are more likely to mistrust food additives and genetically modified foods, according to a new survey from the pew research center.

this is one of a few major takeaways from the report, which surveys americans' attitudes toward the risks certain foods pose. the researchers estimate that about half the country feels that food additives pose a serious risk to health over time (51 percent) and a similar number feels that genetically modified food is worse for health (49 percent).

unsurprisingly, people's food ideologies—their feelings about what foods are good and bad and what food can do to or for a person—inform their feelings about genetically modified food and food additives, as well as their thoughts on diet and health. across the board, however, women are slightly more likely to mistrust additives and genetic modification in food. that's especially consequential because, across the country, women are more likely to influence what families eat, either as mothers or as other caregivers.

the other major predictor of how people feel about additives and genetic engineering is their level of science literacy. the pew study included nine general science knowledge questions, and based on the responses of those surveyed, about a quarter of americans (26 percent) have a low level of science knowledge, compared with 49 percent with middling knowledge and 24 percent with high knowledge. the lower levels of science literacy are associated with higher levels of perceived risk: 43 percent of the group with low science understanding said that pesticides on produce pose a great deal of risk to a person's health over time, while only 20 percent of the group with high science literacy said the same thing.

a different pew study found that most americans believe scientists are split on the safety of genetically modified food, even though that's not the case (the american association for the advancement of science and the national academies of science, engineering and medicine, among others, say they're safe to eat). some have pointed to the back-and-forth coverage of health and diet science as a reason for the uncertainty, although in a 2016 pew study on genetically modified organisms (gmos) and food, 66 percent of respondents called this whiplash good science. but for most people, these attitudes are malleable and not strongly linked to party affiliation or identity—what researchers call ""soft"" beliefs. broad food ideologies, like attitudes about health, fitness, and ideal diets, cut across political affiliations, gender, and race lines. the researchers mention that the landscape of food technology is in flux, and there's ongoing debate in the public sphere on the health effects of the modern diet. as leaders and influencers in the dietary world change their positions and recommendations, people's perceptions change too.

but even among those who have a high level of science literacy, it can be hard to know what, exactly, is in our food, and what the implications of those additives are. the pew study asked people about foods with ""genetically modified ingredients"" to mimic common discussions, but exactly what that means is up for debate. in the united states, the department of agriculture has ruled that some gene editing is functionally the same as traditional crop breeding, and crops made with those procedures won't be called ""genetically modified."" but the european court of justice has declared that all gene-edited crops should be regulated as gmos. meanwhile, some of the most common additives have been common for decades, and many occur naturally in foods.

a concerning implication, the researchers note, is ""chemophobia"" among the general public—the irrational fear of ""chemicals"" as synthetic, man-made compounds that are bad for us. (everything around us is made of chemical compounds.) consumers tend to prefer ""natural"" food—a label without any standard definition in the u.s. regulatory sphere—and tend to worry that any addition to foods diminishes its ""natural"" qualities, but a substance's toxicity doesn't depend on where it comes from. many natural substances are dangerous to human health, and many substances that are dangerous in large quantities are necessary in smaller doses. for example, formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but our bodies also manufacture and metabolize it naturally as our cells make amino acids and other building blocks of life. its presence in consumer products and vaccines alarms some consumers, but the level of exposure is so low there's no evidence of any harm. even if you choose unaltered ""all-natural"" foods, you can't get away from it—formaldehyde is found naturally in milk, meat, and produce."
Death of Guatemalan toddler detained by ICE sparks $60 million legal claim.,20,a4tn3i,https://abcnews.go.com/US/death-guatemalan-toddler-detained-ice-sparks-60-million/story?id=59640202,1,1544456626.0,,"death of guatemalan toddler detained by ice sparks $60 million legal claim mariee juarez died after becoming ill in an ice detention facility in texas.

a guatemalan toddler who died weeks after crossing the u.s.-mexico border with her mother is at the center of a wrongful death claim that's seeking $60 million from the federal government.

mariee juarez and mother yazmin, who told abc news she was fleeing an abusive situation at home, illegally crossed into the united states earlier this year, but they were detained and taken to a family detention center in dilley, texas, where all medical care is provided by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement health services.

medical records obtained by abc news amid an ongoing investigation of health care practices in immigration detention centers in partnership with the nonprofit criminal justice watchdog the marshall project show there was no indication mariee was sick when she entered the facility, but she soon developed a respiratory infection that yazmin says was inadequately treated for nearly two weeks.

mariee visited the health clinic several times, medical records show, where she was seen on several occasions by physician assistants and a nurse, but she only saw an actual doctor once.

""frankly, to me, it was completely irresponsible,"" yazmin told abc news of her daughter's medical treatment at the dilley facility. ""i think they should think about the children. the children are little angels, and this is not their fault.""

after 20 days at the detention facility, yazmin and mariee were released to fly to join yazmin's mother in new jersey. according to yazmin's wrongful death filing, no medical personnel examined or cleared mariee for the flight. mariee's condition worsened on the flight, and hours after landing she was taken to the emergency room. after six weeks in hospitals, she died.

on nov. 27, lawyers for yazmin filed an administrative wrongful death claim seeking $60 million from the federal government. in a letter accompanying the claim, attorney r. stanton jones asserted ""mariee died because the medical care she received at the dilley detention facility was woefully inadequate, neglectful, and substandard.""

in response to questions from abc news, an ice spokesperson said the agency was unable to comment because of yazmin juarez's legal claim but released a statement saying, ""ice takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care ... including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care.""

but critics say mariee's case is not an isolated one. human rights watch, the prominent international research and advocacy organization, obtained medical records for 52 ice detainees who've died since 2010, and their experts concluded that almost half of those death were linked to substandard healthcare.

dr. mark stern, a former healthcare consultant for the department of homeland security who once investigated allegations of insufficient or poor healthcare at ice facilities, said those records show people are ""needlessly dying"" in a ""broken system.""

""i'm not surprised that people are dying,"" stern told abc news. ""it is preventable.""

for yazmin, the tragedy has left her with an uncertain future.

""after all the ugly things i lived in guatemala, i had so many dreams for her, so many expectations,"" she said.

but she's sure she knows why her daughter died.

""i think it was because they did not care,"" she said. ""they didn't care.""

Disabled Army vet after ICE arrests husband: ‘This is not really what I fought for’,13,a67z1j,https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/421413-disabled-army-vet-after-immigrant-husband-arrested-by-ice-this,6,1544844372.0,,"a disabled army veteran said her immigrant husband and father to her four children was detained by immigration and customs enforcement (ice) in new jersey despite being a legal resident for more than 20 years.

alexsa foster’s husband, dane foster, was arrested last week by ice after they dropped their daughter off of at daycare in westampton, news site nj.com reported thursday.

""this is not really what i fought for and signed up for when i joined the military. it's not what i thought this country could be,"" alexsa foster, 28, said.

she spent seven years in the u.s. army and the national guard as a mechanic. she fractured her pelvis and now suffers from seizures and migraines which leave her unable to work.

dane foster is a jamaican immigrant who has been a legal resident with a green card since 1997. the couple have four children, ages 2 through 9.

his lawn maintenance service business is their main source of income for the family, nj.com reported.

his lawyer told the outlet that he was arrested because of multiple marijuana possessions charges stemming from the early 2000s and 2014, according to nj.com.

""dane was convicted of simple marijuana possession – a disorderly persons offense in new jersey,"" attorney afia yunus told the news site. ""no criminal record for the past four years.""

dane foster was not jailed for the charges and paid a fine, yunus said.

the trump administration has ramped up arrests of immigrants who break the law even if they have been living in the country legally for decades, the outlet noted.

ice reportedly picked up 105 immigrants during a massive sweep in new jersey that spanned 16 counties. officials said those arrested in that raid were immigrants without legal status or foreign nationals who are wanted for crimes in their home countries, nj.com reported.

dane foster’s previous conviction could subject him to deportation.

“ice conducts targeted immigration enforcement actions in compliance with federal law. dane foster, a jamaican national, is subject to removal from the u.s. based on his criminal history. he has been entered into immigration proceedings with the executive office for immigration review,"" ice said in a statement to nj.com."
How MSG Got A Bad Rap: Flawed Science And Xenophobia,409,aab5gq,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-msg-got-a-bad-rap-flawed-science-and-xenophobia/,40,1546039164.0,,"as a college student in new york city, i marveled that the city let me eat poached eggs with halloumi cheese and moroccan spiced pita for breakfast, a spicy-sweet minced meat salad from northern thailand for lunch, and singaporean nasi lemak for dinner. my requisites were pretty straightforward: delicious, cheap and served in bulk. but if i was eating chinese, i added one more: no msg.

like many people, i thought msg — monosodium glutamate, a chemical compound used to enhance the flavor of food — was bad for me, and i was sure i felt terrible every time i ate it. after all, i was sluggish and had headaches and achy limbs whenever i ate a big meal in chinatown. now i know that the recurring headaches that plague me have little to do with what i eat. but at the time, avoiding those three letters brought me comfort and let me think i’d be eating some sort of sacredly pure meal made with food, not chemicals. oh, how young and foolish i was.

that msg isn’t the poison we’ve made it out to be has been well-established. news stories are written regularly about the lack of evidence tying msg to negative health effects. (read here and here, for example. or here, here, here, here and here.) still, yelp reviews of chinese restaurants tell tales of racing hearts, sleepless nights and tingling limbs from dishes “laden with msg.” even when the science is clear, it takes a lot to overwrite a stigma, especially when that stigma is about more than just food.

since its discovery in the early 1900s, msg has been synonymous with delicious. when added to foods, it increases umami, which has been considered the fifth taste since the early 2000s (alongside sweet, sour, salty and bitter ) and varyingly translates from japanese as “tasty,” “scrumptiousness,” “deliciousness” or “savory.” umami is the full-bodied, savory taste found in a wide variety of foods, such as parmesan and mushrooms, as well as in most meat. msg is its crystallized manifestation.

kikunae ikeda, a japanese chemist, discovered the compound in 1907 while investigating a common quality he’d noticed in foods like asparagus, tomatoes and the soup broth his wife made with seaweed. he determined that glutamate, the ionic form of glutamic acid, was responsible for umami. he then figured out how to synthesize the molecule by extracting glutamate from seaweed and mixing it with water and table salt to stabilize the compound. ikeda patented the finished product, and it became one of japanese food science’s greatest commercial successes. today, the crystallized seasoning, frequently made from beets and corn, is known as msg in the u.s. but is often called by the name ikeda first gave it — “aji no moto,” or essence of taste — in other parts of the world.

the fine, white powder was first sold in slender bottles meant to attract bourgeois housewives who were embracing science in the kitchen because it suggested hygiene and modernity, according to research by jordan sand, a professor of japanese history at georgetown university. in china, it was touted to buddhists, who periodically abstained from eating meat, as a vegetarian way to improve flavor.

by the 1950s, msg was found in packaged food across the u.s., from snacks to baby food. (sand said in his 2005 paper that his 1953 edition of “the joy of cooking” referred to monosodium glutamate as “the mysterious ‘white powder’ of the orient … ‘m.s.g.,’ as it is nicknamed by its devotees.”) soon, though, msg’s chemical nature would turn against it. after the publication of rachel carson’s “silent spring” and federal bans on sweeteners that the food and drug administration deemed carcinogenic, consumers began to worry about chemical additives in their food. in 1968, the new england journal of medicine published a letter from a doctor complaining about radiating pain in his arms, weakness and heart palpitations after eating at chinese restaurants. he mused that cooking wine, msg or excessive salt might be to blame. reader responses poured in with similar complaints, and scientists jumped to research the phenomenon. “chinese restaurant syndrome” was born.

early on, researchers reported an association between consuming msg and the symptoms cited in the new england journal of medicine. inflammatory headlines and book titles followed: “chinese food make you crazy? msg is no. 1 suspect,” wrote the chicago tribune, while books titled “excitotoxins: the taste that kills” and “in bad taste: the msg symptom complex” prompted fda reviews and “60 minutes” investigations, as alan levinovitz, a professor of chinese philosophy at james madison university, chronicled in a 2015 book about food myths.

but those early studies had essential flaws, including that participants knew whether or not they were consuming msg. subsequent research has found that the vast majority of people, even those claiming a sensitivity to msg, don’t have any reaction when they don’t know they are eating it.

that msg causes health problems may have thrived on racially charged biases from the outset. ian mosby, a food historian, wrote in a 2009 paper titled “‘that won-ton soup headache’: the chinese restaurant syndrome, msg and the making of american food, 1968-1980” that fear of msg in chinese food is part of the u.s.’s long history of viewing the “exotic” cuisine of asia as dangerous or dirty. as sand put it: “it was the misfortune of chinese cooks to be caught with the white powder by their stoves when the once-praised flavor enhancer suddenly became a chemical additive.”

the concern wasn’t just among the public, however. from the late 1960s to early 1980s, “chinese restaurant syndrome” was considered a legitimate ailment by many in the medical establishment, according to mosby’s research. the same can’t be said today. while nearly all the u.s. research that has suggested msg is safe has been funded by companies that have a stake in msg’s success, researchers think the science that underlies them is sound.

of course, a small subset of people do have negative reactions that are directly due to glutamate, but the science to date shows that is likely to be a rare phenomenon. msg is still, and has always been, on the fda’s “generally recognized as safe” food list. several allergists i reached out to who were once go-to experts on the subject declined to comment, saying that they no longer keep up with the research.

just because there isn’t a scientific association between a given food and negative health effects doesn’t mean the pain or discomfort experienced by diners is imaginary. people who suffer after eating msg may be experiencing the nocebo effect, the lesser-known and poorly understood cousin of the placebo effect. the phenomenon is what happens when suggesting that something can cause a negative reaction induces precisely those physical symptoms. when a chinese restaurant puts “no msg” on its menu to reassure customers, it furthers the stigma, likely furthering the nocebo effect in the process. as with the placebo effect, the nocebo effect can have very real reactions.

with various chefs speaking publicly about the value of msg, in addition to the medical establishment, the time may be ripe for the public to follow. but changing minds likely won’t be easy.

as brendan nyhan, a dartmouth professor who has researched how to influence attitudes about vaccines, pointed out to me in an email, it’s hard for people to change their minds about personal health issues because it contradicts what they have perceived to experience in the past. “people who felt bad after eating chinese food in the past may have blamed msg … and thus resist information they encounter later about its actual effects,” he said. this may be the result of the availability heuristic, where people make judgments using the easiest information available, rather than looking for alternative explanations.

as my colleague christie aschwanden has explained, once we reach false conclusions, our brains prevent us from accepting new information that can correct those mistaken assumptions.

when it comes to msg, the false connections are fairly innocuous for most people but may still cause unnecessary discomfort for some, either because they are experiencing the nocebo effect or depriving themselves of deliciousness. we all make choices about how we eat; for some people, those decisions are based on supporting local economies, avoiding meat for the humane treatment of animals, or simply wanting to know what goes into their bodies. there’s no right or wrong, but it’s worth understanding the origins of those choices. in the case of msg, they appear to have been less about science and more about the culture and politics of the day.

Elizabeth Warren Announces She Is Running for President in 2020,472,ab7m8y,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-president-announcement.html,356,1546295747.0,,"after a midterm election in which many women, liberals, minorities and young democrats won, the presidential primaries and caucuses next year are likely to be fought over not only who is the right policy match for the party, but also which mix of identities should be reflected in the next nominee. the range of candidates will also force democratic voters to consider which electoral approach is best suited to defeat mr. trump, balancing questions of ideological purity with how to appeal to a wide range of demographic groups like white rural voters, suburban women, college students, and black and latino democrats in the south and the sun belt.

ms. warren, 69, is among the best-known democrats seeking to take on mr. trump, whom she has denounced in the past as “a thin-skinned racist bully” and a “wannabe tyrant.” mr. trump, who has already announced his re-election campaign, frequently mocks her as “pocahontas” because of her claims to native american ancestry, a slur native american groups have denounced as a racist epithet.

while ms. warren’s stinging attacks on mr. trump and wall street have helped make her a favorite of grass-roots liberals, she also faces challenges as a presidential candidate: controversy over a dna test to prove her native american heritage, skepticism from the party establishment and a lack of experience in a national race.

the editorial board of the boston globe, her hometown newspaper, recently urged her not to run for president, saying she had become “a divisive figure.” and some in her party believe she missed her best chance to run in 2016, when liberal activists urged her to challenge hillary clinton.

two potential top-tier candidates who have run before, former vice president joseph r. biden jr. and senator bernie sanders, are eyeing 2020 and are expected to disclose their plans this winter. yet both men carry political baggage and would be in their late 70s on election day 2020, and many democrats say they want a fresh face as their next nominee."
The McConnell Era Has Been Terrible for American Politics,539,ac7d56,https://reason.com/archives/2019/01/03/the-mcconnell-era-has-been-ter?fbclid=IwAR1ADCBcgBHsICeeZOB5WPe0_vyIQmLcJ9Jvwm4F2P5cu7F34Gksd-PDBgo,67,1546562151.0,,"we tend to think of political eras in terms of presidents: the 1980s remind us of ronald reagan, not senate majority leader howard baker. the same is true of the 1990s and bill clinton, the post-9/11 era and george w. bush, the years after the financial collapse and barack obama. now, it is assumed, we are in the era of donald trump.

but are we? trump is certainly the most visible elected leader in our national political life. but with his inescapably controversial persona serving as the starkest partisan dividing line in our polarized age, he is, perhaps more than any other modern president, also a figurehead—a president-in-name-only, elected to sit in the oval office and tweet into the abyss, which may or may not tweet back.

meanwhile, the real work of legislating and governing is done by others—in particular, by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. mcconnell, the chelonian senior senator from kentucky, is almost certainly the most influential republican in either chamber of congress. he is the architect of his party's legislative strategy and the tactician behind its more process-oriented victories. where mcconnell goes, the rest of the gop tends to follow.

and under obama and now trump, mcconnell—whose steely temperament and avoidance of the limelight make him the current president's stylistic opposite—has adopted a form of politics that is partisan and procedural, focused above all on tactical and electoral victory rather than broad policy goals or ideological transformation. in many ways, it is his world we're living in rather than trump's.

to understand mcconnell's method, it's important to remember that before he was majority leader, he served for four years as the senate gop's whip during the bush administration. the whip is the party leader's top lieutenant, and his job is both to count votes and to pressure them into existence. it was in this role that mcconnell developed a reputation for being a canny legislative tactician with a deep knowledge of the senate's often-arcane rules and traditions and the ways they could be used to advance the party's interests.

but the whip's role is to execute an agenda set by someone else rather than to develop a long-term legislative vision of his own. the goal isn't to change the world or make it a better place. it's to deliver the party a win.

mcconnell has carried over that focus on discrete partisan victories to his tenure as leader. he counts votes and secures them, and he uses the rulebook to achieve narrow victories, but when it comes to policy—the substance of legislation—he's a cypher whose only real guidestar seems to be the maintenance of political power.

that's true even of his two most consequential victories: the confirmations of neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh to the supreme court. gorsuch's vacancy existed only because mcconnell refused for most of a year to hold a vote on president obama's nominee, merrick garland. keeping the seat open not only let trump nominate a replacement, it created pressure on trump-skeptical republicans during the 2016 election by providing a strong reason for them to vote against hillary clinton. both gorsuch and kavanaugh were confirmed with a simple majority after mcconnell ended the minority party's ability to filibuster supreme court nominations.

the same pattern applies to the gop's two biggest legislative initiatives during trump's first year in office: obamacare repeal and tax reform.

when health care reform advanced to the senate, mcconnell tore up the house bill and started from scratch, producing complex legislation via an insular process run out of his office. even his fellow republican senators were unclear about what was in the bill at any given time; sometimes they relied on lobbyists to find out. despite the opacity of the process, mcconnell declined to hold extensive hearings on the bill or to make a sustained public case for its virtues. he pushed legislators into up-or-down votes on legislation that no one really understood, releasing rushed, sometimes handwritten changes just hours before the roll call.

in the end, the bill, which failed in a dramatic late-night session, was little more than a shell, with details to be filled in at some later point. mcconnell was not pursuing any particular policy goals. he was pursuing only a legislative victory.

the tax bill that followed was more successful, yet once again the process was centrally run, with little allowance made for outside input and little time for analysis or argument. it passed on mcconnell's explicit assurances that it would spark enough economic growth to produce a net reduction in the federal budget deficit, which so far it has not. but mcconnell made clear that he saw it as necessary to enact if republicans wanted to do well in the 2018 midterms. it was an electoral ploy as much as a policy achievement, and it was led almost entirely by the senate majority leader.

or consider the criminal justice reform legislation that has been working its way through congress this year. although the bill commands bipartisan support in the senate and is backed by advocacy groups on both the right and the left, mcconnell worked to slow it throughout the fall, reportedly informing trump in november that there wouldn't be time for a vote this year. he also gave a platform to republican opponents of the legislation, such as arkansas sen. tom cotton, in internal discussions. trump held a press conference announcing his support for the measure, but mcconnell is in the driver's seat, and he suspects enacting criminal justice reform on a bipartisan basis would hand democrats a victory. the bill's political fortunes were significantly imperiled because of him.

mcconnell's resistance on criminal justice reform—one of the most politically unifying issues in the country right now—is especially notable given his public calls for bipartisan cooperation following this year's midterm election. the success of the next congress, he wrote in a fox news column, would ""depend on our democratic colleagues. will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference?""

we know what mcconnell would choose. under obama, he declared that his highest priority was to make him a one-term president. his primary tactic was to refuse to work across the aisle on any significant legislation, ever. the ""key,"" mcconnell explained, ""was to deny the president, if possible, the opportunity to have any of these things be considered bipartisan."" that was how mcconnell would win.

this is not to say that bipartisanship is a good unto itself. but it is one that mcconnell tends to deploy with brazen selectivity, in service of hollow partisan gain.

there is an important place in politics for victory, of course, and some of mcconnell's wins, particularly when it comes to filling court seats, will probably net out for the best. but his single-minded focus on tactics and procedure, on working the machinery of politics to grind out wins, has almost certainly come at a cost: it has made our nation's politics more starkly divided and more nakedly partisan—more like a team sport in which the game is all that matters than a system of productive democratic compromise between differing ideological visions.

mcconnell is neither the first nor the only elected lawmaker to engage in this sort of cynical politicking, but he is its most prominent and successful current practitioner. our era—the mcconnell era—is defined by his empty, partisan, point-scoring approach and the deleterious ripple effects it has had across our political institutions. among other things, it gave us donald trump."
"In an Astonishing Letter, Delta and United Airlines Pilots Just Told President Trump To Stop and Think",446,acz2f9,https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/delta-united-airlines-pilots-to-president-trump-cut-nonsense.html,242,1546755996.0,[deleted],"absurdly driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek.

our government is becoming a little like a restaurant near my house.

sometimes, you really need it, but you never know whether it's going to be open or not.

the owners seem to use the restaurant's opening hours like a ransom, there to elevate your blood pressure and to make the proprietors feel important.

delta and united airlines pilots -- and those of jetblue and many other airlines -- have had enough.

in a scorchingly fact-based letter to president trump, the air line pilots association -- which represents 61,000 pilots -- used simple words.

its president, captain joe depete wrote:

i am writing to urge you to take the necessary steps to immediately end the shutdown of government agencies that is adversely affecting the safety, security and efficiency of our national airspace system.

depete explained that the department of transportation and the department of homeland security operate as both regulators and service providers.

mechanical inspections, drone oversight, and new enhanced communications systems are all threatened.

worse, air traffic controllers, airspace system maintenance personnel, and air marshals are working unpaid.

moreover, cnn now reports that hundreds of tsa screeners are calling in sick. could the fact that they're not being paid have an influence?

this, too, says depete, could jeopardize safety:

the pressure these civil servants are facing at home should not be ignored. at some point, these dedicated federal employees will encounter personal financial damages that will take a long time from which to recover, if at all.

by writing directly to the president -- and merely copying congressional leaders -- the pilots appear to be holding him responsible for the potential dangers flowing from the shutdown.

it's a remarkably forthright approach, one that might make some uncomfortable, given that it has inevitable political overtones.

by saying that only the president can and should take the necessary steps, the pilots seem to recognize that, whatever the merits (or demerits) of a wall, it isn't worth risking airline safety for what some believe is a symbol of power rather than an effective security measure.

the letter contains no words about the president's reasons for the shutdown. it contains no expressions of understanding that a wall is important.

instead, it feels like please stop this nonsense now."
Poll shows federal workers don't prefer a border wall to getting paid,709,ahxiba,https://news.yahoo.com/poll-shows-federal-workers-dont-prefer-border-wall-getting-paid-155101845.html,68,1548018908.0,,"president trump has claimed repeatedly that most federal workers support his tactic of shutting down the government to enforce his demand for a border wall — including those directly affected by it. but a new poll of government employees shows that few actually do.

according to the survey conducted by the government business council and govexec.com and released tuesday, 71 percent of federal workers oppose the shutdown, compared to just 21 percent who support it. just 34 percent of federal employees surveyed support trump’s demand for funding for the wall, while 56 percent oppose it. and of those workers against the wall, more than 80 percent say they are strongly opposed to it.

meanwhile, a pair of recent national polls show most americans blame the president for the shutdown. according to a cnn survey released monday, 56 percent of americans oppose a border wall, while 39 percent favor one. and according to a pbs newshour/marist poll released wednesday, 54 percent say trump is to blame for the impasse, while 31 percent put the blame on democrats in congress. (five percent of those polled blame congressional republicans.) and more than 70 percent believe shutting down the government in order to reach an agreement on policy is a bad strategy, compared to just 22 percent who do.

among those who consider the strategy flawed: 35 percent of republicans.

trump is demanding congress allocate $5.7 billion that would go toward construction of a physical barrier on the u.s. border with mexico in exchange for reopening the government. democrats are refusing to do so, and want the government reopened while negotiations continue.

the shutdown, now in its 26th day, is the longest in u.s. history. about 800,000 federal employees have been affected. approximately half of those are continuing to work without pay, although they are likely to receive back pay after a budget is passed. the rest are furloughed.

for the first time ever, a funding impasse is affecting active-duty military personnel.

story continues

on tuesday, u.s. coast guard commander adm. karl schultz advised more than 40,000 active duty members that they would not be receiving their regularly scheduled mid-month paycheck.

“to the best of my knowledge, this marks the first time in our nation’s history that service members in a u.s. armed force have not been paid during a lapse in government appropriations,” schultz wrote in a letter to them. “i recognize the anxiety and uncertainty this situation places on you and your family, and we are working closely with service organizations on your behalf.

“you have proven time and again the ability to rise above adversity,” he added. “stay the course, stand the watch, and serve with pride. you are not, and will not, be forgotten.”

Stop Trusting Viral Videos,491,ailn92,https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/viral-clash-students-and-native-americans-explained/580906/,83,1548182437.0,,"read: video doesn’t capture truth

film and photography purport to capture events as they really took place in the world, so it’s always tempting to take them at their word. but when multiple videos present multiple possible truths, which one is to be believed? given the new footage, some, such as the libertarian outlet reason, said the students were “wildly mischaracterized.” others, such as the washington post, tried to cast the matter more neutrally, concluding that the aftermath “seemed to capture the worst of america at a moment of extreme political polarization.”

but rather than drawing conclusions about who was vicious or righteous—or lamenting the political miasma that makes the question unanswerable—it might be better to stop and look at how film footage constructs rather than reflects the truths of a debate like this one. despite the widespread creation and dissemination of video online, people still seem to believe that cameras depict the world as it really is; the truth comes from finding the right material from the right camera. that idea is mistaken, and it’s bringing forth just as much animosity as the polarization that is thought to produce the conflicts cameras record.

there’s an old dispute in film theory between form and content. for most people, the meaning of moving images seems to relate to the footage inside them—the people, settings, and events that the camera pointed at and captured. but in fact, the way those elements were selected, edited, and re-presented has an enormous impact on the way they are received and understood. in the case of the lincoln memorial encounter, neither the original video nor the new one explains what “really happened.” instead, both offer raw material that can take on various meanings in different contexts.

because the newer video of the lincoln memorial encounter is so much longer, some would contend that it offers clarity about how the conflict arose. but if you watch the video in its entirety, it’s hard to find much clarification. instead, it offers a large quantity of raw material from the same time and place. that footage betrays just how easy it is to find provocative moments in an otherwise ordinary sequence of events.

for example: at one point, the black hebrew israelite protester holding the camera engages with a woman who had pointed out that guatemala and panama are indigenous names with their own meaning, different from names such as indian or puerto rico ascribed by spanish conquistadors. “i am from panama,” the cameraman claims, “so now i’m indigenous from panama … we indigenous, so we out here fighting for you.”

as best i can tell, the speaker means to argue that allegedly being from panama, a place host to some indigenous peoples that bears an indigenous name, aligns his interests with those of north american indigenous peoples who had assembled for the indigenous peoples march. to say that this is a spurious argument would be putting it mildly; it’s a bit like me, a white man who lives in atlanta, home of the civil-rights leader martin luther king jr., arguing that my intentions are necessarily aligned with those of modern extensions of the black civil-rights movement, such as black lives matter."

""i look forward to giving a 'great' state of the union address in the near future!"" he added.

trump's move to delay delivering the annual address capped off a day of terse tit-for-tat feuding between the president and speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) over the speech and the partial government shutdown, which entered its 33rd day on wednesday.

pelosi earlier wednesday said she would block trump from delivering the state of the union in the house chamber until the government reopens. the president was scheduled to deliver the speech on jan. 29.

in a letter to trump, the democratic leader said she would not move forward with the legislative steps needed for the address to take place, adding that she would invite the president to deliver his speech “on a mutually agreeable date” but only “when government has been opened.”

pelosi's letter came hours after trump informed her in his own letter that he would move ahead and deliver the address at the capitol on the scheduled day, challenging the speaker to scrap his plans.

“nancy pelosi — or nancy, as i call her — she doesn’t want to hear the truth,” trump told reporters at the white house, calling pelosi’s decision “a great, great horrible mark” for the country.

“i don’t believe it’s ever happened before. and it’s always good to be a part of history, but this is a very negative part of history,” he said.

pelosi first invited trump to deliver his address on jan. 3, shortly after reclaiming the speaker’s gavel. she explained her decision to rescind the invitation in the letter to trump, saying “there was no thought that the government would still be shut down” when she invited him to speak.

pelosi requested last week that trump delay his address, citing security concerns related to the shutdown. the department of homeland security and secret service, which develop security plans for the speech, are among the agencies operating without funding.

trump dismissed the speaker's concerns, saying he was told by administration officials that the event would be secure and adding that he wanted to deliver the address as previously scheduled.

“it would be so very sad for our country if the state of the union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!” he wrote.

the shutdown began on dec. 22 amid an impasse between lawmakers and trump over his demand for billions of dollars in border wall funding. the senate on thursday is scheduled to consider two dueling plans to end the shutdown, which has left roughly 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay.

pelosi, responding to trump's announcement late wednesday, said she hoped he would support the house-passed democratic bill that would fund the government through feb. 8.

""mr. president, i hope by saying 'near future' you mean you will support the house-passed package to #endtheshutdown that the senate will vote on tomorrow,"" she tweeted. ""please accept this proposal so we can re-open government, repay our federal workers and then negotiate our differences.""

“what i want is i want these billionaires to stop being freeloaders. i want them to pick up their fair share. that's how we make a system that works not just for the rich and the powerful but works for all of us.”

warren, who is one of several progressive candidates likely seeking the democratic nomination in 2020, proposed a “ultra-millionaire tax,” this weekend for those with a net worth that exceeds $50 million.

A Lobbyist At The Trump Tower Meeting Received Half A Million Dollars In Suspicious Payments,263,an9m5u,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emmaloop/trump-tower-meeting-russian-lobbyist-akhmetshin-suspicious-p,21,1549363552.0,,"alex wong / getty images lobbyist rinat akhmetshin arrives at the us capitol for a meeting with the house intelligence committee.

a russian-born lobbyist who attended the controversial trump tower meeting in june 2016 received a series of suspicious payments totaling half a million dollars before and after the encounter. documents reviewed by buzzfeed news show that rinat akhmetshin, a soviet military officer turned washington lobbyist, deposited large, round-number amounts of cash in the months preceding and following the meeting, where a russian lawyer offered senior trump campaign officials dirt on hillary clinton. the lobbyist also received a large payment that bank investigators deemed suspicious from denis katsyv, whose company prevezon holdings was accused by the us justice department of laundering the proceeds of a $230 million russian tax fraud. the trump tower meeting and those who attended it have become a focus of special counsel robert mueller’s inquiry into whether the president’s campaign colluded with russia to interfere in the 2016 election. as part of that inquiry, banks were asked to pull financial information on the meeting attendees, and investigators at wells fargo handed over documents on akhmetshin to the us treasury in 2017. those records were passed to mueller's team, but peter carr, a spokesperson for the special counsel, declined to say whether the transactions are under investigation. congressional investigators also requested the financial information from the treasury department.

just last month, natalya veselnitskaya, the russian lawyer with whom akhmetshin attended the meeting, was accused by us authorities of secretly coordinating with the russian government while defending katsyv in a money laundering case in new york.

katsyv, the son of a powerful russian figure, backed a lobbying campaign by akhmetshin and veselnitskaya against the magnitsky act, a us law imposing sanctions on a group of russians officials connected to the suspected $230 million fraud. in the months before and after the meeting with the trump campaign, documents show that akhmetshin made unexplained cash deposits totaling $40,000, and received a wire transfer of $100,000 directly from katsyv along with $52,000 from a foundation funded by katsyv and other wealthy russians to try to undermine that law. bankers examining the lobbyist’s accounts flagged these transactions for a variety of reasons, including the inability to explain them, their overseas origin, and a suspicion that they showed akhmetshin had violated federal lobbying law. a half-million dollars of payments to that nonprofit, the human rights accountability global initiative foundation, have also come under scrutiny. wired by katsyv and other backers, the payments came two months before the trump tower meeting. investigators at bank of america, where the foundation held an account, cited the transactions as potential evidence of corruption and bribery in the bid to overturn the sanctions law, and provided them to treasury, documents show. mueller is investigating the foundation, bloomberg reported. bankers at wells fargo said the transactions raised concerns that akhmetshin may have violated the foreign agents registration act (fara) by failing to register as a foreign lobbyist for the network of clients whose money flowed his way. that accusation has been echoed by the chair of the senate judiciary committee, who in 2017 requested information on akhmetshin from the department of justice, which enforces fara. akhmetshin told the associated press that the justice department had contacted him in april 2017 telling him he should have registered under fara. with a broad mandate to investigate any matters that arise during the russia inquiry, the special counsel’s office has given that lobbying regulation new bite. paul manafort, the president’s former campaign chair, and his partner, rick gates, were both charged with violating it and pleaded guilty to charges that encompassed the unregistered foreign lobbying claims. beyond his work with katsyv and veselnitskaya, investigators discovered that akhmetshin had received large, mostly unexplained wire transfers from companies in latvia and panama, and payments from longtime american political insiders, one of whom is a veteran republican operator with ties to the trump campaign. akhmetshin and his lawyers did not respond to multiple requests for comment. reached on his doorstep, the lobbyist told buzzfeed news, “get the fuck out of here, okay?” veselnitskaya also declined to answer questions. “don’t bother with questions,” she told buzzfeed news in russian. “your article is paid for and you have your text ready. don’t be distracted from what you consider the meaning of life.” wells fargo and bank of america declined to comment. on tuesday, a spokesperson for the treasury department said that it was ""working with congressional committees to respond to their requests"" and declined to answer further questions. the senate intelligence committee, which is leading the congressional probes into russian election interference, has scrutinized akhmetshin’s magnitsky-related lobbying work, chair richard burr confirmed to buzzfeed news. “given that the june 9 meeting” — in trump tower, with senior campaign staff — “was about that, i think we’ve explored every possibility relative to that topic,” burr said. asked if the committee has investigated the nonprofit that backed akhmetshin’s lobbying efforts, burr said: “i think everybody’s been of interest to us; every group, every individual that was tied to that.” in testimony before another senate committee, akhmetshin downplayed his role in the trump tower meeting, saying he just happened to be in new york city to see a play, and he showed up in a t-shirt and jeans after receiving a last-minute invitation from veselnitskaya. but that invitation would thrust him to the center of the trump-russia investigation and shine a light on his highly secretive finances. want to help us follow the trump money trail? join us as a buzzfeed news member.

alex wong / getty images akhmetshin spoke with congressional investigators in november 2017.

akhmetshin says it was in late 2015 that he met denis katsyv and his lawyer natalya veselnitskaya. they wanted his help.

the us government had sued katsyv’s company, prevezon holdings, and accused it of being part of a global money laundering machine. federal prosecutors said russian government officials and gangsters had stolen $230 million in a tax refund fraud and used katsyv to funnel some of it through manhattan real estate. akhmetshin is a well-established washington power broker who has worked to advance the agendas of kremlin apparatchiks and influential clients from former soviet states. when they need someone to bend the ear of a us lawmaker, prod a reporter to write a favorable story, or launch a campaign to discredit their enemies, they turn to akhmetshin — and pay him handsomely. so when prevezon hired a powerful us law firm, akhmetshin was brought on to review documents, he testified to the senate judiciary committee. the firm was bakerhostetler, which investigators at wells fargo found paid him $97,400 over five months. the payments were flagged along with the others in akhmetshin’s account as evidence that he might have violated fara. bakerhostetler did not return a request for comment. akhmetshin said an old friend was also working on the case: ed lieberman, a washington attorney with a wealth of experience on matters related to russia and post-soviet states. lieberman and akhmetshin have known each other for more than two decades, akhmetshin said, and the duo worked on behalf of organizations connected to a former kazakh prime minister. fusion gps, the washington research firm that commissioned the famous trump dossier, was also hired to conduct research. it was during this time that katsyv and veselnitskaya asked akhmetshin to go a step further. they wanted him to help them change us legislation bearing the magnitsky name. the first magnitsky law, passed in 2012, was named after sergei magnitsky, a russian tax lawyer who was reportedly tortured to death in prison after uncovering the massive fraud. the law placed sanctions on powerful russians for their involvement in magnitsky’s death and the vast scheme that katsyv stood accused of abetting. now, the us congress was set to pass a second magnitsky act targeting human rights abusers worldwide. akhmetshin said he told katsyv and veselnitskaya that he had discovered “inconsistencies” in magnitsky’s story while working on the prevezon case. “they asked me what was my advice, and as a long-time d.c. resident, i know there’s nothing better like taking these things to the hill,” akhmetshin told the senate judiciary committee. akhmetshin received his final check from bakerhostetler in march 2016. that same month, he deposited $20,000 cash into his account, the first in a series of cash deposits totaling $78,900 that his bank flagged as suspicious because there was no way to determine their origin or purpose. in april, akhmetshin registered to lobby — though not as a foreign agent — on behalf of the human rights accountability global initiative foundation, a delaware nonprofit that rented office space in the same building as bakerhostetler’s washington offices. akhmetshin told congressional investigators the foundation was established by lawyers for katsyv.

emma loop / buzzfeed news the human rights accountability global initiative foundation set up offices in this washington office building.

akhmetshin wrote in his lobbying registration that he would be working on “international adoptions.” that innocent-sounding issue had become a battleground between russia and the us, with putin exacting revenge for the sanctions levied under the magnitsky act by blocking us adoptions of russian children. resuming the adoptions and criticizing the sanctions were among veselnitskaya’s talking points at the trump tower meeting — to the disappointment of trump campaign officials who had come in search of information about clinton. the same month akhmetshin registered to lobby for the foundation, katsyv and two of his business partners, plus a russian bank executive and a company registered in the british virgin islands, sent a series of wire transfers totaling nearly $500,000 to the nonprofit’s account. examiners at bank of america later turned a record of these transactions over to us treasury officials, alerting them that the payments could be evidence of bribery or political corruption related to the magnitsky act. the examiners noted it was odd that all five of the deposits happened so close to one another — and not long before the trump tower meeting. at wells fargo, officials noted that akhmetshin received $52,686 from the foundation. the amount is at least $30,000 more than he declared earning on lobbying disclosure forms that year. akhmetshin canvassed capitol hill, telling lawmakers that the stories they heard about magnitsky and russian money-laundering were wrong. the foundation also hired cozen o’connor, a high-powered us lobbying firm, and the late democratic rep. ron dellums. a spokesperson for cozen o’connor did not answer questions from buzzfeed news. ""the substance of our brief engagement with hragif is disclosed in our lobbying disclosure act filings,"" the firm’s spokesperson said. veselnitskaya says she worked as an advisor to the foundation, while lieberman came on board as its legal advisor, akhmetshin said. akhmetshin and dellums spent may 2016 looking for sympathetic members of the house foreign affairs committee, which was working on the new magnitsky law. “i had a ton of people that the russians sent through my office to feed me a bunch of bullshit,” rep. jim mcgovern, a democrat on the committee who worked on the legislation, told buzzfeed news. there was no talk of adoptions when akhmetshin and dellums got the attention of democratic rep. gregory meeks, another member of the committee, outside his office. “this was magnitsky,” meeks said.

house foreign affairs committee veselnitskaya won a coveted seat at a hearing on russia thanks to one of akhmetshin's associates, lanny wiles, according to the washington post.

by the early summer, veselnitskaya was working on a far more audacious approach. the lawyer was busy setting up a meeting in manhattan with trump’s top campaign officials, including his son donald trump jr; his son-in-law, jared kushner; and his campaign chair manafort. trump jr. said that when he got to the trump tower meeting with the russians, he quickly realized that veselnitskaya had little of the promised dirt on hillary clinton. “it was clear to me that her real purpose in asking for the meeting all along was to discuss russian adoptions and the magnitsky act,” he told the senate judiciary committee in september 2017. “i proceeded to quickly and politely end the meeting by telling ms. veselnitskaya that because my father was a private citizen there did not seem to be any point for having this discussion.” akhmetshin made the second large, round-number cash deposit into his account two months later, in august. bank examiners flagged the $20,000 deposit as suspicious because they could not determine the origin of the funds. the lobbyist also received his final check from the human rights accountability global initiative foundation that month. efforts to change the new magnitsky act had failed. in december 2016, the us passed the expanded legislation, and a few days later, akhmetshin filed paperwork saying he was no longer lobbying for the foundation. but payments from those connected to the foundation didn’t stop. akhmetshin continued receiving checks and wires from wiles consulting, a florida-based company controlled by lanny wiles, a longtime republican operator. those payments, which began in january 2016, extended to april 2017, and totaled $72,500. investigators at akhmetshin’s bank said the direction of the payments — from wiles to akhmetshin — contrasted with how their working relationship had been portrayed publicly. investigators, citing unspecified public information, said wiles claimed he was paid by akhmetshin to work on the magnitsky lobbying issue, not the other way around. the investigators did not cite their source, but a 2016 politico article quoted wiles saying he had been paid by akhmetshin. investigators at bank of america did find that the foundation had issued checks to wiles, but the amount is unclear. wiles, whose wife was the chair of trump’s florida campaign, did not return messages seeking comment. in the same politico article, wiles said he didn’t want to register as a foreign agent, but that akhmetshin had told him it wouldn’t be necessary, as he would be working for bakerhostetler. fara offers several exemptions, including one for those representing foreign individuals or entities in a legal capacity. however, the exemption “has several technical requirements and has been interpreted by doj relatively narrowly in the past,” said dan pickard, a dc lawyer who specializes in fara. another exemption allows those representing foreigners to register under the less stringent lobbying disclosure act, as akhmetshin did. “however, this exemption is not applicable if the agent is working for a foreign principal that is either a government of a foreign country or a foreign political party,” pickard said. in august 2017, akhmetshin made a third cash deposit into his account, this time for $22,900. again, bank investigators could not readily explain the deposit. that same month, the financial times reported, akhmetshin testified before a grand jury in mueller’s investigation. akhmetshin received another wire transfer in october 2017 — this time directly from katsyv, whose father, pyotr katsyv, is vice president of the state-owned russian railways and a former transportation minister. representatives for pyotr katsyv did not return a detailed message. pyotr katsyv was recently revealed to have been involved, at least peripherally, in his son’s us money laundering case. in december 2018, veselnitskaya was indicted on obstruction of justice charges for allegedly helping the russian government draft a document claiming that magnitsky was the true perpetrator of the massive tax fraud. prevezon, which veselnitskaya defended, submitted the document in court as evidence. veselnitskaya emailed drafts of the document to “a supervising russian prosecutor in the russian prosecutor general’s office,” the indictment says, and in one case copied the “father of the owner of real estate company 1” — identifiable as the senior katsyv. the $100,000 from denis katsyv to akhmetshin was listed only as payment for consulting work, the documents show. given what was already known at the time about akhmetshin’s work on the magnitsky act and prevezon case, bankers listed the transaction as another example of his alleged undeclared foreign lobbying. veselnitskaya, who has represented katsyv, did not answer questions for the prevezon owner. investigators at wells fargo reviewed the previous two years of akhmetshin’s account activity in search of evidence that could be helpful to mueller’s inquiry. one of the earliest transactions they flagged was a $30,000 wire from a company based in latvia. examiners said the transaction referenced a short-term loan, but they could find little information about the company. bankers labelled the transaction, like other wires into akhmetshin’s account, as suspicious because it came from overseas and could be connected to akhmetshin’s alleged undeclared foreign lobbying. the company was laudato sia, a firm connected to igor pobereschski, a russian-german lobbyist. pobereschski did not answer detailed questions from buzzfeed news. a couple months later, in july 2015, a panamanian shell company called egh international had wired akhmetshin $17,774 for what it listed as travel expense reimbursement, examiners found. they could find little other public information about egh international, either. investigators at wells fargo noted that beginning in january 2015, akhmetshin began collecting checks from his old friend lieberman as well, totaling $52,000 by june 2017. investigators said one of the checks appeared to reference a rich russian business owner. lieberman did not return requests for comment. meanwhile, akhmetshin cashed two checks, worth a total of $7,500, related to another foreign entity — one from an institute he told congress is “centered around” the former kazakh prime minister and another from a dc lawyer who has represented him in the us. wells fargo and bank of america submitted their findings to the treasury department in early november 2017. by then, congress was scrutinizing akhmetshin, too. the senate judiciary and house intelligence committees questioned akhmetshin that month. the senate intelligence committee interviewed akhmetshin in the fall of 2017, a source close to the committee confirmed to buzzfeed news. the senate intelligence and judiciary committees both requested financial documents on akhmetshin, but it’s unclear what, exactly, they have gotten. burr, the intelligence committee chair, has said his panel has received “every financial document” requested from treasury. a source familiar with the house intelligence committee’s russia investigation said akhmetshin’s aggressive hill lobbying came up during the probe, but was not looked at in great detail. republicans on the committee shuttered its russia investigation last year, but democrats have retaken control of the house, allowing them to reopen the inquiry."

sen. bernie sanders of vermont is giving it another go, launching a second campaign for the white house four years after surprising democrats with a strong bid for the party's 2016 nomination.

""we began the political revolution in the 2016 campaign, and now it's time to move that revolution forward,"" the independent senator told vermont public radio in an interview airing tuesday morning.

but this 2020 bid will undoubtedly be a very different presidential campaign than his quest for the democratic nomination as an underdog in 2016. sanders enters the race as a top contender who, along with former vice president joe biden, tops most early polls, far outpacing other democratic candidates in support and name identification.

it's a sharp contrast from when sanders seemingly came out of nowhere to surprise the political class — and at times himself — by winning several key primaries against former secretary of state hillary clinton. buoyed by a big early win in new hampshire, sanders fought clinton for the democratic nomination through the final june contests, drawing tens of thousands of supporters to rallies in the process.

in the years since his loss to clinton, sanders has remained a national leader of the democratic party, though he still refuses to join.

""i think we have had real success in moving the ideology of the democratic party to be a pro-worker party, to stand up to the billionaire class,"" sanders told npr during the 2018 midterms. ""we've got a long way to go.""

many of the issues he has promoted for years — most notably a medicare-for-all national health care plan and a $15 an hour minimum wage — have shifted from the party's fringe to its mainstream, and are now seen as effective litmus tests for presidential candidates.

indeed, sanders' most recent medicare-for-all bill was cosponsored by fellow presidential candidates sens. kamala harris, kirsten gillibrand, cory booker and elizabeth warren. the senate's other presidential candidate, amy klobuchar, co-sponsored sanders' most recent $15 minimum wage bill, in addition to the other four.

sanders pointed to the democratic party's leftward shift as a reason for a second run. ""it turns out that many of the ideas that i talked about — that health care is a right, not a privilege, and that we've got to move toward a medicare-for-all, single-payer system: very, very popular. the idea that we have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour,"" he told vermont public radio. ""when i talked about making public colleges and universities tuition-free and lowering student debt, that was another issue that people said was too radical. well, that's also happening around the country.""

but running in 2020, sanders could be a victim of his own success.

while sanders provided liberal democratic primary voters with a sharp contrast to clinton's political pragmatism in 2016, progressives will have no shortage of candidates to choose from in the increasingly broad and diverse 2020 field.

most declared democrats support sanders' vision of nationalized health care, and more robust federal programs and policies, all funded by higher taxes on top income earners.

and in a party that has placed an increasing premium on being more representative of the broader electorate and country in recent years, many other candidates will offer voters the 77-year-old's platform — with the added benefit of youth and diversity.

""my question is, does he provide added value in this campaign for 2020? or are there a lot of people who sort of carry very similar messages? does it have to be him? i don't think it does, and i admire him,"" new hampshire radio host arnie arnesen, a 2016 sanders supporter, recently told npr. ""i think it's time for us to start creating a new bench. and the new bench isn't old, it shouldn't be white and it probably shouldn't be male.""

asked by vermont public radio how he will pitch his candidacy in such a diverse and progressive field, sanders argued, ""we have got to look at candidates not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or gender and not by their age. i think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society that looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.""

there have been hurdles as sanders prepared to run again in 2020. his campaign has had to answer to charges of sexism and harassment by staffers in 2016, with his former campaign manager acknowledging ""a failure."" sanders also had to clarify comments about the role of racism in the 2018 campaign, addressing the losses of gubernatorial candidates andrew gillum in florida and stacey abrams in georgia.

sanders took several steps to maintain his national political profile and strengthen his presidential prospects in recent years, including his support for democratic candidates in 2018.

frequently criticized by the clinton campaign during 2016 for ignoring foreign policy, he delivered several high-profile speeches laying out a progressive worldview that attempts to thread the needle between a broad, america-as-world-police approach to international politics, and president trump's isolationist views.

sanders also played a lead role opposing republican attempts to repeal the affordable care act and engaged with the democratic national committee that famously opposed his 2016 campaign, as revealed in internal emails stolen by russian hackers and posted to wikileaks.

in the wake of the 2016 campaign, the dnc changed its presidential nominating process, in part by largely removing party leaders known as ""superdelegates"" from influencing the selection, a move sanders supported."
The Frenzied Search for Racism: Elites bought Jussie Smollett’s story because it confirmed their cherished narrative about a hateful America.,3,asrdao,https://www.city-journal.org/jussie-smollett-bigotry,4,1550714158.0,,"the jussie smollett case, in which a young black, gay actor has apparently concocted a tale of being attacked by two white men wearing maga hats and shouting anti-gay slurs, is just the latest example of how desperately media elites want to confirm their favored narrative about america: that the country is endemically and lethally racist, sexist, and homophobic, and that the election of donald trump both proves and reinforces such bigotry.

the truth: as instances of actual racism get harder and harder to find, the search to find such bigotry becomes increasingly frenzied and unmoored from reality.

smollett made a not-irrational wager that a patently preposterous narrative about an anti-black, anti-gay hate crime at 2 a.m. in subzero chicago would be embraced by virtually the entirety of the mainstream media, leading democratic politicians, hollywood, and academia, with no one in these cohorts bothering to fact-check his narrative or entertain even armchair skepticism toward it. he also presumed, again with good reason, that to claim victim status would catapult him to the highest echelons of public admiration and accomplishment. and he was right. kamala harris and cory booker called it a “modern-day lynching.” joe biden warned that “we must no longer give this hate safe harbor,” his implication being that we need to stop winking at such racist attacks. if beale street could talk’s barry jenkins lamented, “this what all that hateful mongering has wrought. are you proud???” good morning america interviewed smollett without asking a single critical question about his story.

the examples are as numerous as the retractions will be minimal.

even the chicago police department was reluctant to express any skepticism toward the smollett narrative until it had overwhelming evidence of the hoax, since to question the ubiquity of racism today is to invite accusations of racism. yet the cpd, along with their law enforcement brethren, are surely aware of what the data say regarding hate crimes. in 2017, the fbi reported an additional 1,000 hate crimes from 2016, for a total of 7,000. but an additional 1,000 police agencies participated in hate-crime reporting in 2017, as reason’s robby soave has pointed out, so it’s not clear that that increase is real or simply a result of more reporting. even if real, 7,000 “hate crimes” in a country this large is an infinitesimal number. and the definition of a hate crime is highly political: very little black-on-white street crime gets classified as such, though hatred for whites undoubtedly drives a considerable fraction of this activity. (between 2012 and 2015, blacks committed more than 85 percent of interracial violent victimizations between blacks and whites.)

the smollett case is a rerun of the covington hoax, which mobilized an identical longing on the part of the media and political elites to confirm the narrative of american racism, now exacerbated in the era of trump. native american activist nathan phillips concocted an outright lie about his interaction with the covington catholic high school students, and he, too, became an instant, revered celebrity. then as now, public figure after public figure announced that maga hats were the very symbol of white supremacy. alyssa milano declared that “the maga hat is the new white hood.” new york times columnist charles blow called maga hats the “new iconography of white supremacy.” other recent credulously received phony claims of white racism include the jazmine barnes case in houston and racial-profiling charges against a south carolina cop. andy ngo has collected many more. now that smollett’s story is falling apart, he is clinging to his victim identity any way he can: his lawyers say that he feels “victimized” by reports that he played a role in the assault.

the smollett and covington cases, and others, are grounded in the #believesurvivors mantra of the kavanaugh hearings: the left demands utter credence toward any claim of racism and sexism, and the merest act of questioning these claims or trying to pin down details is regarded as hateful. anti-racism—preferably of a performative nature—is now the national religion of white elites, who would rather blame themselves (and the deplorables) for nonexistent racism than speak honestly about the behavioral problems and academic skills gaps that lead to ongoing socioeconomic disparities. the senate just passed an anti-lynching bill, backed by senators kamala harris, cory booker, and tim scott—as if lynchings were a fact of our current reality. don’t be surprised if democrats appropriate funding for a new underground railroad.

the current anti-racist frenzy is the product of a poisoned academic culture that has declared war on western civilization and that teaches students, more than anything else, how to hate—to hate the greatest accomplishments of our civilization, to hate america, and to hate one another.

we continue to play with fire.

"Report: Michael Cohen plans to publicly accuse Trump of criminal conduct in office, during dramatic testimony before Congress",420,auz29y,https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-cohen-trump-criminal-conduct-in-office-wsj-report-2019-2,109,1551213931.0,,"michael cohen is gearing up to testify before congress on wednesday regarding his relationship with president donald trump.

democrats on the house oversight committee plan to question cohen on a wide array of subjects, including several hush-money payments made to women during the 2016 election, as well as trump's business dealings, according to an internal committee memo seen by insider.

cohen, meanwhile, will accuse the president of engaging in criminal conduct while in office, the wall street journal reported. the accusations are related to the hush-money payment cohen facilitated to the porn star stormy daniels in exchange for her silence about an affair she says she had with trump, which trump denies.

the journal quoted a source as saying cohen also planned to provide evidence of ""lies, racism, and cheating"" by trump.

cohen has never publicly accused trump of criminal conduct while serving as president.

michael cohen, president donald trump's former lawyer and longtime fixer, is gearing up this week for three consecutive days of testimony before congress.

on tuesday, he will appear before the senate intelligence committee for a closed-door hearing, and he will have a second closed-door hearing before the house intelligence committee on thursday.

but by far the most highly anticipated is cohen's scheduled testimony before the house oversight committee, which is slated to take place wednesday in a public setting.

according to an internal committee memo seen by insider, democrats on the panel plan to question cohen extensively about several hush-money payments made during the 2016 election to women who said they had affairs with trump. the president denies the affairs and initially denied knowing anything about the payments.

cohen, meanwhile, plans to accuse trump of engaging in criminal conduct while in office, the wall street journal reported tuesday.

the accusations are related to a hush-money payment that cohen facilitated to stormy daniels, the porn star who says she had an affair with trump about a decade ago, the journal reported.

the journal story cited an unnamed person familiar with cohen's planned testimony to congress on wednesday.

the source did not offer other specifics about what the accusation entailed.

such testimony would mark the first time cohen accused trump of criminal conduct while serving as president. but cohen has previously implicated trump in campaign finance violations. in december, during cohen's sentencing hearing, a federal judge also said in open court that trump had directed his then-lawyer to commit a felony during the election.

democrats on the house oversight committee also plan to question cohen extensively about trump's business dealings and his compliance with tax laws, according to the internal memo. cohen is expected to provide some of trump's private financial statements to the committee and give what the journal described as ""behind-the-scenes"" details of working for the president.

he will say trump at times inflated or deflated his net worth for business and personal purposes, including the avoidance of property taxes, the journal reported.

he also reportedly plans to provide evidence of ""lies, racism, and cheating"" by trump, including allegedly racist remarks about african-americans' intelligence and lifestyle choices.

cohen has pleaded guilty to multiple federal crimes in two separate investigations. last year, he pleaded guilty to tax evasion, bank fraud, and campaign finance violations as part of a manhattan us attorney's office investigation into his and trump's business dealings before the election.

he also later pleaded guilty in the special counsel robert mueller's russia investigation to one count of lying to congress about the now defunct trump tower moscow project.

though the president initially defended cohen following an fbi raid on his property, the white house subsequently began distancing itself from trump's longtime lawyer and fixer. cohen reportedly felt betrayed by the president and decided to cooperate with prosecutors soon after.

cohen served as the trump organization's lead lawyer for over a decade before leaving the company in 2017 to be trump's personal lawyer. his proximity to trump, as well as his elevated position on the campaign and in trump's personal life, makes him one of the most dangerous cooperators against the president to date, legal scholars told insider last year.

white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders lashed out at the journal's report on tuesday morning, calling cohen a ""disgraced felon"" and saying it was ""laughable"" that people would listen to his ""lies.""

the president and his associates have frequently characterized cohen as a liar since the lawyer stopped working for the president. republican lawmakers on the house oversight committee also plan to paint cohen as a liar whose statements can't be trusted.

but legal experts said their attacks may be undermined if cohen can support his allegations with documentary evidence, as he reportedly plans to do.

cohen is due to begin serving a three-year prison sentence on march 6 over an array of financial crimes and after he pleaded guilty to one count of lying to congress about various aspects of the trump tower moscow deal when he testified before the house intelligence committee in 2017."
"An explosive exposé of a $9 billion Russian money-laundering operation entangles Citigroup, Raiffeisen, and Deutsche Bank",590,axnhrj,https://www.businessinsider.com/expos-on-russian-money-laundering-operation-entangles-banks-2019-3,71,1551834556.0,[deleted],"a group of investigative journalists have published their findings on what they are calling ""the troika laundromat,"" described as a $9 billion money-laundering operation with links to politicians and russia's largest private investment bank.

the investigative-journalism group the organized crime and corruption reporting project worked with others including the lithuanian news site 15min.lt and the guardian for the project.

journalists said the project represented one of the largest banking leaks ever and entangled western banks including the us-based citigroup, the austria-based raiffeisen, and the germany-based deutsche bank.

the explosive report sent shares of raiffeisen tumbling 14% in tuesday trading. the bank says it is opening an internal investigation.

a group of investigative journalists have uncovered what they describe as a $9 billion money-laundering operation enabled by russia's largest private investment bank, troika dialog.

the operation, in which billions were said to be funneled from shell companies into the global banking system, was uncovered by the organized crime and corruption reporting project and the lithuanian news site 15min.lt using leaked data shared with others including the guardian.

the journalists said the data used in their reporting represented one of the largest leaks of banking information ever, ""involving more than $470 billion sent in 1.3 million leaked transactions from 233,000 companies.""

the occrp said the russian operation, which it called ""the troika laundromat,"" was active in syphoning an estimated $4.8 billion into europe and the us from 2006 to early 2013 and was formed by at least 75 interconnected offshore companies.

those companies generated $8.8 billion worth of internal transactions to help hide the cash's origins, the report said.

""the laundromat allowed russian oligarchs and politicians to secretly acquire shares in state-owned companies, to buy real estate both in russia and abroad, to purchase luxury yachts, to hire music superstars for private parties, to pay medical bills, and much more,"" the occrp said in a release on its website.

""to protect themselves, the wealthy people behind this system used the identities of poor people as unwitting signatories in the secretive offshore companies that ran the system.""

the occrp said ruben vardanyan, then troika dialog's president, chief executive, and principal partner, denied wrongdoing by the bank. it also said reporters found no evidence that vardanyan specifically had been accused of wrongdoing.

raiffeisen stock tanks

the occrp said that funds were eventually distributed through a series of major western banks, including the us-based citigroup, the austria-based raiffeisen, and the germany-based deutsche bank. the explosive report sent shares of raiffeisen tumbling 14% in tuesday trading.

raiffeisen, in a comment to business insider, said it was conducting an internal investigation:

""raiffeisen bank international (rbi) is not familiar with the concrete allegations and does not have any further information on the content of the complaint. rbi complies with all anti-money laundering requirements. its compliance systems and processes have been, and continue to be, regularly reviewed by external parties and are confirmed to be in compliance with the legal requirements.""

in an emailed statement to business insider, deutsche bank said:

""deutsche bank's clients are so-called respondent banks. it is first and foremost the task of the respondent bank to check its customers in accordance with the applicable know-your-customer regulations.""

citigroup declined to comment.

the investigation goes right to the top of russian politics, with links to russian president vladimir putin's friends and business associates.

prince charles link

among the reporting from the guardian is that in 2009, 2010, and 2011, three transfers totaling $200,000 from one of the shell companies linked to the scandal went to a fundraising vehicle for prince charles.

the money was reportedly used to help prince charles rescue a stately home in scotland called dumfries house from being auctioned off.

there is no suggestion that recipients such as prince charles were aware of the original source of such money, and the guardian noted that in some cases legitimate money might have entered the system.

the prince of wales' charitable foundation and the dumfries house trust ""apply robust due diligence processes in accordance with charity commission and scottish charity regulator guidelines as well as legislation relating to money laundering, the bribery act, terrorism and political activity,"" a spokesman for prince charles' charities told business insider in an emailed statement. ""in the case of the examples highlighted, no red flags arose during those processes."""

mentioning queen esther, who according to jewish scripture convinced the king of persia not to massacre the jewish people, cbn's middle east bureau chief, chris mitchell, asked pompeo whether there were similarities between her and trump.

""could it be that president trump right now has been raised for such a time, just like queen esther, to help save the jewish people from an iranian menace?""

""as a christian i certainly believe that's possible,"" pompeo responded. ""i am confident that the lord is at work here.""

trump's policies as president have been notably tough on iran and favorable to the jewish state of israel.

last year, trump withdrew from the iranian nuclear agreement, a move that garnered international backlash. trump also reimposed numerous sanctions on iran that have hit the country's economy hard.

trump has also officially moved the us embassy in israel to jerusalem, a symbolic move that critics say emboldens israeli claims to jerusalem while minimizing palestinian claims.

trump on thursday also said it was time for the us to recognize the golan heights, one of the globe's most disputed territories, as part of israel."
The US Is Holding Hundreds Of Shivering Immigrants In A Pen Underneath A Texas Bridge,163,b7e8o4,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/border-bridge-migrants-detained-camp-el-paso-texas,79,1553998757.0,,"us immigration officials are holding hundreds of people in a temporary outdoor detention camp under a texas bridge, where migrants are surrounded by fencing and sleeping on dirt.

ivan pierre aguirre for buzzfeed news families are seen inside a temporary migrant holding area set up by customs and border protection under the paso del norte international port of entry between juarez, mexico, and el paso, march 27, 2019, in el paso, texas.

el paso, texas — hundreds of migrants being held in an outdoor camp underneath a bridge that connects the us and mexico told buzzfeed news that had they known they’d face such harsh conditions at the texas border before they left, they may not have made the journey. the immigrants, held behind a chain-link fence topped with razor wire, said they’ve endured cold and windy nights sleeping on bare, rocky dirt underneath the paso del norte international bridge that links ciudad juarez and el paso. most of the immigrants had nothing but thin, mylar blankets. above, roosting pigeons dropped feces on them. us immigration officials said they have been overwhelmed by the influx of migrant families trying to enter the country, filling facilities to capacity, and forcing officials to temporarily house people under the bridge in what they describe as a transitional shelter. on thursday morning, as cars and travelers went back and forth across the two border cities on the bridge above, a group of immigrant men and a young boy talked and pointed to the razor wire that encircled them. behind them was a line of portable toilets. on the floor were the metallic-looking plastic blankets they were given to brave the shivering cold. reporters were able to view immigrants inside the pen for a brief time before border patrol agents asked that they leave the area. several immigrants at a nearby greyhound bus station said they spent nights under the bridge before they were released pending scheduled appearances before immigration judges. n. rosales, a woman from honduras who crossed into the us with her son, spent about three days under the bridge until she was moved to a border patrol holding cell at the adjacent processing facility. she asked that her full name or age not be used, fearing retaliation from immigration authorities. officials installed a large tent underneath the bridge, but it wasn’t large enough to hold everyone. those who couldn’t fit inside the tent slept outside on the ground littered with rocks, rosales said. whether they were inside or outside the tent, rosales said people had to sleep on the gravel.

ivan pierre aguirre for buzzfeed news

immigration agents would wake them up before sunrise for breakfast, she said. “i see it as a punishment for entering the country illegally,” rosales told buzzfeed news. “time moved so slow, it seemed like an eternity.” four other immigrants at the greyhound station in el paso who were waiting for a bus to miami, chicago, or boston corroborated the description of the conditions, but declined to use their names out of fear of authorities. andrew meehan, cbp assistant commissioner for public affairs, said border patrol had issued warnings for several months that ""the immigration system is broken"" and at ""critical capacity levels"" along the southern border. ""cbp’s facilities and manpower cannot support this dramatic increase in apprehensions of family units and unaccompanied children,"" meehan said in a statement to buzzfeed news. ""usbp temporary holding facilities were simply not designed to process and care for a population of this size and of this demographic."" meehan said the number of families and children has forced cbp to seek every possible temporary solution to house, process, and care for people in their custody. the agency said it was providing full-time, onsite medical providers, as well as blankets, access to shower facilities, water, three meals a day with additional snacks, restrooms, and access to telephones. nearly every sector across the southwest border has exceeded their capacity, meehan said. as a result border patrol has begun processing ""non-criminal"" families for immediate release under their own recognizance.

border patrol facilities at or over 100% capacity: el paso 283% - 3,426 in custody rio grande valley 174% - 5,355 in custody yuma 149% - 522 in custody rio grande valley centralized processing center 132% - 1,977 in custody rvg mcallen station 358% - 1,369 in custody

roger maier, a spokesperson for cbp, previously said officials set up the enclosure and tent underneath the bridge because of the large number of apprehensions in the area.

“as illegal aliens arrive at the processing facility, they are placed at the ‘tent’ to await their turn to be processed,” maier said in a statement. “this tent serves only as a transitional shelter and is not a temporary housing facility. it was established within the last month.” the images of women, men, and children detained by authorities under the paso del norte bridge were seen after kevin mcaleenan, the commissioner of cbp, held a press conference nearby to discuss the “unprecedented humanitarian crisis” the agency was facing as more unaccompanied minors and a record number of families arrive. immigration officials said they’ve been overwhelmed by the number of central american children and families they are holding in facilities originally built to detain single mexican immigrants. in the past, cbp would turn over migrants apprehended at the border to immigration and customs enforcement — but both agencies said they don’t have the space to hold the number of people they’re seeing at the border. as a result, officials said, border patrol has been forced to directly release migrant families in texas’s rio grande valley instead of waiting for ice to pick them up. a border patrol official said the agency was planning to expand the practice of directly releasing migrant families to other areas of the border in el paso, yuma, san diego, and possibly del rio because of overcapacity at facilities. m. gonzalez, a honduran who crossed the border with his teenage brother and asked that his full name not be used, said riding on “the beast” — a system of freight trains migrants use to traverse mexico quickly — was easier than the conditions they faced under the bridge. the train is infamous for the number of lives and limbs it has claimed from migrants who fall off or are attacked by criminals. “it’s hell there,” gonzalez told buzzfeed news. “the bridge is one of the worst things i’ve ever experienced.”

gonzalez, who spent about four days under the bridge, said the wind would funnel underneath it at night, making it feel dramatically colder. their lips would chap and crack, he said, pointing to the pieces of peeling skin on his lips. droppings from the pigeons perched on the inside of the bridge fell on detainees, he said. gonzalez said kids were constantly crying and some looked like they were about to faint. “i regretted coming,” gonzalez said. “i’m not sure i would’ve come if i had known.” during the days they could hear shouts from people they assumed were walking overhead. “you’re not alone.” “you’re with god.” others were less supportive. “you’re not welcomed.” “go back to your country.”

not everything was so horrible. the portable toilets were clean, the walls around them disinfected, and the water at the plastic portable sinks to wash their hands was refilled. rosales and gonzalez said that before they made the journey to the us, they didn’t hear from friends or family who had successfully entered about the conditions they faced in detention. rosales thinks people are too ashamed to describe their experience. then again, she said, some migrants are so desperate that warnings about conditions in immigration detention would do little to stop them. gonzalez said he had been told by undocumented people in the us it was safe to make the journey and nothing bad would happen to him. “they said they let people with children pass,” gonzalez said. after spending days under the bridge, gonzalez said he would be forthcoming with others back home about his journey. “i’d tell people what it’s like,” he said. “if they want to risk it, that’s on them.”"
Second woman claims Biden once touched her inappropriately,185,b8cd1q,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/436767-woman-says-biden-touched-her-inappropriately-rubbed-noses-at-2009,74,1554196124.0,[deleted],"a connecticut woman said monday that joe biden joe biden republican philadelphia official responsible for vote counting says office getting death threats biden will call governors, mayors about mask mandate trump campaign voter fraud hotline flooded with prank calls more touched her inappropriately and rubbed noses with her while at a 2009 political fundraiser in greenwich, the second such allegation against the former vice president in the past week.

""it wasn’t sexual, but he did grab me by the head,"" amy lappos told the hartford courant on monday.

she said that she never filed a complaint about the interaction but believes biden crossed a line.

""i never filed a complaint, to be honest, because he was the vice president. i was a nobody,"" lappos told the courant. ""there’s absolutely a line of decency. there’s a line of respect. crossing that line is not grandfatherly. it’s not cultural. it’s not affection. it’s sexism or misogyny.""

a spokesperson for biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the alleged incident.

biden is widely expected to enter the 2020 presidential race soon, and allegations of inappropriate behavior could torpedo his campaign.

lappos decided to come forward with her story after former nevada state assemblywoman lucy flores (d) alleged friday that biden had inappropriately touched and kissed her.

flores wrote that at campaign rally supporting her bid for lieutenant governor in 2014, biden put his hands on her shoulders, sniffed her hair and kissed her on the back of her head.

""the vice-president of the united states of america had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family, or romantic partners — and i felt powerless to do anything about it,"" she wrote in an op-ed published on friday.

biden responded to that allegation on sunday, saying, ""in my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, i have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. and not once — never — did i believe i acted inappropriately.""

""if it is suggested i did so, i will listen respectfully. but it was never my intention,"" he added.

on monday, a spokesperson for biden pushed back strongly in a message to reporters against the ""cottage industry of lies"" he said has formed about the former vice president supposedly crossing a line between affectionate and inappropriate in multiple incidents, warning that context is important."
"Trump claims he suffers 'highest level of Presidential Harassment in history', despite assassination of four predecessors",487,b9d62h,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-twitter-harassment-president-assassination-jfk-lincoln-a8854811.html,249,1554415712.0,,"donald trump has claimed he suffers the “highest level” of presidential harassment in american history, despite four of his predecessors having been assassinated.

“there is nothing we can ever give to the democrats that will make them happy,” he wrote on twitter. ”this is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country!”

mr trump’s claim came despite the fact that four previous presidents have been killed, and two more were shot but survived. almost all recent presidents have undergone the same kind of legal challenges and investigations that mr trump is objecting to.

the president and his aides have repeatedly attempted to claim that he is being subjected to “presidential harassment”. for months, republicans have been suggesting that it is wrong to ask questions of the president and, mr trump claimed that asking questions of the president ”really does hurt our country”.

the new tweet came amid his continuing objection to democrats who are asking to see the full mueller report, in an attempt to understand any wrongdoing that it may have uncovered. it was posted very soon after another post in which he said that “few people seem to care” about alleged collusion with russians and that his opponents should turn their attention elsewhere.

“according to polling, few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax, but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive,” he wrote in that earlier tweet. ”they should focus on legislation or, even better, an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started – so illegal!”

in a similar post to the one in which he suggested he is being harassed more than presidents who died in office, sent two days earlier, he had made the same suggestion that nothing would satisfy democrats on that russia probe.

“in 1998, rep.jerry nadler strongly opposed the release of the starr report on bill clinton,” he wrote in that tweet. “no information whatsoever would or could be legally released. but with the no collusion mueller report, which the dems hate, he wants it all. nothing will ever satisfy them!”"
"A New Study Confirms (Again) That Race, Not Economics, Drove Former Democrats to Trump",114,bj3tgb,https://psmag.com/news/new-study-confirms-again-that-race-not-economics-drove-former-democrats-to-trump,149,1556662574.0,[deleted],"research on iowa counties that swung from obama to trump indicates that gop success was driven far more by sexism and racism than by economic anxiety.

some disproven theories simply refuse to die. among them is the notion that president donald trump's 2016 victory was largely due to economic anxiety on the part of blue-collar whites.

democratic presidential hopeful pete buttigieg has made that argument repeatedly of late, citing ""the failure of this enormous american prosperity to reach so many people in so many communities,"" and trump's promises of radical change, as the reasons for the president's upset win.

but a major study published a year ago found that trump's support among non-college-educated whites—arguably the key to his electoral college success—was driven far more by sexism and racism than by economic anxiety.

now, a new study that focuses on one key constituency—white people in iowa who voted for barack obama, and later for trump—comes to that same conclusion.

""economic distress is not a significant factor in explaining the shift in iowa voters from democrat to republican between 2008 and 2016,"" write iowa state university sociologists ann oberhauser, daniel krier, and abdi kusow. ""the election outcomes do not signify [a revolt] among working-class voters left behind by globalization.""

rather, in 2016, ""the nativist narrative about 'taking back america' and anti-immigrant sentiment became stronger forces than economic issues,"" oberhauser said in announcing the findings.

the study, published in the journal sociological quarterly, begins by noting that 31 iowa counties flipped from democrat to republican between 2008 and 2016—more counties than in any other state. for each county, researchers calculated the percentage of difference between the vote for the republican ticket of john mccain/sarah palin and that for trump/mike pence eight years later.

the researchers noted the ""level of rurality"" for each county, a metric that the federal department of agriculture calculates using the size of a given county's population and its proximity to an urban area. they also looked at several important economic statistics, including median household income and the percentage of adults who were unemployed.

finally, they analyzed four variables grouped together as ""social identities"": the percentage of people who (a.) were over 65, (b.) had no college degree, (c.) identified as non-hispanic whites, and (d.) were affiliated with a religion.

""in general, the counties that swung the most [from obama to trump] were those that were almost entirely white,"" the researchers report. rural counties were more likely to have shifted republican than urban counties, as were counties in which fewer people had college educations.

in contrast, ""median county income, adults not working, and county employment [rates]"" were not predictive of a shift in political affiliation. nor, surprisingly, was religiosity: the researchers argue that their findings suggest whiteness ""plays a greater role in explaining trump's support among white evangelicals than religion.""

so the less educated you were, and the less likely you were to actually know any people of color, the more susceptible you were to trump's fear-mongering. this suggests that these rural voters were voting to uphold ""certain racialized and gendered norms,"" the researchers argue.

krier and his colleagues note that democrats did well in the 2018 mid-terms in iowa, picking up two congressional seats. but ""prominent ethno-nationalist"" representative steve king won re-election in his largely rural district, krier reminds us, suggesting that the ""social and geographic gulfs"" between rural and urban areas are continuing to widen.

all this is not to say that liberals should ignore any county that contains a barn. indeed, eric levitz recently argued in new york magazine that appeals like buttigieg's (bernie sanders has offered similar statements) make some strategic sense. they certainly represent a better strategy than dismissing a substantial proportion of the electorate as ""deplorables.""

but democrats need to be clear-eyed about what actually drove voters' decisions, and to recognize that trump—and other republican candidates willing to play to voters' prejudices—will likely hold onto those voters' allegiance. status anxiety, especially when it's tied to one's racial identity, is a highly resonant appeal, in good economic times and bad.

""at the gut level, people react to identities and protect those identities more than their livelihoods,"" co-author kusow concludes. and for many americans, as political scientist ashley jardina has eloquently argued, that means their identities as white people."
Barr says he didn't review underlying evidence of Mueller report before making obstruction call,327,bjngf5,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/441643-barr-says-he-didnt-review-underlying-evidence-of-mueller-report,92,1556778673.0,,"attorney general william barr bill barremails show park police reliance on pepper balls, outside police forces during lafayette protests nevada republican party sends criminal referral to doj alleging thousands of cases of voter fraud doj tells prosecutors armed federal agents are allowed in ballot counting centers: report more said wednesday that he did not review the underlying evidence in special counsel robert mueller's report before he concluded that mueller's findings did not reach the threshold to charge president trump donald john trump republican philadelphia official responsible for vote counting says office getting death threats biden will call governors, mayors about mask mandate trump campaign voter fraud hotline flooded with prank calls more with obstructing justice.

barr described this approach as a standard practice in which officials at the department of justice (doj) often rely on the characterization of the evidence uncovered in an investigation.

""we accepted the statements in the report as the actual record. we did not go underneath it to see whether or not they were accurate. we accepted it as accurate,"" barr said wednesday while testifying before the senate judiciary committee. advertisement

the revelation came during a line of questioning led by sen. kamala harris kamala harrishow us newspapers played biden's win saudi leaders congratulate biden, harris one day after election victory new zealand's jacinda ardern congratulates biden, harris: 'your message of unity is one we share' more (d-calif.), a 2020 presidential candidate, who pressed barr on what evidence he reviewed before determining that there was not sufficient evidence to charge the president with obstruction.

barr noted that he was not the only one to make this determination, stating that, to his knowledge, outgoing deputy attorney general rod rosenstein rod rosensteintrump turns his ire toward cabinet members ex-deputy attorney general says justice dept.

barr, however, sought to defend his handling of the report.

""prosecution memos go up to the supervisor. in this case it was the attorney general and deputy attorney general who decide on the final decision, and that is based on the memo presented to the u.s. attorney’s office,"" barr said.

""we presented the evidence presented in the report. this is not a mysterious process. and in the department of justice we have cross memos and declination memos every day coming up, and we don’t go and look at the underlying evidence. we take the characterization of the evidence as true,"" he added.



his statements come at a time when democratic scrutiny of the attorney general's handling of the mueller report is reaching a fever pitch. democrats, who have accused barr of acting as the president's defense attorney, increasingly are calling on barr to resign.

barr has faced sharp backlash from democrats for his handling of mueller's more than 400-page report on his investigation into russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice by trump. the attorney general in march delivered a four-page summary of mueller's investigation to congress — a summary that the special counsel pushed back on.

a justice department spokeswoman said tuesday that mueller expressed “frustration” to barr over the lack of context in his memo describing the special counsel's investigation’s findings.

barr’s letter was sent nearly a month before he released a redacted version of mueller’s 448-page report. trump has seized on the report's findings as exonerating him of any alleged wrongdoing."
"Health insurance deductibles soar, leaving Americans with unaffordable bills",320,bka66t,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-health-insurance-medical-bills-20190502-story.html,59,1556928346.0,,"soaring deductibles and medical bills are pushing millions of american families to the breaking point, fueling an affordability crisis that is pulling in middle-class households with health insurance as well as the poor and uninsured.

in the last 12 years, annual deductibles in job-based health plans have nearly quadrupled and now average more than $1,300.

yet americans’ savings are not keeping pace, data show. and more than four in 10 workers enrolled in a high-deductible plan report they don’t have enough savings to cover the deductible.

one in six americans who get insurance through their jobs say they’ve had to make “difficult sacrifices” to pay for healthcare in the last year, including cutting back on food, moving in with friends or family, or taking extra jobs. and one in five say healthcare costs have eaten up all or most of their savings.

advertisement

those are among the key findings of a los angeles times examination of job-based health insurance — the most common form of coverage for working-age americans — which has undergone a rapid transformation, requiring patients to pay thousands of dollars out of their own pockets.

the conclusions are based in part on a nationwide poll the times conducted in partnership with the nonprofit kaiser family foundation, or kff. two washington-based think tanks — the health care cost institute and the employee benefit research institute — provided supplemental analysis.

the times also interviewed doctors, business leaders, researchers and dozens of americans with high-deductible coverage and reviewed scores of studies and surveys of health insurance in the u.s.

at a time when healthcare is poised to be a central issue in the 2020 presidential election, these sources provide a comprehensive look at changes that have profoundly reshaped insurance.

the explosion in cost-sharing is endangering patients’ health as millions, including those with serious illnesses, skip care, independent research and the times/kff poll show.

the shift in costs has also driven growing numbers of americans with health coverage to charities and crowd-funding sites like gofundme in order to defray costs.

and it is feeding resentments and deepening inequalities, as healthier and wealthier americans are able to save for unexpected medical bills while the less fortunate struggle to balance costly care with other necessities.

“it feels like the system isn’t working,” said andrew holko, a 45-year-old father of two who is facing $5,000 in outstanding medical bills because of diabetes medications, cortisone injections his wife needs for pelvic pain, a recent trip to the emergency room for his 9-year-old daughter and other services.

holko’s information technology job puts his household income above $80,000, close to the median for a family of four. but with a mortgage, student loans and two growing children, holko says he has little extra to cover a $4,000 annual deductible.

“we shop at discount grocery stores. my wife is couponing. we are putting every single bill we can on the credit card,” holko said, noting that even a family meal at mcdonald’s seems like a luxury. “we’re drowning.”

in the poll of working-age adults with job-based insurance, a quarter said they had put off vacations or major purchases in order to pay for healthcare. a quarter have curtailed spending on clothing and other basic household goods.

half said costs had forced them or a close family member to delay a doctor’s appointment, not fill a prescription or postpone some other medical care in the previous year. that is higher than some other national surveys, but a study published thursday by american cancer society researchers found that in the last year, 56% of all u.s. adults had problems paying medical bills, delayed care or worried about affording care.

hardest hit in the cost shift are lower-income workers and those with serious medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer — who are more than twice as likely as healthier workers, according to the times/kff poll, to report problems paying medical bills and to say they’ve cut back on spending for food, clothing and other household items.

“there has been a quiet revolution in what health insurance means in this country,” said drew altman, the longtime head of the kaiser family foundation. “this happened under the radar while everyone was focused on the affordable care act.”

the 2010 healthcare law — often called obamacare — provided landmark protections to americans once shut out of health coverage. but as democrats and republicans fought over the law, altman said, neither focused on the rapid run-up in costs for people covered through work.

“we forgot that most people get their insurance through an employer, and for them, the issue is medical bills that they increasingly cannot afford,” altman said.

as recently as 2006, nearly half of workers had a health plan with no deductible at all: their insurance began immediately covering medical costs, often requiring them to pay, at most, a small percentage of their bills.

the average deductible for a single worker with a job-based insurance plan in 2006 was just $379, adjusted for inflation, according to an annual employer survey that kff has conducted for more than two decades. by 2018, that figure had more than tripled to $1,350. four in 10 u.s. workers have at least a $1,500 deductible — the threshold the poll used for high-deductible coverage for individuals.

over the same time, insurance premiums also increased, rising at more than double the rate of inflation and outpacing wage gains.

“people are trying hard to do the right thing, but care is being priced out of their reach,” said dr. barbara mcaneny, president of the american medical assn., the nation’s largest physicians’ organization.

advertisement

like many doctors, nurses and hospital leaders, mcaneny, an oncologist in new mexico, can tick off stories of patients who have health insurance yet delayed critical care, fearing the bills.

“the original idea of deductibles and co-pays theoretically might have made sense — if patients have more responsibility for how they spend medical dollars, they would be more careful,” mcaneny said. “but it is just shifting costs to the patients, and people are forgoing care they need.”

feeling the strain are people like sandy westbrook, a 55-year-old nurse’s assistant at an ohio nursing home.

westbrook, who earns less than $12 an hour, says she cut back on trips to the grocery store as she scrimped to pay off nearly $1,000 in medical bills after she broke her wrist and had to see a cardiologist for stress. “i get fed at work, thank god,” she said.

shanona nichols, a 26-year-old office assistant in michigan, moved back in with her mother to save money to pay medical bills from treatment for endometriosis.

tomas krusliak, a 27-year-old chef in western virginia, took on two extra jobs, working some days from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., to pay medical bills after his wife had a miscarriage as the couple tried to have their first baby. they had a $5,000 deductible.

“i was used to having insurance where i could go to the doctor and get the treatment i needed,” said krusliak, who is originally from slovakia. “it was definitely a shock when i got to the u.s. and learned that even when you are working and getting insurance, you have to spend even more money to get treatment.”

many other industrialized nations rely on private health insurance, but few of their citizens face the kind of medical bills americans routinely do. fewer than one in 10 patients in germany and holland, for example, reported problems getting medical care because of cost, the new york-based commonwealth fund found in a 2016 survey.

by contrast, four in 10 u.s. workers had difficulty paying a medical bill or insurance premium in the previous 12 months, according to the times-kff poll conducted last fall.

“people are trying hard to do the right thing, but care is being priced out of their reach,” said barbara mcaneny, president of the american medical assn. (steven st. john / for the times)

the challenges are most severe for people with the highest deductibles, according to the poll: nearly half of those in a plan with at least a $3,000 individual deductible or a $5,000 family deductible reported problems affording healthcare.

even americans with chronic conditions such as diabetes use less medical care if they have a high-deductible plan, according to an analysis conducted for the times by the health care cost institute, which examined three years of insurance data for 10 million workers.

advertisement

other academic studies show patients with cancer, epilepsy, arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other serious diseases also delay care or skimp on vital medications when they are required to pay more out of pocket. doctors typically recommend patients with such conditions get regular care to control the disease and prevent complications.

this wasn’t how the high-deductible revolution was supposed to play out.

twenty years ago, amid a backlash against hmo restrictions on people’s ability to choose their doctors, high-deductible plans were billed as a way to empower patients and free them from the unpopular constraints of managed care.

× healthcare costs have been an issue for decades. deductibles were meant to give patients skin in the game, but have risen steadily.

advertisement

even then there were red flags: as far back as the 1970s, a landmark study by the california-based rand corp. had found that requiring people to pay more out of pocket caused them to cut back on medical care they needed as well as on unnecessary services.

backers of the high-deductible strategy nevertheless argued that patients, given “skin in the game,” would become active consumers who would force drugmakers, hospitals and other medical providers to rein in prices.

“the thing that caught people’s imagination was this idea of unleashing american patients as consumers,” said dr. arnie milstein, medical director of the california-based pacific business group on health, an organization of large companies, including boeing, safeway, walmart and wells fargo.

employers, desperate for a way to control healthcare spending, saw an opportunity to hold down costs.

advertisement

many of the first companies to offer high-deductible plans gave employees seed money for medical savings accounts, with the idea that the cash would help workers pay their deductibles. within a few years, the george w. bush administration — backed later by congress — carved out tax benefits for the accounts.

the latest from washington »

as high-deductible plans caught fire, however, many employers saw they could save even more by not contributing to their employees’ accounts.

“the idea was hijacked,” said tony miller, a minnesota healthcare entrepreneur who developed some of the first high-deductible plans for large employers like medical device giant medtronic, but who has since grown disenchanted with how companies shifted costs onto patients.

advertisement

the change left workers responsible for saving for healthcare on their own.

yet government data show that most workers haven’t had extra money to set aside.

in 2016, the most recent year with available data, just half of single households and six in 10 multi-person households had even $2,000 in available savings — including cash, non-retirement stocks, mutual funds and other liquid assets — according to a kff analysis of government data conducted for the times.

advertisement

“in the real world, average people are living paycheck to paycheck,” said helen darling, the former head of the national business group on health, a leading employer organization focused on health benefits. “unfortunately, that never got through to the policy debate.”

moreover, the vision of legions of patients becoming engaged shoppers pushing down prices has turned out to be a mirage.

only 17% of workers say they have attempted to shop around to find the best price for a medical service in the previous year, according to the times-kaiser poll.

and doctors, hospitals and clinics continue to make costs nearly impossible for patients to determine, according to consumer advocates, independent research and the times/kff survey. two-thirds of surveyed workers said finding out the cost of a medical treatment or procedure was somewhat or very difficult.

advertisement

today, most americans with a job-based health plan still give their insurance good marks. two-thirds call their coverage excellent or good, according to the times/kff poll, which found that workers are primarily grateful to have any coverage.

but those with the highest deductibles are substantially less satisfied, with fewer than half giving their plans high marks.

americans with chronic illnesses are more likely than healthy workers to say their insurance has gotten worse in recent years and less likely to feel the system works well for people like them, the poll found.

across the board, large numbers of u.s. workers are looking for relief.

advertisement

in a major reversal from 15 years ago, six in 10 americans with job-based coverage now call affordability the most important feature of a health plan, outranking previous top concerns such as a broad choice of doctors and hospitals and a wide range of benefits.

“the whole situation drives me nuts,” said bryan shirley, a lawyer in minnesota who said in the past he would question whether he needed to take his children to the doctor because he worried about paying the deductible. “it’s the worst feeling as a parent.”

shirley, 46, said he put off medical attention for his sports injuries and at one point put thousands of dollars of medical bills on credit cards.

advertisement

“i know we are better off than most,” he said. “but i feel like there must be a better way.”

he’s not alone.

a growing number of healthcare officials, and even some corporate leaders, say it’s time to reassess the cost-sharing revolution.

“i would love to see us reevaluate the whole purpose of co-pays and deductibles,” said mcaneny, the american medical assn. president. “it makes no sense to put a barrier in front of care patients need to get.”

advertisement

even former utah gov. mike leavitt, a republican who supported the move to higher deductibles as health and human services secretary in the george w. bush administration, acknowledged that adjustments may be needed, even if returning to the days of no-deductible coverage is not the solution.

“there needs to be a way to relieve the pressure,” leavitt said. “otherwise, people will feel like they have no insurance at all.”

Durbin: McConnell ignored election security because GOP benefited from Russians,133,blxd09,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/dick-durbin-mitch-mcconnell-russian-interference-1309624,74,1557297687.0,,"""he ignores the mueller report and our intelligence agencies or in the alternative feels the russians were on the side of the republicans in 2016 and just might be again in 2020,” sen. dick durbin said. | carolyn kaster/ap photo congress durbin: mcconnell ignored election security because gop benefited from russians

sen. dick durbin suggested tuesday that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell wasn’t putting election security legislation up for a vote because republicans benefited from russian interference in the 2016 election.

the democratic whip’s remarks come after mcconnell declared in a floor speech tuesday “case closed” on special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election.

“there are two possibilities,” durbin said. “he really doesn’t believe it, he doesn’t think the russians were involved in 2016. he ignores the mueller report and our intelligence agencies or in the alternative feels the russians were on the side of the republicans in 2016 and just might be again in 2020.”

durbin added that he hopes that “that latter possibility is so remote as to being impossible.”

mcconnell fired back at democratic criticism in his floor speech tuesday morning, blasting democrats for mocking sen. john mccain (r-ariz.) and then-former governor mitt romney for warning about the danger of russian president vladimir putin.

“maybe stronger leadership would have left the kremlin less emboldened. maybe tampering with our democracy wouldn’t have seemed so very tempting,” he said.

mcconnell also added that congress has taken action on election security by appropriating millions of dollars to states to improve their election systems.

Fox News legal analyst says Trump violated Constitution's “separation of powers” three times in past week,401,bpi7u6,https://www.newsweek.com/trump-violated-constitution-separation-powers-three-times-1427253,78,1558069882.0,,"fox news' senior judicial analyst andrew napolitano warned that president donald trump had continued a ""very dangerous trend"" by violating the constitution's ""separation of powers"" three times in the past week alone.

napolitano, who formerly served as a new jersey superior court judge, used his weekly fox news digital episode of judge napolitano's chambers on wednesday to explain that the constitution's framers had intended for power to be separated into three branches of government: the executive, the legislative and the judicial. he said that trump had made three decisions in the past week that violated that framework.

""we call it the separation of powers,"" napolitano said. ""the president can't write the laws, the congress can't put somebody on trial and the courts can't determine tax rates,"" he said. ""that is at least the theory of the constitution.""

the former judge said that for more than a century now, ""more and more power"" had accumulated in the executive branch, or the presidency, because of a disregard for the separation of powers, which napolitano called a ""very disturbing"" and a ""very dangerous trend.""

napolitano outlined three recent directives from trump and explained how they violated the constitution. the first was the president's order to acting secretary of defense patrick shanahan to not purchase a missile defense system approved by congress and instead use the funds to construct a wall on the u.s.-mexico border. second, the former judge cited trump's order to send troops to secure the border, pointing out how it violated the separation of powers, because the president's oath does not allow military forces to be deployed to deal with domestic issues. napolitano also argued that trump's decision to impose 25 percent tariffs on chinese goods was akin to levying a ""national federal sales tax"" on american consumers, which the president did not have power to do under the constitution.

""it is dangerous when presidents write their own laws, impose their own taxes, spend money how they want and congress looks the other way,"" napolitano asserted. ""it's dangerous because its too much of an accumulation of power in the presidency, and it imbalances that delicate balance that the separation of powers created.""

democratic lawmakers have tried to challenge many of trump's controversial decisions, using arguments similar to those made by napolitano. the president's efforts to reappropriate money approved by congress for other uses to his border wall faces court challenges and bipartisan criticism.

trump's escalating trade war with china has also drawn controversy. although the president has repeatedly insisted that the chinese will pay the tariffs, economists and industry experts said that was inaccurate. as napolitano explained, the tariffs are essentially additional taxes on american consumers. china will likely experience significant economic fallout as its products become significantly more expensive in the u.s. market, potentially leading consumers to seek out cheaper alternatives, but the chinese will not be paying the tariffs.

larry kudlow, the president's director of the national economic council, conceded that ""both sides will suffer"" as a result of the tariffs during an interview on fox news sunday."
Trump Admits to Russia ‘Helping Me to Get Elected’,326,busrz0,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/trump-russia-help-elected.html,88,1559249483.0,,"“frankly, this isn’t what the american people elected them to do,” representative steve scalise of louisiana, the second-ranking republican in the house, said on wednesday night on fox news. “i think there is going to be a heavy price for democrats who go down this path.”

mr. mueller’s statement on wednesday, while carefully tracking his written report, shook up the debate in washington and clearly got under the president’s skin. mr. mueller reported that he could not establish any illegal conspiracy between mr. trump’s campaign and russia, but he said he could not clear the president of obstruction of justice and essentially suggested that congress take up that question.

mr. trump fumed with friends that mr. mueller was out to get him. bill o’reilly, the former fox news host, told wabc-am radio that mr. trump called him at 11 that night and complained about mr. mueller’s supposed conflicts.

the president’s case for his own defense, however, was marred by his own contradictory statements on thursday as he swung back and forth in his characterizations of russia’s actions during the 2016 presidential election.

“i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected,” mr. trump wrote on twitter before leaving the white house in the morning. while denying any involvement, the president’s comment was an acknowledgment that moscow not only intervened in the campaign but also did so for the express purpose of helping elect him — the consensus conclusion of the nation’s intelligence agencies.

but barely a half-hour later, mr. trump emerged on the south lawn and took it back. “no, russia did not help me get elected,” he told reporters as he prepared to depart for colorado springs. “you know who got me elected? i got me elected. russia didn’t help me at all. russia, if anything, i think, helped the other side.”

in fact, even president vladimir v. putin of russia has said publicly that he favored mr. trump over hillary clinton in 2016, although he has denied orchestrating an influence campaign on behalf of the republican candidate."

reacting to reports that house speaker nancy pelosi said she doesn’t want to see president trump impeached because she would rather “see him in prison,” fox news host sean hannity lashed out at the democratic leader thursday night.

during his show-opening monologue, the pro-trump cable news star took aim at congressional democrats over their desire to impeach the president, claiming they are getting assistance from “the psychotic media mob conspiracy theorist liars.”

adding that the democratic party is the “party of anti-trump rage and psychosis,” he moved on to pelosi’s recent comments that impeachment “is not enough.”

“speaker nancy pelosi telling senior democrats she would like to see trump behind bars,” hannity exclaimed. “based on no actual crimes, she wants a political opponent locked up in prison. umm, that happens in banana republics. beyond despicable behavior.”

pelosi's statement, he said, was proof democrats want to turn the united states into a country that we “no longer recognize.”

calls for the jailing of political opponents is something hannity should recognize very well, however. trump’s campaign rallies have long been marked by chants of “lock her up” directed at former democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton.

besides encouraging calls for clinton to be jailed, trump has also accused democratic lawmakers of “treason” over their border security policies and repeatedly leveled that charge against fbi officials over the russia investigation.

hannity, meanwhile, has largely led the charge in calling for clinton to be investigated and face potential prison time. two-and-a-half years after the 2016 election, the fox host was still claiming the former secretary of state’s “email server is a real threat to our safety and security.”"

New York City set to become 1st city to fund abortion services.,253,c109ai,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-city-set-1st-city-fund-abortion-services/story?id=63730538,27,1560651034.0,,"new york city set to become 1st city to fund abortion services the funding is part of the city's 2020 budget.

tucked away in a $92.5 billion budget, agreed to with a handshake deal between mayor bill de blasio and city council speaker corey johnson on friday, was an agreement to make new york city the first city in the country to fund abortion services.

the new york abortion access fund will provide $250,000 from the budget to help low-income citizens access abortion services.

the funding was championed by the council's women's caucus, led by co-chairs margaret chin and carlina rivera.

""before roe v wade, nyc was a haven for women who wanted the freedom to choose,"" rivera wrote on twitter. ""it's time for our city to be that beacon for the country once again.""

the council is required to vote on the budget before july 1, but passage is expected as a formality.

roe v. wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court ruling that protects a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, has come under assault more than ever in recent months. multiple states have instituted severely restrictive bans on abortion, often only allowing them when the mother's life is at risk.

georgia, missouri, ohio, alabama, kentucky and mississippi are among the states to pass some of the most restrictive bans, often labeled ""heartbeat"" bans, for not allowing the procedure after a fetal heartbeat is detected.

in all, 17 bans have been signed in 10 states in 2019 -- but every type of ban is facing a legal challenge, and none of the laws have been enacted.

many conservative politicians and activists hope those legal challenges will be appealed up to the supreme court, where recent donald trump appointees brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch have tipped the power, 5-4, in favor of conservative judges.

other states, including new york, have gone in the opposite direction -- passing protections for a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion.

new york city is the first municipality to actually provide funding for those in need, though.

""this was an initiative coming out of the council, but i certainly support it,"" de blasio said at a press conference friday. ""we understand that there are women who need help and are having trouble getting the help they need. and the city had an opportunity here to step up.""

de blasio is currently running for the democratic nomination for president in 2020. he has been an outspoken advocate for abortion access and supports the repeal of the hyde amendment, which doesn't allow federal funding for abortion services.

""i am proud that we are doing this,"" johnson said friday. ""this is to help low-income women in new york city who have faced barriers to access to health care, get the care that they need and that they deserve.

""and what typically happens when abortion care is restricted across the country, wealthier women still can get abortions because they can fly to places and drive across state lines to get abortions. but what happens is low-income women, predominately women of color, are the ones that are locked out of the health care system and aren’t able to have abortion access."""
"Immigrant children forcibly injected with drugs at Texas shelter, lawsuit claims",2,c3swuk,https://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/20/immigrant-children-forcibly-injected-drugs-lawsuit-claims/,2,1561255891.0,,"families divided more in this series

president donald trump’s ""zero tolerance"" policy is creating a zombie army of children forcibly injected with medications that make them dizzy, listless, obese and even incapacitated, according to legal filings that show immigrant children in u.s. custody subdued with powerful psychiatric drugs.

children held at the shiloh treatment center, a government contractor south of houston that houses immigrant minors, described being held down and injected, according to the federal court filings. the lawsuit alleges that children were told they would not be released or see their parents unless they took medication and that they only were receiving vitamins.

parents and the children themselves told attorneys the drugs rendered them unable to walk, afraid of people and wanting to sleep constantly, according to affidavits filed april 23 in u.s. district court in california.

one mother said her child fell repeatedly, hitting her head, and ended up in a wheelchair. a child described trying to open a window and being hurled against a door by a shiloh supervisor, who then choked her until she fainted.

“the supervisor told me i was going to get a medication injection to calm me down,” the girl said. “two staff grabbed me, and the doctor gave me the injection despite my objection and left me there on the bed.”

another child recounted being made to take pills in the morning, at noon and night. the child said “the staff told me that some of the pills are vitamins because they think i need to gain weight. the vitamins changed about two times, and each time i feel different.”

shiloh is among 71 companies that receive funds from the federal government to house and supervise immigrant children deemed unaccompanied minors.

an investigation by reveal from the center for investigative reporting and the texas tribune found that nearly half of the $3.4 billion paid to those companies in the last four years went to homes with serious allegations of mistreating children. in nearly all cases reviewed by reveal, the federal government continued contracts with the companies after serious allegations were raised.

at reveal’s request, forensic psychiatrist mark. j. mills assessed materials from 420 pages of children’s medical records and statements filed in california federal court this april.

“you don’t have to be a rocket scientist here; it looks like they’re trying to control agitation and aggressive behavior with antipsychotic drugs,” said mills, who practices in the washington, d.c., area and was an expert witness for a lawsuit that in 2008 stopped the federal government from forcibly administering antipsychotic drugs to deportees.

“you don’t need to administer these kinds of drugs unless someone is plucking out their eyeball or some such. the facility should not use these drugs to control behavior. that’s not what antipsychotics should be used for. that’s like the old soviet union used to do.”

the records were filed in connection with an ongoing class action status lawsuit alleging poor treatment of immigrant children in u.s. custody. an attorney representing the children said youth separated from their parents often become depressed, angry, anxious and, sometimes, unruly, and that in turn encourages prescription of inappropriate medication.

one child was prescribed 10 different shots and pills, including the antipsychotic drugs latuda, geodon and olanzapine, the parkinson’s medication benztropine, the seizure medications clonazepam and divalproex, the nerve pain medication and antidepressant duloxetine, and the cognition enhancer guanfacine.

dosage recommendations at shiloh gave orderlies what mills called an unusually wide berth to determine how much medicine to give the children.

maribel bernardez first suspected her son was being drugged at the shiloh facility when she saw a video sent by his caseworker via whatsapp.

“he was completely hypnotized and lethargic,” bernardez told reveal.

bernardez, now reunited with her son in new orleans and seeking asylum from honduras, provided reveal with records showing her son was held at the shiloh facility for six months. he was 9 when he landed at shiloh last november after being referred for what staff considered psychological issues. reveal is not publishing his name at his mother’s request.

medical records show that bernardez’s son was administered psychotropic drugs at shiloh. she told reveal that she repeatedly objected and did not sign any consent form.

the shiloh treatment center has not responded to a request from reveal for comment about the case. the government office of refugee resettlement has not responded either.

side effects of the medications make some children feel even more desperate, leading to the prescription of increasingly powerful medications, said carlos holguin, an attorney for the los angeles-based center for human rights & constitutional law. holguin is asking a judge to require parents’ permission or a court order before children in the country illegally can be medicated.

shiloh already had a reputation for mistreating children. in december 2014, u.s. rep. sheila jackson lee, d-houston, called for shiloh to be shut down, citing reports from the houston chronicle of “physical violence, unreasonable and excessive use of physical restraints, administering emergency medications without notice to governmental authorities, and several deaths of minor children while in custody,” she said in a statement.

but the u.s. department of health and human services continued sending children and funds to shiloh – a total of more than $19 million after the congresswoman called for its closure, according to federal payment records.

shiloh has contracted to house immigrant children since 2013. last year, the most lucrative yet under its agreement, shiloh collected $5.6 million.

children and parents interviewed by the attorneys described being forcibly injected or made to take as many as 18 pills a day. one record reviewed by mills showed a child taking a battery of shots and pills that included three different types of antipsychotic drugs, which mills said were improperly prescribed for “agitation” and “aggressive behavior.”

of the 20 or so children holguin and his colleagues interviewed, all had been medicated. parents he interviewed described the results.

“i understand they are requiring (my daughter) to take very powerful medications for anxiety. i have noted that (my daughter) is becoming more nervous, fearful, and she trembles,” one said. “(my daughter) tells me that she has fallen several times and has injured her head and arms, to the point that she ended up in a wheelchair, because the medications were too powerful and she couldn’t walk. she has complained about the medications to the staff, that they make her afraid of people.”

medical records included in the court exhibits suggest improper use of medications, according to mills.

asked how such drugs and dosages would make children feel, mills said: “they feel like shit. they feel like they have given up their own control. the long-term complications are weight gain and developing adult onset diabetes. these drugs are not benign.”"

donald trump jr., the president's eldest son and outspoken defender, fanned the flames of a racist conspiracy by sharing a tweet falsely claiming that sen. kamala harris isn't a black american.

the tweet that trump jr. promoted suggested that harris, who was born in oakland, california to an indian immigrant mother and a black jamaican immigrant father, isn't black enough to be an authority on issues of race.

""kamala harris is implying she is descended from american black slaves,"" ali alexander, a fringe alt-right activist, tweeted. ""she's not. she comes from jamaican slave owners. that's fine. she's not an american black. period.""

trump jr. shared alexander's tweet with his 3.6 million followers during thursday's democratic 2020 primary debate, writing, ""is this true? wow.""

during thursday's debate, harris took a few minutes to discuss issues of race, challenging former vice president joe biden on his record of opposing school desegregation through busing, and his recent controversial remarks about his work with notorious segregationist senators.

""growing up, my sister and i had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she — because we were black,"" harris added, at one point noting that she was the ""only black person on this stage.""

alexander told the daily beast that he attacked harris because she ""stole debate time under the premise that she is an african-american when she is in fact a biracial indian-jamaican who is a first generation american.""

trump jr. later deleted his tweet. harris' campaign compared the attack to the president's years-long attempts to discredit president barack obama with his ""birther"" conspiracy.

""this is the same type of racist attacks his father used to attack barack obama. it didn't work then and it won't work now,"" campaign spokeswoman lily adams told news outlets.

a spokesman for trump jr. said he erased the message after his followers ""misconstrued"" its intent.

""don's tweet was simply him asking if it was true that kamala harris was half-indian because it's not something he had ever heard before,"" andy surabian, trump jr.'s spokesperson told the new york times, ""and once he saw that folks were misconstruing the intent of his tweet, he quickly deleted it.""

but, with trump jr.'s help, the message went viral in conservative circles online, fueling existing conspiracies about harris' race as part of broader right-wing attempts to discredit the candidate.

""my tweet is ridiculously viral. you're welcome, america!"" alexander tweeted on friday night. ""indian-jamaican kamala harris is bad for black americans. #blackhillary."""
Smartphones aren’t making millennials grow horns. Here’s how to spot a bad study.,319,c7nqp7,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/smartphones-arent-making-millennials-grow-horns-heres-how-to-spot-a-bad-study,5,1561981834.0,,"it’s the kind of story that could sound true, but seems off.

that was the feeling i got last week, when a washington post article — “horns are growing on young people’s skulls. phone use is to blame, research suggests” — appeared in my email inbox.

the report covers a 2018 study published in scientific reports, which used head x-rays of 1,200 chiropractic patients to claim that young adults aged 18 to 30 are growing bone masses on the backs of their skulls, a supposed phenomenon that the washington post described as “horns” (which are technically bone spurs called enlarged external occipital protuberances — eeops or eops).

a week before the washington post article, bbc future published a feature story on “how modern life is transforming the human skeleton,” which featured the same study from scientific reports.

the original study and both news stories — which have gone viral, picked up by dozens more outlets in recent days — link these alleged bone deformities to the use of mobile technology, specifically because users are bending “their heads forward to make sense of what’s happening on the miniature screens,” as the post wrote.

“we are looking into issues regarding this paper and we will take action where appropriate.” – scientific reports spokesperson

there’s one problem.

the researchers “haven’t provided the data to back up their claim,” said john hawks, a paleoanthropologist at the university of wisconsin, who studies human evolution and was not involved in the study.

on a basic level, the study has flaws, namely that it makes written claims that are not supported by the numbers, images and other data reported in the study itself. this isn’t a situation where a research group made a controversial discovery, and other scientists simply disagree.

scientific reports is published by nature research, one of the most well-regarded science publishers in the world. typically, all scientific reports papers are peer reviewed by two reviewers on average, according to a statement from the publisher. that can help safeguard against the publication of unsound research but it isn’t a guarantee. those reviewers are typically experts in their fields of study, but it is against nature research’s editorial policy to reveal their names.

“we are looking into issues regarding this paper and we will take action where appropriate,” a spokesperson for scientific reports told the pbs newshour on friday.

“when any concerns are raised with scientific reports about papers we have published, we investigate them carefully following established procedures, but we cannot comment on the specific editorial history of a particular paper published in the journal,” the scientific reports spokesperson stated.

i asked people on twitter if they could spot the issues with the study. (some were more apparent than others). you can read the paper yourself, given it is open-access. i even offered clues.

this isn’t the first time thin research has gone viral, but this episode involves more than just a study with a few flaws.

this story became popular in part due to the nature of the modern media landscape, specifically how news organizations re-report stories, and how quickly stories steeped in moral panic are shared on social media. and recent research tells us that it is difficult, if not impossible, to correct a viral story once it has invaded the zeitgeist.

so what can you do?

here’s a list of the reasons you should be skeptical of this study, ranked from obvious to expert, and some questions to ask before you share a story that seems suspicious.

1. the study doesn’t actually measure cellphone usage

this is the most basic flaw. the study does not measure the cellphone usage of its 1,200 patients.

there are now smartphone apps that can record a person’s screen time, but the researchers did not employ them. i asked one of the co-authors — david shahar, a chiropractor who specializes in biomechanics at the university of the sunshine coast in australia — about why the team didn’t directly measure smartphone usage.

the overall tone of the paper is at odds with the data that they actually have to make any of these particular claims.

“other studies have reported on that issue,” shahar, who co-authored the paper with sports biomechanicist mark sayers, told the pbs newshour via email. “this study was not about the use of mobile devices, but it is about the prevalence of eeop across the age groups.”

still, the study starts by hypothesizing a possible link between how bad postures “associated with the emergence and extensive use of hand-held contemporary technologies, such as smartphones and tablets.”

“they’re arguing that young people are spending a lot of time hunched over their laptops and their phones,” said jeff goldsmith, a biostatistician at columbia university. “but they don’t actually have any data about screen time, their [subjects’] typical posture or about any of the things that might give you a way to evaluate that hypothesis.”

the study assumes that the people age 18 to 30 in this study used their phones more than older subjects, based purely on the general habits of society. but shahar and sayers did not provide data on their subjects to support that assumption.

“the overall tone of the paper is at odds with the data that they actually have to make any of these particular claims,” goldsmith added.

2. the findings mean nothing for the general population

shahar and sayers write that the study “demonstrated the prevalence of [eop] to be 33% of the total population” and that “our findings raise a concern about the future musculoskeletal health of the young adult population.”

they worked from a database that was based on people who went to the chiropractor for help, so first of all, the study is not a random, representative sample.

but a study must have a random, demographically representative sample in order to be applicable to the public at-large. and these subjects did not represent a general population, or close to it.

“if you notice, they worked from a database that was based on people who went to the chiropractor for help, so first of all, the study is not a random, representative sample,” said regina nuzzo, senior advisor for statistics communication and media innovation at the american statistical association.

furthermore, the team may have also skewed their pool of patients by only including people from that database who reported mild symptoms. anyone who went to a chiropractor with severe symptoms was automatically excluded from the analysis.

those excluded might have primarily been older people, given the elderly suffer from more bone issues, including these bone spurs. indeed, figure 3 from the paper shows their subjects older than 60 were more likely to have a posture condition — called forward head protraction — which seems to parallel an increase in eops, shown in figure 4.

“the generalizations you can make from this study are very, very limited,” nuzzo said.

despite those limitations, shahar and sayers argue that their “findings raise a concern about the future musculoskeletal health of the young adult population and reinforce the need for prevention intervention through posture improvement education.”

on saturday, quartz reported that shahar runs an online store that sells posture pillows.

3. the study isn’t studying horns

let’s settle this horn business. the study did not look at horns. a bone spur is not a horn, as hawks detailed in a medium post on thursday.

a horn is made of keratin, the same material you find in animal hooves, claws and hair. shahar told the newshour that he used “horn” in his interview with the washington post and that “it is not unusual to use descriptive terms in anatomy.”

using “horn” to describe a bone spur is like saying your elbow is a fingernail.

but using “horn” to describe a bone spur is like saying your elbow is a fingernail. eops and horns are just not created in the same way.

“even if you did have a large bone outgrowth in that area, it would not look or feel like a horn,” said sara becker, a bioarchaeologist at the university of california riverside. that’s because “in living people, that area would be wrapped in muscle. even bone spurs in other regions are hard to feel or see in most people and they may not be permanent.”

becker’s point appears to contradict what the washington post story said: “those who have the hornlike feature can probably feel it.”

4. if these bone spurs are happening, where are the x-rays?

hawks, a paleoanthropologist who specializes in bone evolution, said the study did not provide the x-rays needed to confirm that the researchers were even measuring bone spurs.

providing x-rays is important because an eop is a trait that can develop in normal people with normal posture, hawks said.

these bones masses, which can form in various spots on a person’s skeleton, tend to appear later in life and be associated with bone diseases. one study of 3,670 rheumatology patients found 16 percent had spurs somewhere in the body. however, young, healthy people can grow these spurs too. one study of 234 healthy schoolchildren revealed these spurs 29 percent of the time.

“a good example are the bones of elite tennis players, where you can see not just [these] changes but thickening to the cortical bone in the playing arm,” said nivien speith, a biological anthropologist and bioarchaeologist at the university of derby. speith also said these bone spur can disappear over the course of a person’s life.

the back of the skull doesn’t only feature bone. it’s a mishmash of ligaments, connective tissues and your neck muscles, which rank among the strongest in your body. the x-rays included in the study look to be taken with different exposure conditions, hawks said. you can see a lot of soft tissue in some, for instance, but not in others, he said. “when radiographs are being taken under different conditions like that, it is really difficult to score them consistently and to know what you’re looking at.”

when asked about these additional radiographs, shahar said he “can look into making these data available.”

a bone spur, like those the study suggests, occurs due to the “nuchal ligament,” which originates at the neck’s base and runs up the middle until it connects to the head.

“the nuchal ligament helps to stabilize your head when you run,” hawks said. many primates have a nuchal ligament, but only humans experience bone spurs on their necks because of the way we run: upright. the strain created by upright physical activity can cause muscles and the nuchal ligament to pull on connective tissue, which in turn can stress the bone into forming a spur.

hawks said when comparing ancient skeletons to those of people today, you can see humans have been gradually losing their eops. this is largely because as nations become more westernized, people are less physically active.

“if you really wanted to understand the back of the neck and if it’s changing,” hawks said, “you’re going to put devices that measure muscle activity on the back of the neck to see what’s going on with their heads.” in other words, if the research team didn’t have access to a smartphone tracking app, hawks said they could have simply examined the subjects’ neck muscles to look for signs of this strain.

5. the study claims males have more of these bone spurs, but doesn’t back it up

the study claims these bone spurs on the back of the skull predominately occurred in males. it even goes as far as to quantify the difference, stating that “sex was the primary predictor with males being 5.48 times more likely to have [eop] than females.”

this finding would actually agree with what’s known in the anthropological record. “a bigger eop is more common in human male skeletons than female skeletons,” becker said

but the study, once again, does not show evidence for its assertion if you look at figure 4:

notice that in the youngest group — 18-29 year olds — there are more females with eops than males. the pattern switches for those in their 40s, but otherwise there are no sex differences.

when i asked shahar about this discrepancy between his study states and what his study shows, he replied, “while i have no doubt that the 5.48 figure is correct, i must admit that i see your point about the graph.”

shahar said he would check into the data behind these figures and respond at a later time.

6. the study also fails to make a clear connection to millennials

both goldsmith and nuzzo said the study did not include data behind its statistical models, which are necessary to confirm the connection between millennials and the eops.

in figure 4, the authors group the subjects by age and compare those groups with a statistical test called a chi-squared. that’s problematic in this case because the way the team used the test — to arbitrarily group and contrast subjects by age — made it lose the ability to make comparisons.

“that’s like a broad brush stroke. you lose all kinds of information,” nuzzo said. you lose the ability to tell how people are changing as they age, she added. without a more robust test, the study cannot allege a correlation between young age and eops.

“statistical analysis questions should be referred to a different person who is unavailable at this late hour.”

nuzzo said instead the study should have used other statistical tests that can pull out trends in multiple variables as they change over time (like linear regressions, anova or ancova). “then you’d be able to say, ‘yes, for every year or every decade, we’re able to see a 0.1 millimeter increase in bone growth,’” she said.

shahar and sayers have used these statistical alternatives, both in this study and others on the same subject. one in 2016 concluded young adults have an abundance of eops, but it didn’t look at older adults. the other in 2018 tried to make the same conclusions in healthy teenagers but only involved 4 male patients.

in the latest study published in scientific reports, shahar and sayers’ linear regression test seems to stop short. rather than use it to individually measure the influence of age, sex and forward head protraction, all of those factors are lumped together to make a connection to eop. if the factors are grouped, you can’t point to a single one — like age — and say it is the reason for the bone spurs.

they needed to do the opposite analysis — make a linear regression model that could peel apart those factors and look at how each one influences those bone spurs. nuzzo said such an analysis is nowhere to be found in the study.

“they didn’t present their results very well,” nuzzo said.

when i pointed out these statistical blips to shahar, he responded: “statistical analysis questions should be referred to a different person who is unavailable at this late hour.”

how did this happen and why does it matter?

the second part of this equation is how studies like these are covered by the media.

an outsider perspective — from a source not involved with the research — can be invaluable when trying to put a piece of science into its appropriate context or even when deciding to pass on a story.

such misinformation erodes the public’s ability to comprehend what is empirically right and backed by facts versus what is fiction.

when the washington post published its story early in the morning on june 20, the original version did not include an interview from a researcher who was not involved in the study. the bbc story also lacks outside commentary on shahar and sayers’ study.

the washington post updated its story with additional context, more than eight hours after publication, according to the wayback machine. by then the story had received massive news coverage, many of which cited the washington post and bbc as sources.

molly gannon, a communications manager for the washington post, shared this statement in response to our questions:

our story reports on the findings of studies that ran in multiple peer-reviewed journals and includes interviews with the scientists who conducted the research. it also includes an interview with an outside expert, which reflects our standard practice, and which was moved higher in the story to make it more prominent. the word ‘horns’ was used by one of the scientists.

on tuesday, the washington post also updated its story to include shahar’s possible conflict of interest regarding his posture pillows company.

a bbc spokesperson said “this is an article about osteobiography, of which dr sahar’s study was one example of many.”

the weaknesses in the “horns” study are opaque to most readers. but things you can look for when you’re trying to suss out whether a science story holds up:

outside commentary on the study at-hand

clues about whether the research was peer-reviewed and by whom,

what data the study uses as a source

and finally: does the study claim more than it proves?

this last point and this episode offer a reminder about the modern news cycle.

history shows us — such as with andrew wakefield’s retracted study on measles and autism — that the stakes are high when reporting on science and health. such misinformation erodes the public’s ability to comprehend what is empirically right and backed by facts versus what is fiction.

even if this eop study is retracted and every news story is corrected with additional context, people who saw the first story may not notice or see the update. research conducted over the last decade or so shows that once an idea gains traction in people’s minds, it can repel fact-checking. indeed, a correction can at times reinforce the misinformation.

editor’s note: this story has been updated with additional comment from the researchers on the availability of radiographs."
White Collar Prosecutions Hit All-Time Low in January 2019,217,cess35,https://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/crim/550/,27,1563486829.0,,"white collar prosecutions hit all-time low in january 2019 table 1. criminal white collar crime prosecutions number latest month 337 percent change from previous month -20.3 percent change from 1 year ago -5.3 percent change from 5 years ago

(including magistrate court) -35.7 the latest available data from the justice department show that during january 2019 the government reported 337 new white collar crime prosecutions. this is an historic low since monthly tracking began in october 1998. according to the case-by-case information analyzed by the transactional records access clearinghouse (trac) at syracuse university, this number is down 20.3 percent over the previous month, and continues a five-month downward slide. compared to five years ago, january filings were down 35.7 percent. white-collar prosecutions since president trump assumed office generally have been lower than in previous administrations. the comparisons of the number of defendants charged with white collar crime-related offenses are based on case-by-case information obtained by trac under the freedom of information act from the executive office for united states attorneys (see table 1). the decrease from the levels five years ago in white collar crime prosecutions for these matters is shown more clearly in figure 1. the vertical bars in figure 1 represent the number of white collar crime prosecutions recorded by federal prosecutors on a month-to-month basis. where a prosecution was initially filed in u.s. magistrate court and then transferred to the u.s. district court, the magistrate filing date was used since this provides an earlier indicator of actual trends. the superimposed line on the bars plots the six-month moving average so that natural fluctuations are smoothed out. the one and five-year rates of change in table 1 and in the sections that follow are all based upon this six-month moving average.



(click for larger image) figure 1. monthly trends in white collar crime prosecutions within the broad category of white collar crime, cases were classified by prosecutors into more specific types. case types within white collar crime are  federal procurement fraud  federal program fraud  tax fraud  arson for profit  other insurance fraud  financial institution fraud  bankruptcy fraud  advance fee schemes  other fraud against businesses  consumer fraud  securities fraud  commodities fraud  other investment fraud  antitrust violations - other  computer fraud  health care fraud  fraud against insurance providers  intellectual property violations  insider fraud against insurance providers  mewa (multiple employer welfare arrangements) fraud/met  antitrust violations - airlines  antitrust violations - banking  antitrust violations - defense procurement  antitrust violations - extraterritorial application of  antitrust violations - finance markets, other than banking  telemarketing fraud  corporate fraud  identity theft  aggravated identity theft  other white collar crime/fraud the largest number of prosecutions of these matters in january 2019 was for ""fraud-other"", accounting for 16.6 percent of prosecutions. prosecutions were also filed for ""fraud-financial institution"" (13.1%), ""fraud-identity theft-aggravated"" (12.2%), ""fraud-tax"" (11.9%), ""fraud-identity theft-other"" (10.1%), ""fraud-federal program"" (9.5%), ""fraud-health care"" (6.2%), ""fraud-computer"" (5.3%), ""fraud-other business"" (4.7%), ""fraud-consumer"" (2.1%), ""fraud-corporate"" (2.1%). see figure 2. the lead investigative agency for white collar crime prosecutions in january 2019 was fbi accounting for 28 percent of prosecutions referred. other agencies with substantial numbers of white collar crime referrals were: irs (14% ), dhs (13%), postal (11%), secserv (8%). see figure 3.

the late republican sen. john mccain's defense of then-sen. barack obama from a racist voter at a 2008 town hall is going viral after president donald trump did not stop racism at his wednesday evening rally in north carolina.

at the rally, trump did nothing to stop his supporters from chanting ""send her back"" for 13 seconds, referring to rep. ilhan omar, one of four progressive lawmakers of color that trump told to ""go back"" to their ""broken and crime infested"" countries in a series of racist tweets on sunday. omar was born in somalia, while the three other lawmakers were born in the us.

""john mccain"" was a trending topic on twitter throughout thursday, with many users sharing a clip of an exchange between mccain and an older voter at a minnesota town hall during his 2008 presidential run. the video highlights the stark difference between how trump and mccain dealt with racism at their political rallies.

the 2008 mccain campaign event was particularly charged as voters expressed their raw anger and fear at the idea of an obama presidency. handed the microphone by mccain, the voter said she couldn't ""trust"" obama and called him ""an arab.""

mccain cut her off, taking the microphone back from her, and he stoutly defended his democratic opponent.

""no, ma'am. he's a decent family man, citizen that i just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign's all about,"" mccain said.

many social-media users said they missed mccain for how he handled the racism before him — and lamented the uncivil state of american politics.

senate minority leader chuck schumer called on republicans to condemn trump's nativist rhetoric, invoking mccain's name in his senate floor speech.

""there's no john mccain anymore. when this kind of bitter racism emerged at his town hall meeting, he rejected it, publicly ... it went down in history as one of his finest moments,"" schumer said. ""where are the fine moments of my colleagues?""

trump tried to defuse the situation and distance himself from the chants on thursday, saying he ""disagreed"" with them and was very ""unhappy"" with them.

mr. trump, however, continued to focus on the issue, and the language. one day after disavowing the “send her back” chant that broke out at his rally on wednesday in north carolina, the president was back on twitter friday to suggest that the widespread outrage over the phrase — which caused alarm among congressional republicans and members of his inner circle who prodded him to reject it — had been misplaced.

he groused about the coverage of ms. omar’s warm reception upon her return from washington. “they even covered a tiny staged crowd as they greeted foul mouthed omar in minnesota,” mr. trump wrote, adding that people in the state “can’t stand her and her hatred of our country.”"

“this is part of a move to create an environment of fear and hatred of people who aren’t white,” nelson said. “everybody knows this question has been in dispute for several months, and it’s concerning because the census bureau is supposed to be an independent agency, with the information you provide kept confidential.”

households in idaho also have received the same census test, the idaho statesman reported. residents in california’s bay area also received surveys with the citizenship question, the mercury news reported.

nelson said the survey in conjunction with the current political climate, as families are being separated at the u.s.-mexico border, children are caged, and president donald trump directs harsh rhetoric toward minorities, refugees and people who are not u.s. citizens, creates a heightened sense of fear among minority communities.

“the repercussions of this question affect all of us in texas and any other state with a great number of documented and undocumented immigrants,” nelson said. “it creates a fear in which they won’t answer the census, and that affects future planning. that affects all of us.”"
Trump has not built single mile of new border wall since taking office,398,cgd7ut,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-border-wall-not-built-2020-campaign-a9015181.html,98,1563830974.0,[deleted],"it was the controversial campaign promise that donald trump built his 2016 electoral success on: to build what he called a “big beautiful wall” on the us border with mexico.

but, two and half years after he took office, supporters – who were so enamoured by the idea, they regularly chanted in favour of the structure – may be forgiven for wondering where exactly it is.

now, it has emerged that not a single new stretch of border wall has been built since mr trump took office in january 2017.

a statement released by the us customs and border protection (cbp) agency confirmed the 51 miles of fencing completed since mr trump took power has simply replaced barriers that already existed.

no original wall or fencing has been created in areas that previously did not have any, it said.

that is despite the fact that a total of 205 miles of both new and replacement wall and fencing has already been budgeted for since mr trump took office – including via the treasury forfeiture fund which the president redirected through controversial executive action in february.

speaking anonymously to the washington examiner, a senior official in the trump administration said engineers could move faster on so-called replacement projects than entirely new stretches of fence because the approval process for environmental and zoning permits was less extensive.

another official blamed democrats for obstructing progress. he told the newspaper: “the wall projects are moving along as quickly as practicably possible given the unprecedented obstruction from democrat lawmakers to protect and prolong open borders.”

yet it seems the lack of progress will not deter mr trump from making the wall a central part of his 2020 election campaign.

when crowds took up their now familiar refrain of “build that wall"" at a recent rally in el paso, texas, mr trump responded by telling them: “now, you really mean 'finish that wall,' because we've built a lot of it.”

Trump Administration Plans to Expand Use of Expedited Deportations,17,cgks97,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-administration-plans-to-expand-use-of-expedited-deportations/,3,1563866961.0,,"migrants, en route to the united states, make their way to san pedro tapanatepec from mexico, october 27, 2018. (ueslei marcelino/reuters)

the trump administration on monday announced a plan to expand rapid deportations for undocumented immigrants in an attempt to alleviate the heavy backlog of immigration-court cases.

currently, deportation without a hearing before an immigration judge, or “expedited removal,” is used only for undocumented immigrants within 100 miles of the border who have been in the u.s. two weeks or less. effective tuesday, the department of homeland security will expand the expedited-removal policy to all illegal immigrants who came across the southern border and cannot prove they have lived in the u.s. for at least two years, according to the notice dhs will publish in the federal register.

“in recent years, increasing numbers of aliens have been detained after being apprehended within the interior of the united states, necessitating a change in the focus of limited government resources to include the use of expedited removal proceedings for aliens apprehended within the u.s. interior, as well as near the border,” the notice reads.

the rule will almost certainly face immediate legal challenges from immigrant-advocacy groups.

u.s. immigration courts currently have a backlog of 900,000 pending cases that grows each day amid the record influx of immigrants converging on the southern border this year. federal authorities arrested about 95,000 migrants in june, down from 133,000 — its highest level since march 2006 — in may.

last month, congress approved a $4.6 billion border-aid bill aimed at easing the stress the crisis has placed on resource-strapped migrant-detention facilities. on wednesday, the pentagon also announced that an additional 2,100 troops will be deployed to the southern border to assist federal authorities.

President Trump Approval Rating Hits Record High in New Poll,9,cgkspq,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-approval-rating-hits-record-high-in-new-poll/,34,1563867021.0,,"president donald trump talks to reporters at the white house, june 26, 2019. (jonathan ernst/reuters)

well into his third year in office, president trump’s approval rating has reached a record high, according to a poll released monday.

trump’s approval rating hit 44 percent in the new npr/newshour/marist poll, the highest level at which it’s been recorded in any mainstream opinion poll with the exception of a a july 7 washington post poll that recorded 47 percent approval.

respondents were surveyed from july 15 to july 17, in the days following the president’s tweet instructing four freshman congresswoman of color to “go back” to their home countries.

since taking office trump’s approval rating has hovered between 35 and 43 percent in the marist poll.

the poll, which included responses from 1,336 adults, also found that trump has won over a small but significant group of independents in the last month. his approval rating among independents increased from 35 percent last month to 42 percent in the latest poll. meanwhile, the percentage of respondents who said they will definitely vote against trump remained unchanged from last month at 53 percent.

while trump gained ground among independents, democrats remain unpopular with the group: 43 percent of respondents in the poll said they believed democrats would take the country in a positive direction if given the opportunity, compared with 46 percent who said the party would lead the country in a negative direction.

“independents are on the fence overall,” said lee miringoff, director of the marist institute for public opinion at marist college. “they’re not willing to grant president trump reelection, and yet they’re not persuaded by democrats at this point.”

while trust in democrats remains low, a number of progressive policy proposals espoused by most of the 2020 democratic presidential contenders performed well. requiring background checks for all gun purchases received 89 percent support. medicare for all who want it received 70 percent support before dropping off to just 41 percent when respondents were told that the proposal would include the elimination of the private insurance market.

more radical progressive proposals such as decriminalizing illegal border crossings (27 percent) and paying reparations to the descendants of slaves (27 percent) proved less popular.

Jane Mayer’s Hollow Defense of Al Franken,0,cgktg9,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/jane-mayers-hollow-defense-of-al-franken/,2,1563867128.0,,"sen. al franken departs the capitol with wife franni after announcing his resignation, december 7, 2017. (yuri gipas/reuters)

over at the new yorker, jane mayer has a lengthy piece in defense of al franken, the former minnesota senator who resigned in disgrace last year after a photo surfaced of him appearing to grope radio host leeann tweeden in her sleep. mayer writes that the democrat “resigned only three weeks after leeann tweeden, a conservative talk-radio host, accused him of having forced an unwanted kiss on her during a 2006 u.s.o. tour,” and, though she acknowledges the existence of the photo, spends most of the piece arguing that franken was the victim of political opportunists on his own side and conservatives who were out to get him.

mayer quotes several of franken’s former colleagues in the senate, democrats who now regret their role in forcing him out of office and who lament in the piece the lack of “due process.” it’s the central theme of mayer’s article: franken never had his day in court.

it’s worth noting that, to this day, the former senator has never denied either forcibly kissing tweeden or posing for the photo in question. both at the time of her allegations and again to mayer, franken tried to cast the incident as a joke gone awry. here’s what mayer writes on that point:

franken tried to devise a response, but, he told me, he found it “impossible to explain the context of the goofing around everybody had been doing, so i just said, ‘it was a joke—it wasn’t funny, and i apologize.’ ” his statement was lambasted on social media as hopelessly inadequate. he released a longer, more self-critical apology. but, he told me, “i was in shock, and i wasn’t thinking as clearly as i should have.” he went on, “you feel very trapped. and the press was just reporting it as she said it.”

the question, then, should not be whether franken received “due process” while the facts were still uncertain. after all, he admitted to having done what he was accused of. both franken and mayer instead seem to think that the punishment didn’t fit the crime, that he got a raw deal.

maybe so. perhaps franken’s treatment of tweeden didn’t merit his colleagues pressuring him to resign from the senate. perhaps his misconduct, having come to light at the same time as various more egregious me too firestorms, was unfairly lumped into a broader cultural desire to “believe all women” and harshly punish any man accused of any sexual misdeed. perhaps he deserved, as he insisted to mayer, a hearing before the senate ethics committee.

but these pleas for sympathy ring hollow coming from a writer like mayer, who has proven herself more than willing to disregard journalistic ethics when the subject of sexual-harassment allegations isn’t on her political team. she published an entire book in 1995 asserting that the george h. w. bush administration engaged in subterfuge to ensure that clarence thomas would be confirmed as a supreme court justice despite anita hill’s accusations against him — never mind that none of hill’s allegations were corroborated.

and for mayer, this is a pattern. much more recently, she co-authored — along with ronan farrow — a new yorker piece revealing the existence of a second sexual-misconduct allegation against brett kavanaugh. his accuser deborah ramirez, mayer and farrow wrote, “was at first hesitant to speak publicly, partly because her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.” (emphasis added.) more from their piece:

in her initial conversations with the new yorker, she was reluctant to characterize kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty. after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away. ramirez is now calling for the f.b.i. to investigate kavanaugh’s role in the incident. “i would think an f.b.i. investigation would be warranted,” she said. (emphasis added.)

it required “six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney” for ramirez to apparently recollect that kavanaugh had exposed himself to her, a fact that should have given pause to any reputable journalist or outlet. meanwhile, mayer and farrow failed to find a single witness who could confirm that kavanaugh had even been at the party, let alone that he behaved as ramirez said he did. the new york times’ subsequent reporting also failed to confirm ramirez’s account, despite contacting several dozen people.

in her piece today, mayer spilled a great deal of ink exploring tweeden’s conservative political sympathies. by contrast, she wrote next to nothing in her article with farrow last summer, noting only that ramirez is a registered democrat, and that she “said that her decision to speak out was not politically motivated.”

mayer, it seems, cares remarkably little about due process or commensurate consequences — unless the man who is punished for his admitted sexual misdeeds shares her political agenda."
"Joe Biden Gets Paid — a Lot — for Speeches, and He’s Not Middle-Class",15,cgkueu,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/07/joe-biden-gets-paid-a-lot-for-speeches-and-hes-not-middle-class/,9,1563867269.0,,"joe biden speaks at an event at iowa wesleyan university in mount pleasant, iowa, june 11, 2019. (jordan gale/reuters)

last october, joe biden traveled to the university of buffalo and delivered a half-hour speech, took questions from the audience for 45 minutes, and signed books. he offered the assembled audience bits of wisdom, such as, “our leaders need to lower the temperature of our public dialogue.”

the university of buffalo foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, paid biden $200,000 for the speech, the q&a, the signing, as well as a photo opportunity, a “meet and greet with up to 16 attendees,” and an interview with reporters to the college newspaper, according to biden’s contract.

advertisement

it was one of several six-figure speaking engagements biden had with colleges and universities in 2017 and 2018. brown university got a relative bargain, with biden reporting $92,642 in income from that appearance. biden reported $100,000 from long island university, $124,515 from southern connecticut state university, $180,000 from vanderbilt university, and $190,000 from drew university.

when you’re a famous former government official, lucrative opportunities abound. in addition to the speeches, the university of pennsylvania paid biden $371,159 in 2017 plus $540,484 in 2018 and early 2019, the philadelphia inquirer reported, “for a vaguely defined role that involved no regular classes and around a dozen public appearances on campus, mostly in big, ticketed events.” biden is being paid two to two-and-a-half times the average salary of a penn professor, and he’s not teaching any classes.

during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle, hillary clinton received some grief about her speaking fees, including a $225,000 fee from a public university where clinton gave a speech lamenting the high cost of a university education.

advertisement

advertisement

the arguments in defense of biden’s recent arrangements will be same ones that people used to defend clinton in 2016: this is normal and standard for retired officeholders of both parties. the universities believe they’re getting a good deal because they gain prestige and news coverage by having a prominent political figure speaking there. after years of allegedly modest six-figure salaries as a senator or cabinet member, a retired lawmaker is entitled to cash in on the public- speaking circuit — separate from their multimillion-dollar book contracts and pensions. (the bidens’ three-book deal with flatiron books is reportedly worth $8 million.)

perhaps clinton and biden would get less grief if president obama hadn’t declared in 2010, “i do think at a certain point you’ve made enough money.” obama himself is charging $400,000 per speech on the lecture circuit.

but perhaps the fact that this is “normal” and “standard” is part of the problem. famous politicians already live in a bubble. in addition to the power and influence that come with their fame and status, they now are virtually guaranteed the ability to rapidly build wealth on par with fortune 500 ceos once they leave office. any retired officeholder can make megabucks for a few years before running for president again — and this creates a legal way for just about anyone with sufficient funds to buy goodwill from a potential future president. none of these universities, nonprofits, or corporations could legally donate six figures to a presidential campaign, but they can pay any politician they like hundreds of thousands of dollars for a day’s work.

advertisement

the former officials may convince themselves that they’ve earned those enormous sums because they’re just so darn charismatic and engaging as speakers. the behavior of those paying suggests otherwise. bill and hillary clinton insisted that their family foundation and the clinton global initiative never had any ulterior motives and and that they never traded favors with the wealthy and powerful. it was, as the washington post observed, “the networking event of choice for corporations, nonprofits, nongovernmental organizations and wealthy philanthropists.” but right after the 2016 election, foreign governments suddenly lost interest in continuing their donations. the australian government said it did not intend to continue its donations to the clinton foundation; it had given $88 million over ten years. after dramatically increasing its yearly donation in 2014 and 2015, the government of norway chose to reduce its donation by 87 percent after the election.

advertisement

at the very least, retired politicians who are making three to four times the median household income for a single speech ought to spare us those never-very-plausible claims of middle-class status, and here biden is a particularly insufferable offender. biden still insists that everyone call him “middle class joe.” he’s clearly on verbal autopilot, and everyone around him is too polite to remind him that he and his wife have had a combined income north of $200,000 since the late 1990s, an income beyond just about all definitions of “middle class.”

advertisement

as the huffington post pointed out in march, news archives reveal that the only person who’s ever called joe biden “middle class joe” is joe biden. and he’s still doing it — at a house party in west des moines on july 15, biden again told the crowd that he’s always been known as “middle class joe.”

biden’s continued insistence that he’s “middle class joe” while raking in $15 million over two years is not quite as insufferable as hillary clinton’s claim that the clintons were “dead broke” when they left the white house. but it’s getting there."

gretna police department chief arthur lawson announced the move in a press conference on monday, saying that the department would not tolerate one of its officers ""alluding to a violent act"" against a sitting congresswomen.

“this incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department,” lawson said while describing officer charlie rispoli's since-deleted facebook post. lawson added that another officer, angelo varisco, was terminated after an internal investigation found he ""liked"" rispoli's post.

rispoli, who had been a member of the gretna police department since 2005, last week shared a facebook post that described ocasio-cortez as a ""vile idiot"" who ""needs a round.""

""and i don't mean the kind she used to serve,"" rispoli said, apparently referencing the lawmaker's past job as a bartender.

the post included a link to a story from taters gonna tate titled ""ocasio-cortez on the budget: 'we pay soldiers too much.'"" the photo on the post included a ""satire"" label.

snopes, a fact-checking website, noted that the publisher frequently shares inflammatory misinformation, and that the story was false. ocasio-cortez has never said the u.s. pays soldiers too much.

rispoli deleted the post on friday and took down his facebook page on saturday, nola.com reported.

lawson said over the weekend that he did not believe rispoli's remarks represented a threat, though he called them ""disturbing.""

""i will tell you this: this will not go unchecked,"" lawson said. ""i’m not going to take this lightly and this will be dealt with on our end. it’s not something we want someone that’s affiliated with our department to make these types of statements. that’s not going to happen.""

rispoli was placed on administrative leave before the gretna police department moved to dismiss him and varisco. lawson said that both of the officers violated the department's social media policies.

“these officers certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional,"" he said.

ocasio-cortez called the post a consequence of president trump donald john trump republican philadelphia official responsible for vote counting says office getting death threats biden will call governors, mayors about mask mandate trump campaign voter fraud hotline flooded with prank calls more's rhetoric against her and some of her freshman colleagues, saying that ""this is trump’s goal when he uses targeted language & threatens elected officials who don’t agree with his political agenda.""

""the president is sowing violence. he’s creating an environment where people can get hurt & he claims plausible deniability,"" she added.

lawson said that capitol police told him no criminal charges would be leveled against the officers, cbs affiliate 4wwl noted."

Many of you have been wondering why r/NeutralNews has been locked to new submissions.

For a long while now, the mods have been discussing among themselves the nature of discourse on this sub and the level of moderation that discourse requires. Our vision for the sub was that it would be a place where people engage in reasonable and measured fact-based discussions of current events, and we feel that mission has not been realized. r/NeutralNews has proven much more difficult for a small team of moderators to manage than the considerably larger sub that spawned it, r/NeutralPolitics. This has led to widespread moderator burnout.

Two months ago, the mods had an extensive discussion about whether to shut down the subreddit. There was a strong contingent in favor, but instead, we decided to enact a series of sweeping reforms in a last ditch effort to get things back on track. Unfortunately, our depleted mod team has left us with a lack of person-hours to implement those reforms. In an effort to get some relief, we've put out a call for new mods on r/NeutralPolitics. Once they are installed, trained, and up to speed, our hope is that it'll free up the rest of us to implement the reforms to r/NeutralNews.

In the meantime, we've had to close the subreddit to new submissions, because it is basically unmoderated now, which reflects poorly on our team and what we're trying to do. The plan is to open it back up with the reforms in place, hopefully within a couple weeks. However, there's still a strong feeling among the mods that it might be better to just shut it down, so if we're unable to implement changes significant enough to improve the quality, that's what we'll do.

If you want to help us get things moving and work to ensure this subreddit's future, we could use some volunteers with experience writing bots, scripts and the like.

Sorry for the late notice on all this. It was a tough week.","dear users,

**Dear r/NeutralNews users,**

Eleven months ago, we [put this subreddit on hiatus](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/cim6kf/meta_the_status_of_rneutralnews/) to address some big, structural problems. We were ridiculously over-optimistic about the timeline for making the required changes, but now we're back!

Please review the [list of reforms we implemented and those that are forthcoming.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi274b/meta_rneutralnews_list_of_reforms/)

Feel free to comment below, but first, here are some anticipated questions and their corresponding answers:

----

**Why did you shut down?**

*In short, it became impossible to moderate this community. The volume of rule-breaking comments was so great that sometimes we'd accumulate hundreds of reports in just a few days, which was too many for our small mod team to review.*

*It also got a bit demoralizing for us to see such blatant and constant violation of our rules, which meant nobody on our team really wanted to moderate this subreddit any longer. That just made the problem worse and discussion quality plummeted.*

*It had started to become just like every other political discussion forum on the internet, with people closed-mindedly yelling at each other. We didn't start this subreddit to provide yet another platform for that, so we had to decide what to do with it.*

*Mods held a vote and the option to implement a sweeping set of reforms to address the problems barely won out over shutting it down altogether.*

**Why are you reopening now?**

*Most of the reforms have been implemented.*

**What are these measures designed to accomplish?**

*Improve discussion quality by making this subreddit easier for a small team to moderate.*

**Why did it take so long?**

*After the initial excitement for the project wore off, the team dwindled and left us with only one developer and one mod working on it. Both of them have lives and jobs, so progress was in fits and starts. These are volunteer positions, after all.*

**How can I help?**

*In a few different ways:*

* *Submit articles. While a discussion forum like /r/NeutralPolitics can survive with occasional gaps between submissions, a news subreddit needs a constant flow of new content. Both previous interations of r/NeutralNews suffered from having only a handful of users who submit articles, meaning the content is dominated by what interests those users. We've taken measures to mitigate that in this latest model by limiting submissions from each individual user, but it won't help diversify the content if nobody else posts; it'll just make the sub less active, which could easily kill it. So, if you run across an interesting news item, please submit it here.*

* *Follow the rules. A good proportion of rule-breaking comments require mod attention. Even if each one only takes a minute for a mod to review in context, make a decision, and take the appropriate action, those minutes add up. Whenever you check yourself and make sure you're complying with the rules, you're not only improving the quality of discussion here, but also contributing to the longevity of this forum by lessening mod workload.*

* *Become a mod. If you like this place and want to help out, consider [applying to become a moderator.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi28xr/meta_rneutralnews_needs_more_moderators/)*

* *Volunteer to code. If you're a developer with spare time and experience with Python, consider helping us improve what we've done and add more features. Send [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralNews)*

* *Provide feedback. Follow the links in this post to [other discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2ckj/meta_request_for_user_feedback_on_specific_rules/) about the changes and comment with your thoughts.*","[this is one in a series of meta posts today, the rest of which are linked throughout the text below.]

As explained in the [main post regarding the relaunch of this subreddit,](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi25c6/meta_rneutralnews_has_relaunched/) we've implemented a slate of reforms designed to improve discussion quality and lessen moderator workload.

A huge thank you to /u/Zyxer22 for all the work he put in to bring these changes about. This project would have been impossible without him. 

Thank you also to /u/ToxicPilot for setting up the database, /u/TrailMagic for the new look and feel, and /u/amoorthy for The Factual bot. Additional thanks to /u/HacksOrSKill, /u/Autoxidation and /u/HR_Paperstacks_402 for their help in the development process. A big and regretful shoutout to /u/gcross for presiding over the downfall of the old republic. 

And finally, thanks to all the users who provided suggestions and moral support in the various feedback threads.

Here are the changes:

---------

**Implemented:**

* Remove the subreddit from r/all and r/popular. (We had done this once before, then experimented with going back to r/all prior to the hiatus. We've reverted that decision.)
* Automation of the monthly feedback thread.
* New source restrictions for submissions via automated whitelist and blacklist. More details [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2bdj/meta_source_restrictions_in_rneutralnews/)
* Partnership with The Factual on their new bot. More details [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2ab8/meta_rneutralnews_has_partnered_with_the_factual/)
* Automated tracking of rule violations for individual users.
* Publication of our [ban policy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_ban_procedures)
* Limit the number of submission from each user in a given time period. (This is currently set at 5 submissions in the previous 7 days, but we can adjust it as necessary.)
* A new system where users can give awards to others based on the merit of a comment. More details [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_awards)
* Update the sub's style to make the rules more prominent on all platforms.

**Planned or contemplated:**

* Implement a verification question to ensure commenters have read the article. (We've collected some good suggestions for how to do this, but of all the proposed reforms, this was the most difficult to implement, so we're launching without it.)
* Implement a whitelist of commenters. To get on the whitelist, you would just need to pass a brief, one-time quiz about this sub's rules.
* Policy change to make repeated violations of [Rules 2 or 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralNews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) a ban-worthy offense.
* Extend merit awards to submissions.
* Use merit award counts to allow more leeway with submission limits and the need to verify one has read the article before commenting.

----

If the above sounds like a lot of barriers to participation, yes, that's the idea. Our experience with r/NeutralPolitics has taught us that rules and barriers increase discussion quality, even at the cost of quantity, while our experience here has taught us the converse is also true.

Nonetheless, feel free to comment below with your feedback on these changes.

[META] r/NeutralNews has partnered with The Factual to run a trial of a relevant new bot,106,hi2ab8,https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2ab8/meta_rneutralnews_has_partnered_with_the_factual/,24,1593474496.0,"As part of our [relaunch,](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi25c6/meta_rneutralnews_has_relaunched/) this subreddit has partnered with [The Factual](https://www.thefactual.com/) to run a trial of their new bot.


**The Factual bot - How It Works**

The Factual bot analyzes 10,000 news articles across hundreds of sources every day to find the most credible stories on trending topics. 

Each article is evaluated by a machine learning algorithm on four dimensions: diversity and extent of sources, neutrality of writing tone, author’s topical expertise, and site’s historical reputation. The resulting percentage score gives readers a guide of how likely an article is to be credible.

The Factual’s rating system is completely automated and minimizes bias by avoiding popularity metrics and personal preferences as inputs (i.e. the model was not trained with articles classified as good or bad as that would encode the creator’s biases). Instead, stories that are deeply-researched, minimally opinionated, and written by topical experts rate highest. In fact, The Factual often uncovers highly-rated stories on smaller focused news sites.

A few guidelines for using The Factual’s ratings:

* The Factual can never say if an article is true or false. Such a determination still requires human judgment. The Factual can only say that an article has the attributes of a highly credible article. 
* The Factual assumes that every article has some bias due to the author’s frame of reference. So The Factual curates a few highly-rated stories across the political spectrum, as well as some in-depth pieces, so readers have more context to get the full story.
* The Factual bot polls postings to NeutralNews every 10 minutes and only rates the original posted story on each thread.

The Factual is not affiliated with any news outlets, or Reddit, and is an independent technology company. The mod team is partnering with The Factual only because it furthers our mutual goals related to online discussion. No remuneration of any kind is taking place. NeutralNews is the first subreddit to test The Factual bot so feedback is greatly appreciated to make the bot more useful to you.

[META] Source restrictions in r/NeutralNews,44,hi2bdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2bdj/meta_source_restrictions_in_rneutralnews/,11,1593474592.0,"Hello r/NeutralNews users.

As part of the [relaunch](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi25c6/meta_rneutralnews_has_relaunched/) and the reforms outlined [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi274b/meta_rneutralnews_list_of_reforms/) this subreddit has implemented new source restrictions for submissions. This is a divergence from the standards of r/NeutralPolitics, the subreddit that spawned this one, which maintains no blacklists, because our experience there has shown that good articles occasionally show up in unlikely places. But our experience here in r/NeutralNews has shown us that allowing any source as the submission can lead to problems, so we're making this change to try to keep discussions on the topic of the news item at hand, not the trustworthiness of the source. Prior to our hiatus, arguments about the source were dominating many conversations, distracting from the topic at hand and occupying a lot of moderator resources to remove them.

The way the new restrictions work is as follows:

* Instead of immediately going live, new submissions get routed to a moderator queue for evaluation. (This is the same way r/NeutralPolitics works, except this forum only accepts link submissions.)
* Our bot examines any new submission in the queue.
* If the domain of the submission is on the blacklist, the submission gets rejected and the submitter is notified.
* If the domain is on the whitelist, the submission gets approved.
* If the domain is on neither list, a human mod reviews it according to a standard procedure (defined below) and may opt to add that source to either list, which means the lists will be continually expanding.

""Who decides what's on the list?"" Not us. There was a lot of discussion and a fair amount of disagreement among the mods about the acceptability of individual sources, which revealed that we really should not be in charge of that and neither should the users. So, we settled on removing ourselves from the decision-making process and instead relying on third party lists. Our starting lists are as follows:

* Blacklist: literal fake news and satire sites, as defined [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites#List)
* Whitelist: sources rated by Wikipedia as ""generally reliable,"" as listed [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources#Sources)
* Criteria to add to either list: domains that are on neither the whitelist or the blacklist will be reviewed against the ratings on [Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC).](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/filtered-search/) A rating of ""Mostly Factual"" or higher gets a domain onto the whitelist and below that goes on the blacklist.

An important point to note is that none of these lists are about bias. Our focus here is solely on sites that are or aren't generally factual. Even on MBFC, we disregard the bias rating and only use the factual one. Also note that the restrictions currently only apply to submissions, not comments. Going forward, we'll evaluate whether it's necessary or appropriate to extend the enforcement to comments.

Yes, there will be objections. Every third party list we considered includes sources that are objectionable to someone, so there will inevitably be some feedback along the lines of, ""Do you really want content from [insert objectionable whitelisted source] on this subreddit?""  The inclusion of a site on the whitelist does not mean the mods want to see articles from that site; only that we will not remove them. Articles from the more obscure sites have never really been submitted to the subreddit with much frequency anyway.

Please don't ask us to add or remove specific sites on a list. We're not making exceptions, because that would open up the door to mods adjudicating the validity of individual sites from now on, which is a surefire way to introduce bias, not to mention very time consuming. If, however, you think other third party lists are more representative of what is factual, feel free to comment with those and tell us why.

""But [insert MSM site here] is totally [insert bias accusation here.]"" OK, but according to [Alexa rankings](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/category/Top/News), some of those are the most popular dedicated news sites on the web. If the concept for how this subreddit works is that people who find articles in the wild submit them here for the rest of the users to peruse, it would present a huge obstacle to the providers of our content if we prohibited the most commonly visited sites.

Finally, please remember is that these lists are only one component in a [series of reforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi274b/meta_rneutralnews_list_of_reforms/) we've implemented. [The Factual bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2ab8/meta_rneutralnews_has_partnered_with_the_factual/) not only rates source articles, but provides alternative sources for the same news item. Submission limits on individual users keep the sub from being dominated by a handful of perspectives. New violations trackers and ban procedures are designed, in part, to prevent bad faith users from promoting discussion from poor source articles. And as always, there are Reddit's upvotes and downvotes. 

In short, blacklists and whitelists are scary, but we've taken great precautions to use them as fairly as possible. We hope you'll agree, but if not, as always, feel free to comment below.

please don't ask us to add or remove specific sites on a list. we're not making exceptions, because that would open up the door to mods adjudicating the validity of individual sites from now on, which is a surefire way to introduce bias, not to mention very time consuming. if, however, you think other third party lists are more representative of what is factual, feel free to comment with those and tell us why.

""but [insert msm site here] is totally [insert bias accusation here.]"" ok, but according to alexa rankings, some of those are the most popular dedicated news sites on the web. if the concept for how this subreddit works is that people who find articles in the wild submit them here for the rest of the users to peruse, it would present a huge obstacle to the providers of our content if we prohibited the most commonly visited sites.

finally, please remember is that these lists are only one component in a series of reforms we've implemented. the factual bot not only rates source articles, but provides alternative sources for the same news item. submission limits on individual users keep the sub from being dominated by a handful of perspectives. new violations trackers and ban procedures are designed, in part, to prevent bad faith users from promoting discussion from poor source articles. and as always, there are reddit's upvotes and downvotes.

in short, blacklists and whitelists are scary, but we've taken great precautions to use them as fairly as possible. we hope you'll agree, but if not, as always, feel free to comment below.

warm regards,

Dear r/NeutralNews users,

As explained in the [main post regarding this reopening,](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi25c6/meta_rneutralnews_has_relaunched/) many of the [changes we implemented](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi274b/meta_rneutralnews_list_of_reforms/) were designed to ease the burdens of moderation, and as such, they needed to be guided by the moderators. But there are some other issues that deal with overall discussion quality on the subreddit and we would like the users' feedback on those:

**Articles behind paywalls.**

The current guidelines say: ""Submissions that link to articles behind paywalls will be removed unless the submitter provides an alternative method of viewing the article for discussion purposes."" 

In the new paradigm, with [source restrictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2bdj/meta_source_restrictions_in_rneutralnews/) and [The Factual bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2ab8/meta_rneutralnews_has_partnered_with_the_factual/) providing alternate sources, should we keep that requirement? Alternately, we could remove it altogether so there's no restriction on articles behind paywalls, or disallow such articles completely.

One of the concerns here is the proliferation of comments from users who haven't read the article because it's paywalled. 

There's also the question of whether there's a difference between soft paywalls that allow a limited number of free articles per month and hard paywalls that require a subscription for all content.

**Unlisted sites.**

The new [source restrictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2bdj/meta_source_restrictions_in_rneutralnews/) provide a blacklist, a whitelist and a resource to look up sites that can be added to either.

Supreme Court Strikes Down Louisiana Abortion Restrictions,37,hi3rm3,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/supreme-court-abortion-louisiana.html,2,1593479048.0,,"michael barbaro

from the new york times, i’m michael barbaro. this is “the daily.”

[music]

today: the supreme court issues its first major ruling on abortion since president trump appointed a conservative majority. adam liptak on what the decision tells us about the court and its chief justice. it’s tuesday, june 30.

adam liptak

i’m starting a recording.

michael barbaro

oh, gorgeous. thank you for doing that. we were all just joking if it’s a monday in june, it’s adam liptak time.

adam liptak

yeah. once in a while, the spotlight swings my way.

michael barbaro

a lot of the time, in june, every year. so adam, tell us about this latest supreme court ruling on monday.

adam liptak

we got a big abortion case and a somewhat surprising abortion case. the court struck down a louisiana abortion restriction law that would have made it much harder for women in that state to get abortions. and the particular law at issue was about admitting privileges — about whether doctors who provide abortions have to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

michael barbaro

right. and adam, we have talked about admitting privileges for doctors who performed abortions in the past. but as a reminder, what is the idea behind them?

adam liptak

it’s a kind of business relationship between a doctor and a hospital. it allows doctors to admit and care for their patients at given hospitals. supporters of admitting privileges laws say that it’s a kind of credentialing function, that you are likely to be a slightly better doctor if a nearby hospital kind of vouches for you by giving you admitting privileges. opponents of admitting privileges laws say they’re a bit of a scam, that abortion is very safe. if you do have to go to a hospital, they say you’re going to be admitted, whether you have a doctor with admitting privileges or not.

michael barbaro

mm-hmm. so the supreme court on monday sided with skeptics of this law who saw it as what you just described, as a kind of fake — something that, in practical terms, was a way to restrict abortion, not make abortion safer by giving the doctors who perform it a formal relationship to a hospital.

adam liptak

yeah, the court basically says it doesn’t provide any benefits. and it imposes enormous costs on the ability of women to have access to their constitutional right to abortion.

michael barbaro

mm-hmm. you know, on the surface, adam, this case doesn’t seem all that legally complicated, if i know my supreme court history well from talking to you for now three years. which is that time and time again, the supreme court has ruled that states cannot place an undue burden on a woman’s right to have an abortion. and a law like this in louisiana would seem to place a significant burden on a woman’s ability to have an abortion.

adam liptak

well, there’s a good reason to think that, michael. because the supreme court in 2016, in a case involving the identical law but in texas, said exactly that — said that that texas law did impose an undue burden, and it struck down the law. two things made opponents of abortion hopeful that the court would come to a different conclusion just four years later. president trump has appointed a couple of justices. and president trump has said he’s committing to appointing justices who will do away with abortion rights and overrule roe v. wade, the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion. and we also knew that chief justice roberts, in the texas case, had dissented. he was prepared to uphold this very same law in the texas setting. so the surprise on monday was that the chief justice, as it were, switched sides. that’s a bit of an overstatement. but he said, listen, we have a precedent. the rule of law requires us to uphold precedent, except for very good reasons. and here, even though i’d gone the other way in 2016, i’m going to live with that precedent today and vote with the four more liberal members of the court to strike down the louisiana law.

michael barbaro

so chief justice roberts is saying, even though i didn’t agree with a very similar case a few years ago, i am bound by the precedent that that ruling i disagree with created for the louisiana law.

adam liptak

exactly right. so here’s what the chief justice said: i joined the dissent in the texas case, and continue to believe the case was wrongly decided. the question today, however, is not whether that texas case was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case.

michael barbaro

hm. so there’s something a little bit grudging about this.

adam liptak

yeah, i suppose grudging is one word for it. another is principled. you know, this is a chief justice who’s deeply concerned about the institutional integrity of the supreme court, doesn’t want to have it seen as a political body that changes positions depending on changes in personnel. so it may well be that he wasn’t happy to find himself in this position. but at the same time, he might have been sending an important message about the court.

michael barbaro

but of course, not every justice voted that way. so adam, help me understand the thinking of the conservative justices who dissented in this case and disagreed with roberts that the texas case created a binding precedent that should be applied to the louisiana law.

adam liptak

yeah, so everybody agrees, everybody on both sides agrees that this is the same law. it has the same words. but the dissenters say louisiana is different from texas. the evidence in the case was different. the nature of the state is different. and so justice samuel alito, serving the evidence in the louisiana case, says, at least in that case, quote, “there is ample evidence in the record showing that admitting privileges helped to protect the health of women by ensuring that physicians who perform abortions meet higher standards of competence than is shown by the mere possession of a license to practice.” so alito is saying that in louisiana, this makes a difference. and the evidence in the record, he says, shows that it makes a difference.

michael barbaro

mm-hmm. i mean, does that represent a disregard for precedent in your mind? because i remember the hearings for almost each and every one of these conservative justices. and they were all asked over the past decade or so about the role of precedent. and i’m thinking back in particular to two of the conservative justices who dissented in this case — neil gorsuch, brett kavanaugh. and both of them were specifically asked by senate democrats during confirmation hearings about the role of precedent when it came to abortion. and here they seem to be saying that the precedent doesn’t apply.

adam liptak

yeah, so i guess i want to stop at the very beginning of that analysis, michael. i don’t think they’re quite saying that. i mean, i think that’s the music of the decision. but really, what they’re saying is we can live with the precedent, but we’re good lawyers. and we’ll distinguish that precedent. and when we apply it to a different set of facts in a different state, we’re going to come to a different conclusion.

michael barbaro

got it. i’m curious what the practical implications of this ruling are on the ground, pretty much across the country, now the court has ruled that the louisiana law is unconstitutional.

adam liptak

it would seem to rule out this particular kind of abortion restriction. now that texas has lost and louisiana has lost, we’re not going to see states enacting admitting privileges restrictions, although creative opponents of abortion rights will find other ways to try to restrict the procedure.

michael barbaro

mm-hmm. but this particular brand of restriction is now probably going to go away.

adam liptak

you would think so.

michael barbaro

and what about in louisiana, where this case originated?

adam liptak

well, what would have been really striking in louisiana is what would have happened if the case went the other way. louisiana currently has three abortion clinics. that would have gone to one. and it currently has about five doctors who are willing to provide abortion. and that also would apparently have gone to one. so it would have required every woman in the state to travel to new orleans to get abortions. and it’s not clear that that clinic would have had the capacity to serve those women, even if they could make what, in some instances, would be a very long drive — five hours each way — and do it twice. because louisiana also has a law requiring a waiting period between the initial consultation and the procedure itself.

[music]

so i mean, we start with this law that sounds kind of basic, standard, unexceptional. the doctors should have admitting privileges. but it turns out that when you drill down, it’s a vastly consequential restriction on abortion rights.

michael barbaro

we’ll be right back. adam, we are now well into a series of very consequential rulings in a term that you have described as the most consequential since a conservative majority arrived on the court under president trump. so how does this abortion ruling fit into the emerging picture we have of this conservative majority court?

adam liptak

well, we have a conservative majority court — and you’re quite right to say that’s what it is — delivering in the space of two weeks three big liberal victories: on job protections for l.g.b.t.q. workers, on protection from deportation for young immigrants known as dreamers, and now this abortion case. so we have a court that is full of surprises.

michael barbaro

right. and in each case, it was a member of the conservative majority that proved decisive.

adam liptak

right. well, it sort of can’t be otherwise. because it’s a 5-4 court with the four liberals in the minority. so they have to pick up at least one conservative justice to prevail. so in the employment discrimination case, they picked up not only the chief justice, but also justice gorsuch — one of the trump appointees — who actually wrote the majority decision. in the dreamers case, the daca case, they picked up chief justice john roberts, who wrote the majority opinion. and now in the abortion case, they again picked up chief justice john roberts, who voted with the majority but didn’t join its reasoning.

michael barbaro

i’m curious why this keeps happening — that the liberal wing of the court keeps picking up these conservative justices. and the reason i ask this is because we have talked so many times with you, adam, and with our colleagues about the intense vetting process that has led to conservative justices making it into the pipeline for the supreme court, getting picked and then confirmed. and my sense is that the conservative legal apparatus is extremely careful about this vetting process. and it expects these judges — and tell me if i’m oversimplifying — to vote consistently and conservatively. and yet.

adam liptak

so you’re right, michael. it’s extraordinary. the conservative legal movement has put so much energy into identifying people they can count on, who will vote the way they want. and the vetting process is intense. and the reason the confirmation battles are so heated is because people on both sides are convinced that once one of these people gets on the court, they will vote in a right-wing direction. but it turns out that if you put a serious judge on the supreme court and give him or her life tenure, they are going to follow their judicial commitments, sometimes in directions that aren’t political, but are legal. and so in these three cases, they’re all different, but they all conform to jurisprudential commitments of the justices who voted that way. so in the employment discrimination case, justice gorsuch thinks the law simply means what it says. and he couldn’t get away from that. and that’s a conservative idea. in the daca case, chief justice roberts thought the trump administration simply hadn’t offered an adequate reason for winding down the program. that’s also a conservative idea. and then in this latest case, the abortion case, chief justice roberts said, listen, we have a precedent on point. we’re supposed to follow precedent. that’s basically a conservative idea. so depending on how you think about these cases, they may be politically liberal, but in an important sense, judicially conservative.

michael barbaro

i have to imagine that the greatest disappointment for this right-wing legal apparatus that you described is with justice roberts. because he has been the most consistent swing vote to swing over to the liberals. and i hear you just saying that he’s coming up with a conservative legal rationale in each decision. but i have to imagine this pattern is complicating his reputation with the people who supported his nomination.

adam liptak

oh, that’s way an understatement.

archived recording (tom cotton) chief justice roberts consistently seems more concerned about the reputation of the court and his reputation among democrats and the media than the rule of law.

adam liptak

the right-wing — the conservative legal movement, senator ted cruz, senator tom cotton — are furious with john roberts.

archived recording (tom cotton) i would recommend that he resign and travel to iowa for the caucuses and see if he can earn the votes of his fellow americans.

adam liptak

i mean, maybe they could forgive him his two votes for upholding the affordable care act. maybe they could forgive him in the census case for not letting the trump administration add a question on citizenship.

archived recording (ted cruz) judging is not a game. but sadly, over recent years, more and more chief justice roberts has been playing games.

adam liptak

but to come to three liberal conclusions in the space of two weeks, in three different blockbuster cases, is a bitter, bitter pill for them to swallow.

michael barbaro

mm. and they’re saying so.

adam liptak

sure. but here’s the thing, michael. roberts, in moving to the center of the court, has become the most powerful chief justice since at least 1937.

michael barbaro

wow.

adam liptak

the idea of both being the chief justice and the swing justice, as it were, is almost unheard of. but what you have in chief justice roberts is someone who’s been in the majority 98 percent of the time so far this term.

michael barbaro

wow.

adam liptak

and he’s been in the majority in every 5-4 decision so far, which looks like it will set a record for a chief justice if it lasts through the end of the term.

michael barbaro

hm. so perhaps he has alienated the right, but he has amassed a tremendous amount of influence as a justice on this court.

adam liptak

yes. i mean, people talk about the roberts court because you always talk about the court by the name of the chief justice. but this is really the roberts court in a second sense, too, that john roberts is driving this train.

michael barbaro

you established a narrative for us about a year ago, adam, around this question of john roberts. and you accurately predicted he might end up being a swing vote on a question like abortion. and when we have talked about him, you said that he prizes the reputation of the supreme court as a nonpartisan institution, and that he might prize that reputation above his own, kind of the most natural, legal instincts. is that what you think may be at play here? or is it possible that we just didn’t quite understand his legal instincts the entire time?

adam liptak

i think a large part of what explains this is what john roberts goes around saying all the time and nobody takes seriously.

archived recording (chief justice john g. roberts jr.) [applause] thank you very much. thank you.

adam liptak

that the court is not a political institution —

archived recording (chief justice john g. roberts jr.) we do not speak for the people. but we speak for the constitution. our role is very clear.

adam liptak

and i think he’s demonstrating that commitment — that these are not sort of empty civics lesson statements that he makes in his public comments, but that he is authentically committed to them.

archived recording (chief justice john g. roberts jr.) we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. we do not caucus in separate rooms. we do not serve one party or one interest. we serve one nation. and i want to assure all of you that we will continue to do that to the best of our abilities, whether times are calm or contentious. thanks very much. [applause]

adam liptak

i think he earnestly believes in the legal conclusions he’s drawn. but at least incidentally, it helps maintain the institutional prestige, authority, legitimacy of the supreme court if it doesn’t break along predictable ideological lines.

michael barbaro

mm-hmm. so in a way, he’s being the change he wants to see, which does fit with who he is, but may also stretch who he is.

adam liptak

yeah, ok.

michael barbaro

[laughs] adam, it feels like from everything you’re saying about chief justice john roberts that we may be getting an answer to the biggest question of all, about how he may rule, which is on any kind of challenge to roe v. wade. because the rulings of the past couple weeks, and especially the ruling on the louisiana law, suggest that he favors precedent, does not want to polarize the country. and collectively, that would all suggest — tell me if i’m wrong here — that he would be inclined to support the precedent that is roe v. wade if it is challenged.

adam liptak

well, so i think we have some substantial evidence for that proposition in today’s ruling. he took precedent very seriously in an abortion case. but it’s not as though john roberts has never voted to overrule precedent. he voted to overrule precedent in citizens united and in other cases. and he set out a fairly elaborate set of principles for when precedents can be overruled. and it’s not clear to me that just because he thought this one precedent, which is trivial in comparison to the abortion rights itself in roe, will give you the answer of how we will treat roe. so i wouldn’t count any chickens here. but there is more evidence monday than there was last week that the chief justice takes precedent quite seriously.

[music]

michael barbaro

well, adam, thank you very much. we appreciate it.

adam liptak

yes, thank you.

michael barbaro

on monday evening, both the white house and president trump’s campaign issued statements denouncing the supreme court’s ruling on abortion. without naming him, the statement from the campaign appeared to criticize chief justice roberts, saying, quote, “five unelected supreme court justices decided to insert their political agenda in place of democratically determined policies.” we’ll be right back. here’s what else you need to know today. global deaths from the coronavirus have now surpassed 500,000, prompting a new wave of restrictions. china imposed a strict lockdown on nearly half a million people in a county south of beijing in an effort to contain an outbreak there that is challenging the country’s claim to have beaten back the virus. in the u.s., several states moved to delay reopenings.

archived recording (phil murphy) we must hit pause on the resumption of indoor dining.

michael barbaro

in new jersey, governor phil murphy scrapped a plan to open restaurants for limited indoor dining later this week, saying it posed too great a risk.

archived recording (phil murphy) given the current situation in numerous other states, we do not believe it is prudent at this time to push forward with what is, in effect, a sedentary indoor activity, especially when we know that this virus moves differently indoors than out, making it even more deadly.

michael barbaro

and the times reports that intelligence officials gave president trump a written briefing months ago, laying out their conclusion that russia offered and paid out bounties to militants in afghanistan to kill u.s. and coalition troops there. so far, trump has denied ever being briefed on the russian bounties. but the intelligence has provoked a furor, because the russian bounties may be linked to the death of three u.s. marines in afghanistan, and because the white house has not authorized any response.

Supreme Court strikes down Louisiana abortion clinic law,291,hi3wk8,https://apnews.com/c9c6eee97277d6e8e71f568cde830e46,17,1593479434.0,,"washington (ap) — a divided supreme court on monday struck down a louisiana law regulating abortion clinics, reasserting a commitment to abortion rights over fierce opposition from dissenting conservative justices in the first big abortion case of the trump era.

chief justice john roberts and his four more liberal colleagues ruled that a law that requires doctors who perform abortions must have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals violates abortion rights the court first announced in the landmark roe v. wade decision in 1973.

the outcome is far from the last word on the decades-long fight over abortion with dozens of state-imposed restrictions winding their way through the courts. but the decision was a surprising defeat for abortion opponents, who thought that a new conservative majority with two of president donald trump’s appointees on board would start chipping away at abortion access.

the key vote belonged to roberts, who had always voted against abortion rights before, including in a 2016 case in which the court struck down a texas law that was virtually identical to the one in louisiana.

the chief justice explained that he continues to think the texas case was wrongly decided, but believes it’s important for the court to stand by its prior decisions.

“the result in this case is controlled by our decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical texas law,” roberts wrote. he did not join the opinion written by justice stephen breyer for the other liberals in monday’s decision, and his position left abortion-rights supporters more relieved than elated.

the case was t he third in two weeks in which roberts, a george w. bush appointee, joined the court’s liberals in the majority . one of the earlier decisions preserved the legal protections and work authorization for 650,000 immigrants who were brought to the u.s. as children. the other extended federal employment-discrimination protections to lgbt americans, a decision that justice neil gorsuch also joined and wrote.

in dissent on monday, justice clarence thomas wrote, “today a majority of the court perpetuates its ill-founded abortion jurisprudence by enjoining a perfectly legitimate state law and doing so without jurisdiction.”

trump’s two high-court picks, gorsuch and brett kavanaugh, were in dissent, along with samuel alito. the presence of the new justices is what had fueled hopes among abortion opponents , and fears on the other side, that the supreme court would be more likely to uphold restrictions.

the trump administration had sided with louisiana in urging the court to uphold the law. white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany criticized the decision. “in an unfortunate ruling today, the supreme court devalued both the health of mothers and the lives of unborn children by gutting louisiana’s policy that required all abortion procedures be performed by individuals with admitting privileges at a nearby hospital,” mcenany said.

marjorie dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion susan b. anthony list, said, “today’s ruling is a bitter disappointment. it demonstrates once again the failure of the supreme court to allow the american people to protect the well-being of women from the tentacles of a brutal and profit-seeking abortion industry.”

advertisement

on the other side, support for the decision mixed with a wariness that the future of abortion rights appears to rest with roberts.

nancy northup, president and ceo of the center for reproductive rights, said monday’s decision by no means ends the struggle over abortion rights in legislatures and the courts.

“we’re relieved that the louisiana law has been blocked today but we’re concerned about tomorrow. with this win, the clinics in louisiana can stay open to serve the one million women of reproductive age in the state. but the court’s decision could embolden states to pass even more restrictive laws when clarity is needed if abortion rights are to be protected,” northup said.

in his reasoning, roberts “signaled a willingness to lessen the legal protections for abortion,” university of michigan law professor leah litman wrote on the take care blog. however, she also acknowledged that roberts’ “emphasis on the importance of adhering to the court’s prior decisions does not sound like the thinking of a person who is inclined to overrule roe v. wade.”

a trial judge had said the law would not provide health benefits to women and would leave only one clinic open in louisiana, in new orleans. that would make it too hard for women to get abortions, in violation of the constitution, the judge ruled.

but the appeals court in new orleans rejected the judge’s findings and upheld the law in 2018, doubting that any clinics would have to close and saying that doctors had not tried hard enough to establish relationships with local hospitals.

the clinics filed an emergency appeal at the supreme court, asking that the law be blocked while the justices evaluated the case.

early last year, roberts joined with the four liberal members of the court to grant that request and keep the law on hold.

roberts’ vote was a bit of a surprise because of his earlier vote n the texas case. it may have reflected his new role since justice anthony kennedy’s retirement as the court’s swing justice, his concern about the court being perceived as a partisan institution and his respect for a prior decision of the court, even one he disagreed with. roberts didn’t write anything explaining his position at the time of the texas case.

the regulations at issue in louisiana are distinct from other state laws making their way through court challenges that would ban abortions early in a pregnancy. those include bans on abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as 6 weeks, and the almost total ban passed in alabama."
Boeing 737 MAX begins key certification test flights,18,hi4bgg,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-737max/boeing-737-max-begins-key-certification-test-flights-idUSKBN2402CF?il=0,2,1593480619.0,,"seattle/washington (reuters) - boeing co began a series of long-delayed flight tests of its redesigned 737 max with regulators at the controls on monday, hoping to win approval and rebuild its reputation after fatal crashes that toppled its leaders and grounded the jet worldwide.

pilots from the u.s. faa and boeing landed around 2:15 p.m. local time at king county international airport, also known as boeing field, after a round trip to eastern washington that included a high-speed system test and other maneuvers over about three hours.

reuters first reported the long-awaited certification test flights, scheduled over three days, were set to start on monday, a pivotal moment in boeing’s worst-ever corporate crisis triggered by twin crashes that killed 346 people in ethiopia and indonesia.

boeing shares closed 14.4% higher at $194.49 on monday, helping boost the dow jones industrial average. [.n]

after the flights are completed, the faa must analyze reams of test data and approve new pilot training procedures, among other reviews, and would not likely approve the plane’s ungrounding until september, industry and government sources say.

if that happens, the jet is on a path to resume u.s. service before year-end, though the process has been plagued by delays for more than a year.

boeing did not publicize monday’s take off, saying the faa was leading the 737 max testing process. the business-as-usual atmosphere at boeing field illustrated a shift in boeing’s communications strategy on the 737 max since last year when it strained its relationship with the federal aviation administration by issuing public statements that predicted the timeline for the jet’s return.

the crisis has cost boeing billions of dollars, slashed production and hobbled its supply chain, with criminal and congressional investigations still playing out. in december, boeing fired chief executive dennis muilenburg after scrutiny into the jet’s design and development tarnished its reputation with airlines and regulators.

the 737 max gaining faa approval to return to commercial service is expected to spark a scramble by boeing to determine the fate of hundreds of parked jets.

there are some 450 jets that boeing is eager to deliver once the max is cleared to fly, though experts say the prospect of moving those quickly has been diminished by the coronavirus crisis.

airlines have also grounded a further 385 jets in their fleets, and u.s. carriers have said it will take them between 30 and 60 days after regulatory approval to prepare their jets and pilots for flight.

a central task for the faa is to validate boeing’s upgrades to the mcas anti-stall system faulted in both crashes, as well as perform a wide array of flight maneuvers and emergency procedures, the faa said.

the agency said it will “lift the grounding order only after we are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.”

after taking off from boeing field, the crew, which included boeing commercial airplanes chief pilot jim webb, tested slow flight conditions between 12,000 feet and 15,000 feet, a person familiar with the flight said. later, they boosted airspeed to 470 knots at 14,000 feet to conduct high-speed system tests, a person familiar with the flight said.

the goal was likely a test of whether pilots were able to manually adjust the tail’s horizontal stabilizer at high speeds - a key focus during crash investigations because pilots struggled to make adjustments at high speeds while also trying to counteract mcas."
Another Fatal Shooting in Seattle’s ‘CHOP’ Protest Zone,41,hi4evw,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/seattle-protests-CHOP-CHAZ-autonomous-zone.html,3,1593480891.0,,"the city has said it wants a return to normal in the occupied protest zone, and a reopening of the police department’s east precinct station, which was boarded up and abandoned as residents of several blocks were left to police themselves. work crews with heavy equipment arrived on friday to begin taking down barriers that were set up by protesters after the killing of george floyd in minneapolis in late may. but work was halted to avoid a confrontation.

mayor jenny durkan, a former united states attorney under president barack obama, has been criticized from both the left and right for her handling of the protests and the situation in the chop in particular. at least three members of the nine-person city council have called for her resignation over the police response to the protests, and president trump tweeted that seattle is out of control.

at least one lawsuit has been filed against the mayor and gov. jay inslee, claiming that allowing the chop zone to emerge put people living in the area in danger. a crowd of protesters converged on the mayor’s house on sunday, chanting for her to step down.

the first shooting occurred early on the morning of june 20. a 19-year-old man was shot and transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. a 33-year-old man was also shot nearby."

Reddit bans r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse as part of a major expansion of its rules,189,hibdl7,https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21304947/reddit-ban-subreddits-the-donald-chapo-trap-house-new-content-policy-rules?utm_source=digg,32,1593501712.0,,"reddit will ban r/the_donald, r/chapotraphouse, and about 2,000 other communities today after updating its content policy to more explicitly ban hate speech. the policy update comes three weeks after black lives matter protests led several popular reddit forums to go dark temporarily in protest of what they called the company’s lax policies around hosting and promoting racist content. it marks a major reversal for a company whose commitment to free expression has historically been so strong that it once allowed users to distribute stolen nude photos freely on the site.

“i have to admit that i’ve struggled with balancing my values as an american, and around free speech and free expression, with my values and the company’s values around common human decency,” reddit ceo steve huffman said in a call with reporters.

in a blog post that cites the company’s new rules, huffman said users of the r/the_donald subreddit had violated the site’s policies for years. (the site has no official connection to president donald trump, although he did do an ask me anything there as a candidate in 2016.) “the community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations,” huffman said.

similarly, r/chapotraphouse had also hosted content that violates the site’s rules, huffman said. the subreddit is a spinoff of the popular left-wing podcast.

reddit’s new policy begins with a first rule that requires users to “consider the human.” it reads:

remember the human. reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. everyone has a right to use reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. communities and people that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.

that formed the basis of a policy framework that bans hate speech.

“reddit’s mission is to bring community and belonging to everybody in the world, and there is speech in the world and on reddit that prevents other people from doing so,” huffman told reporters. “harassing speech or hateful speech prevents people from coming to reddit and feeling safe and sharing their vulnerabilities ... so if we have speech on reddit that’s preventing people from using reddit the way that we intend it to be used, or that prevents us from achieving our mission, then it’s actually a very easy decision.”

the introduction of the new policies has resulted in the removal of about 2,000 subreddits so far, and the company says “the vast majority” were inactive. only about 200 of them had more than 10 daily users, the company said. they include:

r/darkhumorandmemes

r/consumeproduct

r/darkjokecentral

r/gendercritical

r/cumtown

r/imgoingtohellforthis2

r/wojak

r/soyboys

last year, reddit “quarantined” r/the_donald, placing it behind a warning screen after it was found to host content that incited violence. the company had previously prevented posts on the forum from reaching reddit’s front page. former users of the forum began moving to a new site off reddit last year.

while monday’s removals hit some high-profile political communities, huffman said the company would continue to support a broad range of political speech.

“political speech continues to be safe,” huffman said. “but all communities, including our political communities, have to abide by our policies. and while we will do everything we can to help bring them in line, if they fail in doing so they are not allowed on reddit.”

while r/the_donald has no official connection to trump, reddit’s move could draw the ire of the president. trump’s campaign complained after snap removed him from promotion in snapchat’s discover tab earlier this month, and after twitter began placing warnings on some of the president’s tweets.

at the same time, the company has been under more pressure to remove hate speech. among the critics has been former reddit ceo ellen pao, who earlier this month said r/the_donald should have been removed long ago. “you should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence,” she said in a tweet directed at huffman. “so much of what is happening now lies at your feet. you don’t get to say blm when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long.”"
"From pandering to Putin to abusing allies and ignoring his own advisers, Trump's phone calls alarm US officials",46,hibxec,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/politics/trump-phone-calls-national-security-concerns/index.html,7,1593503660.0,[deleted],"(cnn) in hundreds of highly classified phone calls with foreign heads of state, president donald trump was so consistently unprepared for discussion of serious issues, so often outplayed in his conversations with powerful leaders like russian president vladimir putin and turkish president recep erdogan, and so abusive to leaders of america's principal allies, that the calls helped convince some senior us officials -- including his former secretaries of state and defense, two national security advisers and his longest-serving chief of staff -- that the president himself posed a danger to the national security of the united states, according to white house and intelligence officials intimately familiar with the contents of the conversations.

the calls caused former top trump deputies -- including national security advisers h.r. mcmaster and john bolton, defense secretary james mattis, secretary of state rex tillerson, and white house chief of staff john kelly, as well as intelligence officials -- to conclude that the president was often ""delusional,"" as two sources put it, in his dealings with foreign leaders. the sources said there was little evidence that the president became more skillful or competent in his telephone conversations with most heads of state over time. rather, he continued to believe that he could either charm, jawbone or bully almost any foreign leader into capitulating to his will, and often pursued goals more attuned to his own agenda than what many of his senior advisers considered the national interest.

these officials' concerns about the calls, and particularly trump's deference to putin , take on new resonance with reports the president may have learned in march that russia had offered the taliban bounties to kill us troops in afghanistan -- and yet took no action. cnn's sources said there were calls between putin and trump about trump's desire to end the american military presence in afghanistan but they mentioned no discussion of the supposed taliban bounties.

by far the greatest number of trump's telephone discussions with an individual head of state were with erdogan, who sometimes phoned the white house at least twice a week and was put through directly to the president on standing orders from trump, according to the sources. meanwhile, the president regularly bullied and demeaned the leaders of america's principal allies, especially two women: telling prime minister theresa may of the united kingdom she was weak and lacked courage; and telling german chancellor angela merkel that she was ""stupid.""

trump incessantly boasted to his fellow heads of state, including saudi arabia's autocratic royal heir mohammed bin salman and north korean dictator kim jong un, about his own wealth, genius, ""great"" accomplishments as president, and the ""idiocy"" of his oval office predecessors, according to the sources.

in his conversations with both putin and erdogan, trump took special delight in trashing former presidents george w. bush and barack obama and suggested that dealing directly with him -- trump -- would be far more fruitful than during previous administrations. ""they didn't know bs,"" he said of bush and obama -- one of several derisive tropes the sources said he favored when discussing his predecessors with the turkish and russian leaders.

then-national security adviser john bolton listens to president donald trump during a meeting with egyptian president abdel-fattah el-sisi in april 2019.

the full, detailed picture drawn by cnn's sources of trump's phone calls with foreign leaders is consistent with the basic tenor and some substantive elements of a limited number of calls described by former national security adviser john bolton in his book , ""the room where it happened."" but the calls described to cnn cover a far longer period than bolton's tenure, are much more comprehensive — and seemingly more damning -- in their sweep.

like bolton, cnn's sources said that the president seemed to continually conflate his own personal interests -- especially for purposes of re-election and revenge against perceived critics and political enemies -- with the national interest.

to protect the anonymity of those describing the calls for this report, cnn will not reveal their job titles nor quote them at length directly. more than a dozen officials either listened to the president's phone calls in real time or were provided detailed summaries and rough-text recording printouts of the calls soon after their completion, cnn's sources said. the sources were interviewed by cnn repeatedly over a four-month period extending into june.

the sources did cite some instances in which they said trump acted responsibly and in the national interest during telephone discussions with some foreign leaders. cnn reached out to kelly, mcmaster and tillerson for comment and received no response as of monday afternoon. mattis did not comment.

the white house did not respond to a request for comment before this story published. after publication, white house deputy press secretary sarah matthews said, ""president trump is a world class negotiator who has consistently furthered america's interests on the world stage. from negotiating the phase one china deal and the usmca to nato allies contributing more and defeating isis, president trump has shown his ability to advance america's strategic interests.""

one person familiar with almost all the conversations with the leaders of russia, turkey, canada, australia and western europe described the calls cumulatively as 'abominations' so grievous to us national security interests that if members of congress heard from witnesses to the actual conversations or read the texts and contemporaneous notes, even many senior republican members would no longer be able to retain confidence in the president.

attacking key ally leaders -- especially women

the insidious effect of the conversations comes from trump's tone, his raging outbursts at allies while fawning over authoritarian strongmen, his ignorance of history and lack of preparation as much as it does from the troubling substance, according to the sources. while in office, then- director of national intelligence dan coats expressed worry to subordinates that trump's telephone discussions were undermining the coherent conduct of foreign relations and american objectives around the globe, one of cnn's sources said. and in recent weeks, former chief of staff kelly has mentioned the damaging impact of the president's calls on us national security to several individuals in private.

two sources compared many of the president's conversations with foreign leaders to trump's recent press ""briefings"" on the coronavirus pandemic: free form, fact-deficient stream-of-consciousness ramblings, full of fantasy and off-the-wall pronouncements based on his intuitions, guesswork, the opinions of fox news tv hosts and social media misinformation.

in addition to merkel and may, the sources said, trump regularly bullied and disparaged other leaders of the western alliance during his phone conversations -- including french president emmanuel macron, canadian prime minister justin trudeau, and australian prime minister scott morrison -- in the same hostile and aggressive way he discussed the coronavirus with some of america's governors.

president donald trump and french president emmanuel macron at a meeting in london in december 2019.

next to erdogan, no foreign leader initiated more calls with trump than macron, the sources said, with the french president often trying to convince trump to change course on environmental and security policy matters -- including climate change and us withdrawal from the iranian multilateral nuclear accord.

macron usually got ""nowhere"" on substantive matters, while trump became irritated at the french president's stream of requests and subjected him to self-serving harangues and lectures that were described by one source as personalized verbal ""whippings,"" especially about france and other countries not meeting nato spending targets, their liberal immigration policies or their trade imbalances with the us.

but his most vicious attacks, said the sources, were aimed at women heads of state. in conversations with both may and merkel, the president demeaned and denigrated them in diatribes described as ""near-sadistic"" by one of the sources and confirmed by others. ""some of the things he said to angela merkel are just unbelievable: he called her 'stupid,' and accused her of being in the pocket of the russians ... he's toughest [in the phone calls] with those he looks at as weaklings and weakest with the ones he ought to be tough with.""

the calls ""are so unusual,"" confirmed a german official, that special measures were taken in berlin to ensure that their contents remained secret. the official described trump's behavior with merkel in the calls as ""very aggressive"" and said that the circle of german officials involved in monitoring merkel's calls with trump has shrunk: ""it's just a small circle of people who are involved and the reason, the main reason, is that they are indeed problematic.""

german chancellor angela merkel and president donald trump speak during the g-7 summit in biarritz, france, in august 2019.

trump's conversations with may, the uk prime minister from 2016 to 2019, were described as ""humiliating and bullying,"" with trump attacking her as ""a fool"" and spineless in her approach to brexit, nato and immigration matters.

""he'd get agitated about something with theresa may, then he'd get nasty with her on the phone call,"" one source said. ""it's the same interaction in every setting -- coronavirus or brexit -- with just no filter applied.""

merkel remained calm and outwardly unruffled in the face of trump's attacks —""like water off a duck's back,"" in the words of one source -- and she regularly countered his bluster with recitations of fact. the german official quoted above said that during merkel's visit to the white house two years ago, trump displayed ""very questionable behavior"" that ""was quite aggressive ... [t]he chancellor indeed stayed calm, and that's what she does on the phone.""

prime minister may, in contrast, became ""flustered and nervous"" in her conversations with the president. ""he clearly intimidated her and meant to,"" said one of cnn's sources. in response to a request for comment about trump's behavior in calls with may, the uk's downing street referred cnn to its website. the site lists brief descriptions of the content of some calls and avoids any mention of tone or tension. the french embassy in washington declined to comment, while the russian and turkish embassies did not respond to requests for comment.

concerns over calls with putin and erdogan

the calls with putin and erdogan were particularly egregious in terms of trump almost never being prepared substantively and thus leaving him susceptible to being taken advantage of in various ways, according to the sources -- in part because those conversations (as with most heads of state), were almost certainly recorded by the security services and other agencies of their countries.

in his phone exchanges with putin, the sources reported, the president talked mostly about himself, frequently in over-the-top, self-aggrandizing terms: touting his ""unprecedented"" success in building the us economy; asserting in derisive language how much smarter and ""stronger"" he is than ""the imbeciles"" and ""weaklings"" who came before him in the presidency (especially obama); reveling in his experience running the miss universe pageant in moscow, and obsequiously courting putin's admiration and approval. putin ""just outplays"" him, said a high-level administration official -- comparing the russian leader to a chess grandmaster and trump to an occasional player of checkers. while putin ""destabilizes the west,"" said this source, the president of the united states ""sits there and thinks he can build himself up enough as a businessman and tough guy that putin will respect him."" (at times, the putin-trump conversations sounded like ""two guys in a steam bath,"" a source added.)

president donald trump and russian president vladimir putin arrive for a meeting in helsinki in july 2018.

in numerous calls with putin that were described to cnn, trump left top national security aides and his chiefs of staff flabbergasted, less because of specific concessions he made than because of his manner -- inordinately solicitous of putin's admiration and seemingly seeking his approval -- while usually ignoring substantive policy expertise and important matters on the standing bilateral agenda, including human rights; and an arms control agreement, which never got dealt with in a way that advanced shared russian and american goals that both putin and trump professed to favor, cnn's sources said.

throughout his presidency, trump has touted the theme of ""america first"" as his north star in foreign policy, advancing the view that america's allies and adversaries have taken economic advantage of us goodwill in trade. and that america's closest allies need to increase their share of collective defense spending. he frequently justifies his seeming deference to putin by arguing that russia is a major world player and that it is in the united states' interest to have a constructive and friendly relationship -- requiring a reset with moscow through his personal dialogue with putin.

in separate interviews, two high-level administration officials familiar with most of the trump-putin calls said the president naively elevated russia -- a second-rate totalitarian state with less than 4% of the world's gdp -- and its authoritarian leader almost to parity with the united states and its president by undermining the tougher, more realistic view of russia expressed by the us congress, american intelligence agencies and the long-standing post-war policy consensus of the us and its european allies. ""he [trump] gives away the advantage that was hard won in the cold war,"" said one of the officials -- in part by ""giving putin and russia a legitimacy they never had,"" the official said. ""he's given russia a lifeline -- because there is no doubt that they're a declining power ... he's playing with something he doesn't understand and he's giving them power that they would use [aggressively].""

both officials cited trump's decision to pull us troops out of syria -- a move that benefited turkey as well as russia -- as perhaps the most grievous example. ""he gave away the store,"" one of them said.

the frequency of the calls with erdogan -- in which the turkish president continually pressed trump for policy concessions and other favors -- was especially worrisome to mcmaster, bolton and kelly, the more so because of the ease with which erdogan bypassed normal national security council protocols and procedures to reach the president, said two of the sources.

president donald trump and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan take part in a white house press conference in november 2019.

erdogan became so adept at knowing when to reach the president directly that some white house aides became convinced that turkey's security services in washington were using trump's schedule and whereabouts to provide erdogan with information about when the president would be available for a call.

on some occasions erdogan reached him on the golf course and trump would delay play while the two spoke at length.

two sources described the president as woefully uninformed about the history of the syrian conflict and the middle east generally, and said he was often caught off guard, and lacked sufficient knowledge to engage on equal terms in nuanced policy discussion with erdogan. ""erdogan took him to the cleaners,"" said one of the sources.

the sources said that deleterious us policy decisions on syria -- including the president's directive to pull us forces out of the country, which then allowed turkey to attack kurds who had helped the us fight isis and weakened nato's role in the conflict -- were directly linked to erdogan's ability to get his way with trump on the phone calls.

trump occasionally became angry at erdogan -- sometimes because of demands that turkey be granted preferential trade status, and because the turkish leader would not release an imprisoned american evangelical pastor, andrew brunson, accused of 'aiding terrorism' in the 2016 coup that attempted to overthrow erdogan. brunson was eventually released in october 2018.

despite the lack of advance notice for many of erdogan's calls, full sets of contemporaneous notes from designated notetakers at the white house exist, as well as rough voice-generated computer texts of the conversations, the sources said.

according to one high-level source, there are also existing summaries and conversation-readouts of the president's discussions with erdogan that might reinforce bolton's allegations against trump in the so-called ""halkbank case,"" involving a major turkish bank with suspected ties to erdogan and his family. that source said the matter was raised in more than one telephone conversation between erdogan and trump.

bolton wrote in his book that in december 2018, at erdogan's urging, trump offered to interfere in an investigation by then-us attorney for the southern district of new york geoffrey berman into the turkish bank, which was accused of violating us sanctions on iran.

""trump then told erdogan he would take care of things, explaining that the southern district prosecutors were not his people, but were obama people, a problem that would be fixed when they were replaced by his people,"" bolton wrote. berman's office eventually brought an indictment against the bank in october 2019 for fraud, money laundering and other offenses related to participation in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade the us sanctions on iran. on june 20, trump fired berman -- whose office is also investigating rudy giuliani, the president's personal lawyer -- after the prosecutor refused to resign at attorney general william barr's direction.

unlike bolton, cnn's sources did not assert or suggest specifically that trump's calls with erdogan might have been grounds for impeachment because of possible evidence of unlawful conduct by the president. rather, they characterized trump's calls with heads of state in the aggregate as evidence of trump's general ""unfitness"" for the presidency on grounds of temperament and incompetence, an assertion bolton made as well in an interview to promote his book with abc news last week: ""i don't think he's fit for office. i don't think he has the competence to carry out the job,"" bolton said.

family feedback and grievances fuel trump's approach

cnn spoke to sources familiar with the president's phone calls repeatedly over a four-month period. in their interviews, the sources took great care not to disclose specific national security information and classified details -- but rather described the broad contents of many of the calls, and the overall tenor and methodology of trump's approach to his telephone discussions with foreign leaders.

in addition to rough, voice-generated software transcription, almost all of trump's telephone conversations with putin, erdogan and leaders of the western alliance were supplemented and documented by extensive contemporaneous note-taking (and, often, summaries) prepared by fiona hill, deputy assistant to the president and senior nsc director for europe and russia until her resignation last year. hill listened to most of the president's calls with putin, erdogan and the european leaders, according to her closed-door testimony before the house intelligence committee last november.

elements of that testimony by hill, if re-examined by congressional investigators, might provide a detailed road-map of the president's extensively-documented conversations, the sources said. white house and intelligence officials familiar with the voice-generated transcriptions and underlying documents agreed that their contents could be devastating to the president's standing with members of the congress of both parties -- and the public -- if revealed in great detail. (there is little doubt that trump would invoke executive privilege to keep the conversations private. however, some former officials with detailed knowledge of many of the conversations might be willing to testify about them, sources said.)

in one of the earliest calls between putin and trump, the president's son-in-law jared kushner and ivanka trump were in the room to listen — joining mcmaster, tillerson, hill, and a state department aide to tillerson.

""the call was all over the place,"" said an nsc deputy who read a detailed summary of the conversation -- with putin speaking substantively and at length, and trump propping himself up in short autobiographical bursts of bragging, self-congratulation and flattery toward putin. as described to cnn, kushner and ivanka trump were immediately effusive in their praise of how trump had handled the call -- while tillerson (who knew putin well from his years in russia as an oil executive), hill and mcmaster were skeptical.

hill — author of a definitive biography of putin -- started to explain some of the nuances she perceived from the call, according to cnn's sources — offering insight into putin's psychology, his typical ""smooth-talking"" and linear approach and what the russian leader was trying to achieve in the call. hill was cut off by trump, and the president continued discussing the call with jared and ivanka, making clear he wanted to hear the congratulatory evaluation of his daughter and her husband, rather than how hill, tillerson or mcmaster judged the conversation.

mcmaster viewed that early phone call with putin as indicative of the conduct of the whole relationship between russia and the trump administration, according to the sources -- a conclusion subsequent national security advisers and chiefs of staff, and numerous high-ranking intelligence officials also reached: unlike in previous administrations, there were relatively few meaningful dealings between military and diplomatic professionals, even at the highest levels, because trump -- distrustful of the experts and dismissive of their attempts to brief him -- conducted the relationship largely ad hoc with putin and almost totally by himself. ultimately, putin and the russians learned that ""nobody has the authority to do anything"" -- and the russian leader used that insight to his advantage, as one of cnn's sources said.

the kushners were also present for other important calls with foreign leaders and made their primacy apparent, encouraged by the president even on matters of foreign policy in which his daughter and her husband had no experience. almost never, according to cnn's sources, would trump read the briefing materials prepared for him by the cia and nsc staff in advance of his calls with heads of state.

""he won't consult them, he won't even get their wisdom,"" said one of the sources, who cited saudi arabia's bin salman as near the top of a list of leaders whom trump ""picks up and calls without anybody being prepared,"" a scenario that frequently confronted nsc and intelligence aides. the source added that the aides' helpless reaction ""would frequently be, 'oh my god, don't make that phone call.'""

""trump's view is that he is a better judge of character than anyone else,"" said one of cnn's sources. the president consistently rejected advice from us defense, intelligence and national security principals that the russian president be approached more firmly and with less trust. cnn's sources pointed to the most notable public example as ""emblematic"": trump, standing next to the russian president at their meeting in helsinki, finland, in june 2018, and saying he ""didn't see any reason why"" russia would have interfered in the 2016 presidential election -- despite the findings of the entire us intelligence community that moscow had. ""president putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,"" trump said.

the common, overwhelming dynamic that characterizes trump's conversations with both authoritarian dictators and leaders of the world's greatest democracies is his consistent assertion of himself as the defining subject and subtext of the calls -- almost never the united states and its historic place and leadership in the world, according to sources intimately familiar with the calls.

in numerous calls with the leaders of the uk, france, germany, australia and canada -- america's closest allies of the past 75 years, the whole postwar era -- trump typically established a grievance almost as a default or leitmotif of the conversation, whatever the supposed agenda, according to those sources.

""everything was always personalized, with everybody doing terrible things to rip us off — which meant ripping 'me' — trump — off. he couldn't -- or wouldn't -- see or focus on the larger picture,"" said one us official.

the source cited a conspicuously demonstrable instance in which trump resisted asking angela merkel (at the uk's urging) to publicly hold russia accountable for the so-called 'salisbury' poisonings of a former russian spy and his daughter with novichok, a nerve agent developed in what was then the soviet union, in which putin had denied any russian involvement despite voluminous evidence to the contrary.

""it took a lot of effort"" to get trump to bring up the subject, said one source. instead of addressing russia's responsibility for the poisonings and holding it to international account, trump made the focus of the call -- in personally demeaning terms -- germany's and merkel's supposedly deadbeat approach to allied burden-sharing. eventually, said the sources, as urged by his nsc staff, trump at last addressed the matter of the poisonings, almost grudgingly.

""with almost every problem, all it takes [in his phone calls] is someone asking him to do something as president on behalf of the united states and he doesn't see it that way; he goes to being ripped off; he's not interested in cooperative issues or working on them together; instead he's deflecting things or pushing real issues off into a corner,"" said a us official.

""there was no sense of 'team america' in the conversations,"" or of the united states as an historic force with certain democratic principles and leadership of the free world, said the official. ""the opposite. it was like the united states had disappeared. it was always 'just me'.""

updated 11:45 p.m. et monday

in a tweet late sunday night, president trump said the intelligence community told him he was not briefed about allegations that russia had offered the taliban bounty payments to kill western forces — including u.s. troops — because it did not find the reports credible.

""intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @vp. possibly another fabricated russia hoax, maybe by the fake news @nytimesbooks, wanting to make republicans look bad!!!"" the president tweeted.

the tweet reaffirmed an earlier denial by the president of a new york times report that intelligence officials had briefed him on the allegations of malign russian activity in afghanistan.

the pentagon ""has no corroborating evidence to validate the recent allegations,"" according to a statement by spokesman jonathan hoffman, who says the defense department continues to evaluate intelligence and takes steps to protect the safety and security of u.s. forces.

cia director gina haspel made a rare public comment, saying in a statement, ""hostile states' use of proxies in war zones to inflict damage on u.s. interests and troops is a constant, longstanding concern. cia will continue to pursue every lead; analyze the information we collect with critical, objective eyes; and brief reliable intelligence to protect u.s. forces deployed around the world.""

she also said such information is shared throughout the national intelligence community and leaks ""compromise critical interagency work.""

a similar statement was released by director of national intelligence john ratcliffe, who said intelligence agencies are still investigating russia's possible activity.

""this is the analytic process working the way it should,"" ratcliffe said. ""unfortunately, unauthorized disclosures now jeopardize our ability to ever find out the full story with respect to these allegations.""

the washington post reported sunday night that the bounties are ""believed to have resulted in the deaths of several u.s. service members,"" a conclusion based on interviews with captured militants.

earlier sunday, rep. liz cheney, r-wyo., the third-ranking house republican, called on the white house to tell congress who in the administration knew of the intelligence and when.

""what has been done in response to protect our forces & hold putin accountable?"" she tweeted.

citing unnamed officials, the times report, published friday, details how u.s. intelligence officials reached the conclusion about the secret payments and then briefed the president in march. the white house national security council convened an interagency meeting that same month to discuss the matter, according to the report. the finding was also included in the president's daily brief, according to the times.

trump denied the report in a series of tweets on sunday, saying he was never briefed on the intelligence assessment.

""nobody briefed or told me, @vp pence, or chief of staff @markmeadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in afghanistan by russians, as reported through an 'anonymous source' by the fake news @nytimes. everybody is denying it & there have not been many attacks on us.....,"" trump said.

the president followed up the denial by saying, ""nobody's been tougher on russia than the trump administration."" he went on to criticize former president barack obama, the times, presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden and his son, hunter.

""with corrupt joe biden & obama, russia had a field day, taking over important parts of ukraine - where's hunter? probably just another phony times hit job, just like their failed russia hoax. who is their 'source'?"" trump tweeted.

the white house denied on saturday that the president had been briefed on the matter, but as the times notes, press secretary kayleigh mcenany did not push back on the substance of the intelligence assessment.

a statement saturday by john ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, also denied that the president was briefed on the issue but also did not refute that russia had offered bounties in exchange for attacks on u.s. forces.

the times, in its reporting, does not specify how many troops may have been killed by insurgents seeking monetary reward but does say officials were confident that russian operatives offered and paid bounties to militants for killing americans. in a separate report by cnn, an unnamed european intelligence official said russia also offered bounties for the killing of soldiers from the united kingdom.

according to the times, u.s. officials have concluded that the bounty operation was orchestrated by the gru — russian military intelligence — which has also been linked to assassination attempts and other cloak-and-dagger operations, including the 2018 nerve agent poisoning of a former russian spy in salisbury, england.

the gru is the same unit that u.s. intelligence has implicated in efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election. the investigation into russian meddling in the election, led by former special counsel robert mueller, indicted 12 russian nationals it identified as active-duty members of the gru.

the russian embassy in washington denied the times report in a tweet on saturday, calling the report ""fake news."" a spokesman for the taliban told the newspaper that the report was ""baseless.""

critics of trump called the reporting further evidence that the president has failed to adequately curb the influence of russia and has instead sought to foster a cozy relationship with russian president vladimir putin.

speaking from a virtual town hall on saturday, biden, the former u.s. vice president, said that if the story was correct, then it was a betrayal to u.s. forces to fail to protect them in a war zone.

""not only has he failed to sanction or impose any kind of consequences on russia for this egregious violation of international law — donald trump has continued his embarrassing campaign of deference and debasing himself before vladimir putin,"" biden said.

in another tweet sunday, trump responded by calling his likely 2020 opponent corrupt and his comments on the times story ""obviously written by his handlers."""
U.S. Pediatricians Call For In-Person School This Fall,27,hic40i,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/29/884638999/u-s-pediatricians-call-for-in-person-school-this-fall,5,1593504316.0,,"u.s. pediatricians call for in-person school this fall

the nation's pediatricians have come out with a strong statement in favor of bringing children back to the classroom this fall wherever and whenever they can do so safely. the american academy of pediatrics' guidance ""strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.""

the guidance says ""schools are fundamental to child and adolescent development and well-being.""

the aap cites ""mounting evidence"" that transmission of the coronavirus by young children is uncommon, partly because they are less likely to contract it in the first place.

on the other hand, the aap argues that based on the nation's experience this spring, remote learning is likely to result in severe learning loss and increased social isolation. social isolation, in turn, can breed serious social, emotional and health issues: ""child and adolescent physical or sexual abuse, substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation."" furthermore, these impacts will be visited more severely on black and brown children, as well as low-income children and those with learning disabilities.

the guidance for returning to in-person schooling includes recommendations about physical distancing, cleaning and disinfection, hand-washing, and using outdoor spaces whenever possible.

the aap argues that offering elementary school children the opportunity to go to school every day should be given due consideration over spacing guidelines if capacity is an issue: ""schools should weigh the benefits of strict adherence to a 6-feet spacing rule between students with the potential downside if remote learning is the only alternative.""

and, it also argues that masks are probably not practical for children younger than middle school unless they can wear a mask without increased face touching.

the guidelines do note that adult school staff are more at risk compared to young children and need to be able to distance from other adults as much as possible — no in-person faculty meetings, no class visits by parents. and they emphasize the need to make accommodations for students who are medically fragile or have special health care needs or disabilities.

however, these guidelines don't necessarily address the health concerns of america's teachers or their willingness to return to in-person teaching. federal data show nearly a third of teachers are over 50, putting them in a higher risk category when it comes to the disease.

fairfax county public schools in virginia, for example, recently announced its reopening plans, offering families a choice between two days a week of in-person classes or an all-remote schedule plus extra intervention on a third day for students who need it. the county's three educator unions resisted, arguing in a statement that remote learning should continue. ""our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools,"" said tina williams, president of fairfax county federation of teachers. ""they fear for their lives, the lives of their students and the lives of their families."""

(ap photo/rahmat gul, file)

top officials in the white house were aware in early 2019 of classified intelligence indicating russia was secretly offering bounties to the taliban for the deaths of americans, a full year earlier than has been previously reported, according to u.s. officials with direct knowledge of the intelligence.

the assessment was included in at least one of president donald trump’s written daily intelligence briefings at the time, according to the officials. then-national security adviser john bolton also told colleagues he briefed trump on the intelligence assessment in march 2019.

the white house did not respond to questions about trump or other officials’ awareness of russia’s provocations in 2019. the white house has said trump was not — and still has not been — briefed on the intelligence assessments because they have not been fully verified. however, it is rare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of a doubt before it is presented to top officials.

bolton declined to comment monday when asked by the ap if he had briefed trump about the matter in 2019. on sunday, he suggested to nbc’s “meet the press” that trump was claiming ignorance of russia’s provocations to justify his administration’s lack of a response.

“he can disown everything if nobody ever told him about it,” bolton said.

the revelations cast new doubt on the white house’s efforts to distance trump from the russian intelligence assessments. the ap reported sunday that concerns about russian bounties were also included in a second written presidential daily briefing earlier this year and that current national security adviser robert o’brien had discussed the matter with trump. o’brien denies he did so.

on monday night, o’brien said that while the intelligence assessments regarding russian bounties “have not been verified,” the administration has “been preparing should the situation warrant action.”

the administration’s earlier awareness of the russian efforts raises additional questions about why trump did not take any punitive action against moscow for efforts that put the lives of americans servicemembers at risk. trump has sought throughout his time in office to improve relations with russia and its president, vladimir putin, moving earlier this year to try to reinstate russia as part of a group of world leaders it had been kicked out of.

officials said they did not consider the intelligence assessments in 2019 to be particularly urgent, given that russian meddling in afghanistan is not a new occurrence. the officials with knowledge of bolton’s apparent briefing for trump said it contained no “actionable intelligence,” meaning the intelligence community did not have enough information to form a strategic plan or response. however, the classified assessment of russian bounties was the sole purpose of the meeting.

the officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the highly sensitive information.

the intelligence that surfaced in early 2019 indicated russian operatives had become more aggressive in their desire to contract with the taliban and members of the haqqani network, a militant group aligned with the taliban in afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012 during the obama administration.

the national security council and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence did hold meetings regarding the intelligence. the pentagon declined to comment and the nsc did not respond to questions about the meetings.

concerns about russian bounties flared anew this year after members of the elite naval special warfare development group, known to the public as seal team six, raided a taliban outpost and recovered roughly $500,000 in u.s. currency. the funds bolstered the suspicions of the american intelligence community that the russians had offered money to taliban militants and other linked associations.

the white house contends the president was unaware of this development as well.

the officials told the ap that career government officials developed potential options for the white house to respond to the russian aggression in afghanistan, which was first reported by the new york times. however, the trump administration has yet to authorize any action.

the intelligence in 2019 and 2020 surrounding russian bounties was derived in part from debriefings of captured taliban militants. officials with knowledge of the matter told the ap that taliban operatives from opposite ends of the country and from separate tribes offered similar accounts.

the officials would not name the specific groups or give specific locations in afghanistan or time frames for when they were detained.

dmitry peskov, a spokesman for putin, denied that russian intelligence officers had offered payments to the taliban in exchange for targeting u.s. and coalition forces.

the u.s. is investigating whether any americans died as a result of the russian bounties. officials are focused in particular on an april 2019 attack on an american convoy. three u.s. marines were killed after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they returned to bagram airfield, the largest u.s. military installation in afghanistan.

the marines exchanged gunfire with the vehicle at some point; however, it’s not known if the gunfire occurred before or after the car exploded.

abdul raqib kohistani, the bagram district police chief, said at the time that at least five afghan civilians were wounded after the attack on the convoy, according to previous reporting by the ap. it is not known if the civilians were injured by the car bomb or the gunfire from u.s. marines.

the defense department identified marine staff sgt. christopher slutman, 43, of newark, delaware; sgt. benjamin hines, 31, of york, pennsylvania; and cpl. robert hendriks, 25, of locust valley, new york, as the marines killed in april 2019. the three marines were all infantrymen assigned to 2nd battalion, 25th marines, a reserve infantry unit headquartered out of garden city, new york.

hendriks’ father told the ap that even a rumor of russian bounties should have been immediately addressed.

“if this was kind of swept under the carpet as to not make it a bigger issue with russia, and one ounce of blood was spilled when they knew this, i lost all respect for this administration and everything,” erik hendriks said.

marine maj. roger hollenbeck said at the time that the reserve unit was a part of the georgia deployment program-resolute support mission, a recurring six-month rotation between u.s. marines and georgian armed forces. the unit first deployed to afghanistan in october 2018.

three other service members and an afghan contractor were also wounded in the attack. as of april 2019, the attack was under a separate investigation, unrelated to the russian bounties, to determine how it unfolded.

the officials who spoke to the ap also said they were looking closely at insider attacks — sometimes called “green-on-blue” incidents — from 2019 to determine if they are also linked to russian bounties.

Supreme Court: Montana Can't Exclude Religious Schools From Scholarship Program,212,hioh3o,https://www.npr.org/2020/06/30/883074890/supreme-court-montana-cant-exclude-religious-schools-from-scholarship-program,14,1593556422.0,,"supreme court: montana can't exclude religious schools from scholarship program

updated at 5:53 p.m. et

in a major victory for what advocates call the school choice movement, the u.s. supreme court effectively killed state constitutional provisions in as many as 38 states that bar taxpayer aid to parochial schools. the vote was 5-4, with chief justice john roberts writing the decision for the court's conservative justices.

the court's decision is the latest in a series of recent rulings that have lowered the traditional wall separating church and state by requiring government entities to treat religious and nonreligious institutions more equally, even when that means sending public money to religious institutions.

tuesday's case began in 2015 when the montana legislature passed a bill providing a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for individuals who donate to organizations that provide scholarship money to students in private schools. an organization called big sky began raising money to fund these scholarships, using the tax credit as an incentive. of the 13 schools that got scholarship money from big sky, 12 were religious schools. indeed, 70% of all private schools in montana are religiously affiliated.

ultimately, the montana supreme court struck down the entire tax credit program for all private schools, religious and nonreligious alike. it said the tax credit conflicted with the state constitution, which bars all state aid for religious education, whether direct or indirect, including tax subsidies such as this one.

but in tuesday's opinion, roberts said the state court had it backward.

""a state need not subsidize private education, but once it decides to do so it cannot disqualify some private schools because they are religious,"" he wrote. thus the tax credit created by the montana legislature to benefit students attending qualifying private schools, including religious ones, must stand as originally designed.

in dissent, justice ruth bader ginsburg rebutted roberts' argument. she said that because the montana supreme court invalidated the program entirely, it did not discriminate against students attending religious schools at all. because the state court's ""judgment put all private school parents in the same boat—this court had no occasion to address the matter,"" ginsburg wrote.

in a separate dissent, justices stephen breyer asked: ""what are the limits of the court's holding?"" he feared that the court's logic could lead to extreme consequences in the future, perhaps even a decision requiring states to fund private religious schools even if they would rather use their money to fund public schools exclusively.

justice sonia sotomayor, also writing separately, called the decision ""perverse"" for throwing the u.s. constitution's religion clauses out of balance.

as for the conservative wing of the court, all of its members signed on to the roberts opinion, but several of them wrote separately to express their own views on the subject. justice clarence thomas reiterated his view that the constitution's ban on the establishment of religion does not apply to the states, except in cases of coercion.

justice neil gorsuch urged the court to go further to protect the free exercise of religion. while the majority said that montana had impermissibly discriminated on the basis of the schools' religious status, gorsuch said the state , discriminated on the basis of religious activity as well. as an example, he pointed to the lead plaintiff's testimony that ""she would like to use scholarship funds to enable her daughters to be taught in school the 'same christian values' they are taught at home. the court, said gorsuch, should make it clear that both types of discrimination are unconstitutional.

justice samuel alito used his concurrence to recount the troubled history of the so-called ""baby blaine amendments,"" no-aid provisions in the state constitutions of 38 states that, like the montana constitution, prohibit public funds from benefiting religious schools.

such provisions are named after james g. blaine, who proposed a similar amendment to the u.s. constitution in 1875. while the original amendment failed to pass, variations of it were adopted in most states. many scholars today view the adoption of these amendments, mostly in the late 1800s, as a bigoted reaction to the mass immigration of catholics into the u.s., a narrative that alito embraced wholeheartedly.

but many states in modern times have, by referenda, refused to abandon the no-religious aid concept. and montana's no-aid provision is no relic of the past. the state constitution was completely rewritten in 1972.

mae nan ellingson, one of the delegates to the 1972 constitutional convention, said that ultimately the convention adopted the no-aid amendment in part ""to protect religious liberty"" and that the no-aid provision was ""never even a threshold issue.""

regardless of their origins, experts on both sides of the issue agreed that the practical effect of tuesday's decision is to neuter these state constitutional provisions, which until now have limited state aid to religious schools to one degree or another.

francisco negron, chief legal officer for the national school boards association, said that these provisions are ""near death.""

and so-called ""school choice"" advocates celebrated the victory.

dick komer, a senior attorney at the institute for justice, which brought tuesday's case on behalf of several parents with children in religious schools in montana, called on state legislators to capitalize on the moment to create programs that allow state funds to benefit private religious schools.

""the legal impediments to effective school choice programs are now removed, and it's up to state legislatures now to move forward,"" komer said after the decision was announced.

publicly funded voucher and tax credit programs currently provide aid to private schools in 26 states, according to john schilling, president of one of the country's leading school choice advocacy organizations, the american federation for children.

""what we would like to see is state policymakers really step up to the plate here and expand ... school choice programs, and to enact it in the 24 states that don't have these programs,"" schilling said.

stanford law school professor michael mcconnell said he saw the decision as good for education all around.

""when you have a state where ... a significant minority of parents are using private schools, they're going to be voting against increasing taxes for public education,"" he said. ""but if they are able to share in the education pot, they may move to supporters of greater aid to education.""

until now, these aid programs, which mainly benefit private religious schools, have amounted to a relatively small $2.6 billion in aid out of more than $700 billion spent on public education each year, according to schilling. but school choice advocates, including u.s. education secretary betsy devos, have pushed hard to increase the funding for what she calls faith-based education.

if the state is going to funnel more money to private education, said negron, the national school boards association lawyer, that will likely provoke more litigation.

he said some states might look at tuesday's decision and say, ""if you're going to take state money,"" then ""you can't discriminate against students on the basis of sexual orientation."" or states may condition public funds on satisfying public health requirements, ""which means that all children have to [be] vaccinated.""

colorado attorney general phil weiser, who filed a brief on behalf of nine states in the montana case, said that funding private schools can have unexpected political consequences. he noted that when the school board in douglas county, a suburb south of denver, adopted a program that threatened to siphon public money from public schools, ""there was a huge backlash,"" and ""the school board that pushed the program got voted out as well.""

that said, tuesday's ruling was a personal victory for the parents who challenged the montana ban on aid to religious schools.

kendra espinoza, the lead plaintiff, was elated. earlier this year, the office manager explained why she worked extra jobs so that her two daughters could attend the stillwater christian school in kalispell, mont. ""at home we are a christian family and i want those values taught at school,"" she said.

among those cheering tuesday's ruling was the trump administration, which supported espinoza's case in the supreme court. at the white house, press secretary kayleigh mcenany issued a statement saying: ""the trump administration believes that school choice is a civil rights issue, and that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing school.""

andrea picciotti-bayer, legal adviser for the catholic association, called it ""a welcome victory for religious freedom and countless american families,"" adding it will give ""low-income students a chance to attend religious schools of their choice using state-endorsed private school scholarship funds.""

but lily eskelsen garcía, the head of the country's largest teachers union, called the decision ""shameful and unacceptable."" in a statement, she said: ""at a time when public schools nationwide already are grappling with protecting and providing for students despite a pandemic and mounting budget shortfalls, the court has made things even worse opening the door for further attacks on state decisions not to fund religious schools.""

though a sweeping victory for school choice advocates, the court's opinion still leaves some questions unanswered.

david strauss, a law professor at the university of chicago, observed that the two religion clauses of the first amendment are often in tension.

""we want a principle that says the government shouldn't be paying the salaries of members of the clergy,"" he said. ""but on the other hand, if a fire breaks out in a church, you don't want the fire department saying, 'oh wait a second, it's a church; we can't put out the fire.' ""

EU Sets New List Of Approved Travel Partners.

u.s. travelers won't be among those allowed to visit the european union when the bloc begins opening its external borders on july 1. eu ambassadors endorsed a list of 15 travel partners on tuesday, including south korea, japan and, with a caveat, china. those countries were hit early by the pandemic but have been able to bring the coronavirus under control.

the eu list requires reciprocal easing of travel bans — and the u.s. currently bars most travelers from european countries. china's inclusion on the travel list is predicated on its removal of eu members from its own travel restrictions.

the u.s. was seen as a long shot to make the travel list, which requires that only those countries with epidemiological situations — taking into account both the infection rate and current trends — that are equal to or better than the eu's can send tourists and other nonessential visitors to the open-border region.

when the eu began discussing its travel list earlier this month, many u.s. states were seeing a worrying spike in cases — a trend that has only worsened.

as ambassadors at the european council debated the final list, the u.s. shattered its record for daily new cases, reporting 39,972 new cases on june 26, compared with its previous mark of 36,291 cases, which was set on april 24.

the allowed countries are:

algeria

australia

canada

georgia

japan

montenegro

morocco

new zealand

rwanda

serbia

south korea

thailand

tunisia

uruguay

china (subject to confirmation of reciprocity)

it's up to each eu member state to decide how to implement the list — but the european council says none of them should unilaterally lift travel restrictions on a ""non-listed"" country.

now that the eu travel list has been released, the bloc plans to revise it on a regular basis, as frequently as every two weeks. for now, the u.s. is excluded along with other countries that are struggling to fight the coronavirus, such as brazil and russia.

the eu has roughly 116 million more people than the u.s. but the bloc is currently reporting roughly 1.5 million coronavirus cases — far less than the more than 2.6 million cases reported by the u.s.

and in a troubling sign of how deeply the coronavirus has taken root in the u.s., the head of the centers for disease control and prevention has said that the official tally is vastly undercounted, with more than 20 million americans possibly infected.

""our best estimate right now is that for every case that was reported, there actually were 10 other infections,"" cdc director dr. robert redfield said last week.

as it issued the travel list, the eu also provided more clarity about how it analyzes other countries' coronavirus status. in addition to looking at the number of new cases over the past 14 days, for instance, the european standard calls for a country's case rate per 100,000 inhabitants to be ""close to or below the eu average.""

when u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo was asked about the possible exclusion of the u.s. last week, he said discussions are ongoing.

""i am confident that we will find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protections"" and still allow travel, pompeo said at a press briefing.

if no u.s. tourists visit europe in the coming months, it would deal another financial blow to an already ailing travel and hospitality industry. last year, roughly 2 million or more americans visited europe in each month from may through september, according to the u.s. national travel & tourism office.

the pandemic has turned travel into a fraught topic, over fears of the possible spread of the virus. it has also caused tension between the eu and the u.s., particularly after president trump announced a travel ban on 26 european countries (exempting the united kingdom) in mid-march. eu officials publicly registered their disapproval, saying they had not been warned about the ban. days later, the eu began closing its own borders.

McGrath wins Kentucky Senate primary,79,hirg3c,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/30/kentucky-results-345354,12,1593565688.0,,"booker’s rise began late last month as he took part in protests against police brutality in his hometown of louisville. major leaders from the party’s left wing, from sens. bernie sanders and elizabeth warren to rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, endorsed him in the closing weeks. he already had support from state legislators and other kentucky democrats, but more in-state supporters jumped off the sidelines down the stretch.

but mcgrath, a former marine fighter pilot who was backed by the democratic senatorial campaign committee, had a superior organization and massive fundraising advantage that proved too much to overcome. she raised more than $40 million ahead of the primary, significantly outraising booker and even mcconnell. she spent more than $12 million on tv in the race, compared to less than $2 million from booker, and her campaign won significant margins in the state’s rural counties outside louisville and lexington.

most of her spending focused on mcconnell, as mcgrath essentially ran a general-election campaign against him for months, even after booker joined the race in january. she focused some of her late advertising more directly to the state’s democrats, a concession to the rapidly tightening race, and outspent booker heavily in the final week. even then, her advertising leaned on many democrats’ belief that her campaign is best suited to challenge mcconnell this fall.

""i'm humbled that kentucky democrats have nominated me to take on mitch mcconnell in the general election and can't wait to get started in sending him into retirement and finally draining the toxic washington political swamp that he built,"" mcgrath said in a statement tuesday.

she also praised booker for his campaign, saying there was no doubt he ""tapped into and amplified the energy and anger of so many who are fed-up with the status quo and are rightfully demanding long overdue action and accountability from our government and institutions."" mcgrath called for the party to unify in the effort to defeat mcconnell, and promised a dialogue with those voters who didn't support her.

booker conceded the race in a lengthy statement tuesday evening — and though he didn't explicitly endorse mcgrath, he called on his supporters to dedicate themselves to beating mcconnell. he also said there were still positives to take away from his campaign.

“we went from being down 50 points in the polls to falling just short of a tie. while i’m disappointed, i’m so proud of us, and i’m still hopeful,"" booker said. ""hundreds of thousands of kentuckians left behind by mitch mcconnell came together to demand a better future and a better government.""

kate cooksey, a spokeswoman for mcconnell's campaign, welcomed mcgrath to the general election by calling her extreme, and saying she is ""lucky to have gotten out of the primary with a victory, but her reputation sustained significant damage all across kentucky.""

kentucky is a challenging state for democrats to compete in a federal general election. mcconnell, who is seeking a sixth term, is unpopular in polling of his state’s voters, and some public surveys have shown the race to be competitive. but president donald trump is favored to carry the state overwhelmingly in the fall, and democrats would need to convince huge numbers of voters to split their tickets.

still, it is the first time mcconnell will be on the ballot since becoming majority leader, and mcgrath’s fundraising ability gives democrats hope of making the contest expensive and potentially competitive. a super pac aligned with mcconnell has already booked nearly $11 million in ads to run this fall, an investment that came alongside more likely battleground states like arizona, north carolina and maine."

marquita johnson, who was locked up in april 2012, says the impact of her time in jail endures today. johnson’s three children were cast into foster care while she was incarcerated. one daughter was molested, state records show. another was physically abused.

“judge hayes took away my life and didn’t care how my children suffered,” said johnson, now 36. “my girls will never be the same.”

fellow inmates found her sentence hard to believe. “they had a nickname for me: the woman with all the days,” johnson said. “that’s what they called me: the woman with all the days. there were people who had committed real crimes who got out before me.”

in 2016, the state agency that oversees judges charged hayes with violating alabama’s code of judicial conduct. according to the judicial inquiry commission, hayes broke state and federal laws by jailing johnson and hundreds of other montgomery residents too poor to pay fines. among those jailed: a plumber struggling to make rent, a mother who skipped meals to cover the medical bills of her disabled son, and a hotel housekeeper working her way through college.

hayes, a judge since 2000, admitted in court documents to violating 10 different parts of the state’s judicial conduct code. one of the counts was a breach of a judge’s most essential duty: failing to “respect and comply with the law.”

despite the severity of the ruling, hayes wasn’t barred from serving as a judge. instead, the judicial commission and hayes reached a deal. the former eagle scout would serve an 11-month unpaid suspension. then he could return to the bench.

until he was disciplined, hayes said in an interview with reuters, “i never thought i was doing something wrong.”

this week, hayes is set to retire after 20 years as a judge. in a statement to reuters, hayes said he was “very remorseful” for his misdeeds.

community activists say his departure is long overdue. yet the decision to leave, they say, should never have been his to make, given his record of misconduct.

“he should have been fired years ago,” said willie knight, pastor of north montgomery baptist church. “he broke the law and wanted to get away with it. his sudden retirement is years too late.”

hayes is among thousands of state and local judges across america who were allowed to keep positions of extraordinary power and prestige after violating judicial ethics rules or breaking laws they pledged to uphold, a reuters investigation found.

judges have made racist statements, lied to state officials and forced defendants to languish in jail without a lawyer – and then returned to the bench, sometimes with little more than a rebuke from the state agencies overseeing their conduct.

recent media reports have documented failures in judicial oversight in south carolina, louisiana and illinois. reuters went further.

in the first comprehensive accounting of judicial misconduct nationally, reuters reviewed 1,509 cases from the last dozen years – 2008 through 2019 – in which judges resigned, retired or were publicly disciplined following accusations of misconduct. in addition, reporters identified another 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined wayward judges but kept hidden from the public key details of their offenses – including the identities of the judges themselves.

all told, 9 of every 10 judges were allowed to return to the bench after they were sanctioned for misconduct, reuters determined. they included a california judge who had sex in his courthouse chambers, once with his former law intern and separately with an attorney; a new york judge who berated domestic violence victims; and a maryland judge who, after his arrest for driving drunk, was allowed to return to the bench provided he took a breathalyzer test before each appearance.

the news agency’s findings reveal an “excessively” forgiving judicial disciplinary system, said stephen gillers, a law professor at new york university who writes about judicial ethics. although punishment short of removal from the bench is appropriate for most misconduct cases, gillers said, the public “would be appalled at some of the lenient treatment judges get” for substantial transgressions.

among the cases from the past year alone:

in utah, a judge texted a video of a man’s scrotum to court clerks. he was reprimanded but remains on the bench.

in indiana, three judges attending a conference last spring got drunk and sparked a 3 a.m. brawl outside a white castle fast-food restaurant that ended with two of the judges shot. although the state supreme court found the three judges had “discredited the entire indiana judiciary,” each returned to the bench after a suspension.

in texas, a judge burst in on jurors deliberating the case of a woman charged with sex trafficking and declared that god told him the defendant was innocent. the offending judge received a warning and returned to the bench. the defendant was convicted after a new judge took over the case.

“there are certain things where there should be a level of zero tolerance,” the jury foreman, mark house, told reuters. the judge should have been fined, house said, and kicked off the bench. “there is no justice, because he is still doing his job.”

judicial misconduct specialists say such behavior has the potential to erode trust in america’s courts and, absent tough consequences, could give judges license to behave with impunity.

“when you see cases like that, the public starts to wonder about the integrity and honesty of the system,” said steve scheckman, a lawyer who directed louisiana’s oversight agency and served as deputy director of new york’s. “it looks like a good ol’ boys club.”

that’s how local lawyers viewed the case of a longtime alabama judge who concurrently served on the state’s judicial oversight commission. the judge, cullman district court’s kim chaney, remained on the bench for three years after being accused of violating the same nepotism rules he was tasked with enforcing on the oversight commission. in at least 200 cases, court records show, judge chaney chose his own son to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer for the indigent, enabling the younger chaney to earn at least $105,000 in fees over two years.

in february, months after reuters repeatedly asked chaney and the state judicial commission about those cases, he retired from the bench as part of a deal with state authorities to end the investigation.

tommy drake, the lawyer who first filed a complaint against chaney in 2016, said he doubts the judge would have been forced from the bench if reuters hadn’t examined the case.

“you know the only reason they did anything about chaney is because you guys started asking questions,” drake said. “otherwise, he’d still be there.”

bedrock of american justice

state and local judges draw little scrutiny even though their courtrooms are the bedrock of the american criminal justice system, touching the lives of millions of people every year.

the country’s approximately 1,700 federal judges hear 400,000 cases annually. the nearly 30,000 state, county and municipal court judges handle a far bigger docket: more than 100 million new cases each year, from traffic to divorce to murder. their titles range from justice of the peace to state supreme court justice. their powers are vast and varied – from determining whether a defendant should be jailed to deciding who deserves custody of a child.

each u.s. state has an oversight agency that investigates misconduct complaints against judges. the authority of the oversight agencies is distinct from the power held by appellate courts, which can reverse a judge’s legal ruling and order a new trial. judicial commissions cannot change verdicts. rather, they can investigate complaints about the behavior of judges and pursue discipline ranging from reprimand to removal.

few experts dispute that the great majority of judges behave responsibly, respecting the law and those who appear before them. and some contend that, when judges do falter, oversight agencies are effective in identifying and addressing the behavior. “with a few notable exceptions, the commissions generally get it right,” said keith swisher, a university of arizona law professor who specializes in judicial ethics.

others disagree. they note that the clout of these commissions is limited, and their authority differs from state to state. to remove a judge, all but a handful of states require approval of a panel that includes other judges. and most states seldom exercise the full extent of those disciplinary powers.

as a result, the system tends to err on the side of protecting the rights and reputations of judges while overlooking the impact courtroom wrongdoing has on those most affected by it: people like marquita johnson.

reuters scoured thousands of state investigative files, disciplinary proceedings and court records from the past dozen years to quantify the personal toll of judicial misconduct. the examination found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge’s misconduct. the victims cited in disciplinary documents ranged from people who were illegally jailed to those subjected to racist, sexist and other abusive comments from judges in ways that tainted the cases.

the number is a conservative estimate. the tally doesn’t include two previously reported incidents that affected thousands of defendants and prompted sweeping reviews of judicial conduct.

in pennsylvania, the state examined the convictions of more than 3,500 teenagers sentenced by two judges. the judges were convicted of taking kickbacks as part of a scheme to fill a private juvenile detention center. in 2009, the pennsylvania supreme court appointed senior judge arthur grim to lead a victim review, and the state later expunged criminal records for 2,251 juveniles. grim told reuters that every state should adopt a way to compensate victims of judicial misconduct.

“if we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims, then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about,” grim said.

in another review underway in ohio, state public defender tim young is scrutinizing 2,707 cases handled by a judge who retired in 2018 after being hospitalized for alcoholism. mike benza, a law professor at case western reserve university whose students are helping identify victims, compared the work to current investigations into police abuse of power. “you see one case and then you look to see if it’s systemic,” he said.

the review, which has been limited during the coronavirus pandemic, may take a year. but young said the time-consuming task is essential because “a fundamental injustice may have been levied against hundreds or thousands of people.”

special rules for judges

most states afford judges accused of misconduct a gentle kind of justice. perhaps no state better illustrates the shortcomings of america’s system for overseeing judges than alabama.

as in most states, alabama’s nine-member judicial inquiry commission is a mix of lawyers, judges and lay people. all are appointed. their deliberations are secret and they operate under some of the most judge-friendly rules in the nation.

alabama’s rules make even filing a complaint against a judge difficult. the complaint must be notarized, which means that in theory, anyone who makes misstatements about the judge can be prosecuted for perjury. complaints about wrongdoing must be made in writing; those that arrive by phone, email or without a notary stamp are not investigated, although senders are notified why their complaints have been summarily rejected. anonymous written complaints are shredded.

these rules can leave lawyers and litigants fearing retaliation, commission director jenny garrett noted in response to written questions.

“it’s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint,” said sue bell cobb, chief justice of the alabama supreme court from 2007 to 2011. in 2009, she unsuccessfully championed changes to the process and commissioned an american bar association report that offered a scathing review of alabama’s rules.

in most other states, commission staff members can start investigating a judge upon receiving a phone call or email, even anonymous ones, or after learning of questionable conduct from a news report or court filing. in alabama, staff will not begin an investigation without approval from the commission itself, which convenes about every seven weeks.

by rule, the commission also must keep a judge who is under scrutiny fully informed throughout an investigation. if a subpoena is issued, the judge receives a simultaneous copy, raising fears about witness intimidation. if a witness gives investigators a statement, the judge receives a transcript. in the u.s. justice system, such deference to individuals under investigation is extremely rare.

“why the need for special rules for judges?” said michael levy, a washington lawyer who has represented clients in high-profile criminal, corporate, congressional and securities investigations. “if judges think it’s fair and appropriate to investigate others for crimes or misconduct without providing those subjects or targets with copies of witness statements and subpoenas, why don’t judges think it’s fair to investigate judges in the same way?”

alabama judges also are given an opportunity to resolve investigations confidentially. reuters interviews and a review of alabama commission records show the commission has met with judges informally at least 19 times since 2011 to offer corrective “guidance.” the identities of those judges remain confidential, as does the conduct that prompted the meetings. “not every violation warrants discipline,” commission director garrett said.

since 2008, the commission has brought 21 public cases against judges, including hayes, charging two this year.

two of the best-known cases brought by the commission involved roy moore, who was twice forced out as chief justice of the alabama supreme court for defying federal court orders.

another alabama justice fared better in challenging a misconduct complaint, however. tom parker, first elected to the state’s high court in 2004, pushed back when the commission investigated him in 2015 for comments he made on the radio criticizing the u.s. supreme court’s decision legalizing gay marriage.

parker sued the commission in federal court, arguing the agency was infringing on his first amendment rights. he won. although the commission had dropped its investigation before the ruling, it was ordered to cover parker’s legal fees: $100,000, or about a fifth of the agency’s total annual budget.

in 2018, the people of alabama elected parker chief justice.

these days, parker told reuters, alabama judges and the agency that oversees them enjoy “a much better relationship” that’s less politically tinged. “how can i say it? it’s much more respectful between the commission and the judges now.”

“gut instinct”

montgomery, alabama has a deep history of racial conflict, as reflected in the clashing concepts emblazoned on the city’s great seal: “cradle of the confederacy” and “birthplace of the civil rights movement.”

jefferson davis was inaugurated here as confederate president after the south seceded from the union in 1861, and his birthday is a state holiday. as was common throughout the south, the city was the site of the lynchings of black men, crimes now commemorated at a national memorial based here. police arrested civil rights icon rosa parks here in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger.

today, about 60% of montgomery’s 198,000 residents are black, u.s. census records show. even so, black motorists account for about 90% of those charged with unpaid traffic tickets, a reuters examination of court records found. much of judge hayes’ work in municipal court involved traffic cases and the collection of fines. hayes, who is white, told reuters that “the majority of people who come before the court are black.”

city officials have said that neither race nor economics have played a role in police efforts to enforce outstanding warrants, no matter how minor the offense.

in april 2012, marquita johnson was among them. appearing before hayes on a wednesday morning, the 28-year-old single mother pleaded for a break.

johnson had struggled for eight years to pay dozens of tickets that began with a citation for failing to show proof of insurance. she had insurance, she said. but when she was pulled over, she couldn’t find the card to prove it.

even a single ticket was a knockout blow on her minimum-wage waitress salary. in addition to fines, the court assessed a $155 fee to every ticket. court records show that police often issued her multiple tickets for other infractions during every stop – a practice some residents call “stacking.”

under state law, failing to pay even one ticket can result in the suspension of a driver’s license. johnson’s decision to keep driving nonetheless – taking her children to school or to doctor visits, getting groceries, going to work – led to more tickets and deeper debt.

“i told judge hayes that i had lost my job and needed more time to pay,” she recounted.

by hayes’ calculation, johnson owed more than $12,000 in fines. he sentenced johnson to 496 days in jail. hayes arrived at that sentence by counting each day in jail as $25 toward the outstanding debt. a different judge later determined that johnson actually owed half the amount calculated by hayes, and that hayes had incorrectly penalized her over fines she had already paid. to shave time off her sentence, johnson washed police cars and performed other menial labor while jailed.

hayes told reuters that he generally found pleas of poverty hard to believe. “with my years of experience, i can tell when someone is being truthful with me,” hayes said. he called it “gut instinct” - though he added, in a statement this week, that he also consulted “each defendant’s criminal and traffic history as well as their history of warrants and failures to appear in court.”

of course, the law demands more of a judge than a gut call. in a 1983 landmark decision, bearden v. georgia, the u.s. supreme court ruled that state judges are obligated to hold a hearing to determine whether a defendant has “willfully” chosen not to pay a fine.

according to the state’s judicial oversight commission, “judge hayes did not make any inquiry into ms. johnson’s ability to pay, whether her non-payment was willful.”

from jail, “i prayed to return to my daughters,” johnson said. “i was sure that someone would realize that hayes had made a mistake.”

she said her worst day in jail was her youngest daughter’s 3rd birthday. from a jail telephone, she tried to sing “happy birthday” but slumped to the floor in grief.

“she was choking up and crying,” said johnson’s mother, blanche, who was on the call. “she was devastated to be away from her children so long.”

when johnson was freed after 10 months in jail, she learned that strangers had abused her two older children. one is now a teenager; the other is in middle school.

“my kids will pay a lifetime for what the court system did to me,” johnson said. “my daughters get frantic when i leave the house. i know they’ve had nightmares that i’m going to disappear again.”

six months after johnson’s release, hayes jailed another single black mother. angela mccullough, then 40, had been pulled over driving home from faulkner university, a local community college where she carried a 3.87 grade point average. as a mother of four children, including a disabled adult son, she had returned to college to pursue her dream of becoming a mental health counselor.

police ticketed her for failing to turn on her headlights. after a background check, the officer arrested mccullough on a warrant for outstanding traffic tickets. she was later brought before hayes.

“i can’t go to jail,” mccullough recalled pleading with the judge. “i’m a mother. i have a disabled son who needs me.”

hayes sentenced mccullough to 100 days in jail to pay off a court debt of $1,350, court records show. her adult son, diagnosed with schizophrenia, was held in an institution until her release.

mccullough said she cleaned jail cells in return for time off her sentence. one day, she recalled, she had to clean a blood-soaked cell where a female inmate had slit her wrists.

she was freed after 20 days, using the money she saved for tuition to pay off her tickets, she said.

jail was the darkest chapter of her life, mccullough said, a place where “the devil was trying to take my mind.” today, she has abandoned her pursuit of a degree. “i don’t think i’ll ever be able to afford to go back.”

a clear sign that something was amiss in montgomery courts came in november 2013, when a federal lawsuit was filed alleging that city judges were unlawfully jailing the poor. a similar suit was filed in 2014, and two more civil rights cases were filed in 2015. johnson and mccullough were plaintiffs.

the lawsuits detailed practices similar to those that helped fuel protests in ferguson, missouri, after a white police officer killed a black teenager in 2014. in a scathing report on the origins of the unrest, the u.s. department of justice exposed how ferguson had systematically used traffic enforcement to raise revenue through excessive fines, a practice that fell disproportionately hard on black residents.

“montgomery is just like ferguson,” said karen jones, a community activist and founder of a local educational nonprofit. jones has led recent protests in montgomery in the wake of the killing of george floyd, the black man whose death under the knee of a cop in minneapolis set off worldwide calls for racial justice.

in montgomery, “everybody knew that the police targeted black residents. and i sat in hayes’ court and watched him squeeze poor people for more money, then toss them in jail where they had to work off debts with free labor to the city.”

it was years before the flurry of civil rights lawsuits against hayes and his fellow judges had much impact on the commission. the oversight agency opened its hayes case in summer 2015, nearly two years after plaintiffs’ lawyers in the civil rights cases filed a complaint with the body. hayes spent another year and a half on the bench before accepting the suspension.

under its own rules, the commission could have filed a complaint and told its staff to investigate hayes at any time. commission director garrett said she is prohibited by law from explaining why the commission didn’t investigate sooner. the investigation went slowly, garrett said, because it involved reviewing thousands of pages of court records. the commission also was busy with other cases from 2015 to early 2017, garrett said, issuing charges against five judges, including moore.

“slap in the face”

a few months after judge hayes’ suspension ended, his term as a municipal judge was set to expire. so, the montgomery city council took up the question of the judge’s future on march 6, 2018. on the agenda of its meeting: whether to reappoint hayes to another four-year term.

hayes wasn’t in the audience that night, but powerful supporters were. the city’s chief judge, milton westry, told the council that hayes and his colleagues have changed how they handled cases involving indigent defendants, “since we learned a better way of doing things.” in the wake of the suits, westry said, hayes and his peers complied with reforms that required judges to make audio recordings of court hearings and notify lawyers when clients are jailed for failing to pay fines.

as part of a settlement in the civil case, the city judges agreed to implement changes for at least two years. those reforms have since been abandoned, reuters found. both measures were deemed too expensive, hayes and city officials confirmed.

residents who addressed the council were incredulous that the city would consider reappointing hayes. jones, the community activist, reminded council members that hayes had “pleaded guilty to violating the very laws he was sworn to uphold.”

the city council voted to rehire hayes to a fifth consecutive term.

marquita johnson said she can’t understand why a judge whose unlawful rulings changed the lives of hundreds has himself emerged virtually unscathed.

“hiring hayes back to the bench was a slap in the face to everyone,” johnson said. “it was a message that we don’t matter.”

on thursday, hayes will retire from the bench. in an earlier interview with reuters, he declined to discuss the johnson case. asked whether he regrets any of the sentences he has handed out, he paused.

“i think, maybe, i could have been more sympathetic at times,” hayes said. “sometimes you miss a few.”"
New Security Law Gives China Sweeping Powers Over Hong Kong,201,hiwou8,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html,3,1593581212.0,,"china unveiled a contentious new law for hong kong late tuesday that grants the authorities sweeping powers to crack down on opposition to beijing at home and abroad with heavy prison sentences for vaguely defined political crimes.

the law’s swift approval in beijing signaled the urgency that the communist party leader, xi jinping, has given to expanding his control over hong kong to quash pro-democracy protests that evolved last year into an increasingly confrontational challenge to chinese rule.

the hong kong government issued the text of the legislation at 11 p.m. on tuesday, after weeks of unusual secrecy surrounding the drafting of the law in beijing. the law took effect immediately, even though the public was seeing it in full only for the first time.

the text provided a far-reaching blueprint for the authorities and the courts to suppress the city’s protest movement and for china’s national security apparatus to pervade many layers of hong kong’s society."
Russians Are Voting On 206 Reforms. The Most Important One Will Extend Putin's Rule,93,hj1nrq,https://www.npr.org/2020/06/30/885188348/russians-are-voting-on-206-reforms-the-most-important-one-will-extend-putins-rul?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=news,5,1593599425.0,,"russians are voting on 206 reforms. the most important one will extend putin's rule

a newly unveiled world war ii monument towered behind vladimir putin as the russian president made a final pitch for a july 1 vote on a raft of constitutional changes that include a ban on same-sex marriage and an affirmation of russians' faith in god.

""we are not just voting for amendments,"" putin said on state tv on tuesday. ""we are voting for the country in which we want to live, with modern education and health care, reliable social protections and an effective government accountable to the public.""

putin said the proposed changes will cement russians' values into their constitution. what he didn't mention was the amendment that will reset his term limits — allowing him to stay in power until 2036, when he'll turn 84.

putin's political future has been a subject of intense speculation ever since he won a fourth term in 2018. the russian constitution currently permits a limit of two consecutive presidential terms, six years each. at the completion of his second term, putin stepped aside to be prime minister and let a protégé, dmitry medvedev, serve one presidential term.

having first been elected president in 2000, putin is laying the groundwork to become russia's longest-serving ruler since peter the great three centuries ago.

putin's plan to hang onto power took shape in january, when he abruptly fired his cabinet and announced the need for sweeping constitutional changes. exactly how they might affect his own rule became clear only in march, when a senior lawmaker proposed an amendment making it possible for putin to run two more times.

both houses of parliament, russia's 85 regional assemblies and the constitutional court all rubber-stamped the package of amendments. but putin insisted they also get the blessing of the russian people in a national vote.

""to stay in charge, putin needs the support of the majority, even if it's a formality,"" writes andrei kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the carnegie moscow center. ""putin is using the public vote to make ordinary people his accomplices in extending his rule and sanctioning the domination of an ultraconservative ideology.""

putin planned for the vote to take place on april 22, followed by a giant military parade on may 9 marking the 75th anniversary of nazi germany's defeat in world war ii. as the coronavirus pandemic hit russia, putin reluctantly postponed the vote and then the parade.

""he was forced to yield to the power of the virus,"" says masha lipman, a political analyst in moscow. ""putin never concedes to pressure. i think this is a unique situation.""

even though russia has the third-highest number of coronavirus infections, after the united states and brazil, regional leaders loosened lockdown restrictions this month. putin's victory day parade was rescheduled for june 24 and the constitutional vote for july 1.

the two events are linked because both aim to strengthen putin's legitimacy, says alexander titov, a historian at queen's university belfast.

""there is very little beyond the victory in world war ii which unites russians,"" says titov. ""putin's whole idea is to bring back continuity between old czarist russia, the positive aspects of the soviet union and blend it in together with his own rule.""

originally putin had invited president trump and other western leaders to the victory day parade. in the end, the dignitaries who attended hailed mostly from former soviet republics.

""it must be hugely disappointing for putin that this great anniversary — which also was supposed to be a kind of crowning of him as a president for life — turned into a very small-scale affair,"" says titov.

the day after the parade, a week of early voting began on putin's ballot measure. voters are being asked to approve a package of 206 constitutional amendments with a single yes-or-no answer.

the central election commission says all necessary health and safety precautions are being taken at polling stations, with temperature measurements of voters and the availability of face masks and gloves.

television ads have featured russian actors and athletes endorsing putin's amendments.

pianist denis matsuev, a regular at new york's carnegie hall, appears in one such ad.

""our culture and our language are what make us strong, unique and unite us,"" he says. ""the constitutional amendments will preserve and protect our unique cultural code.""

the kremlin has emphasized that the amendments will strengthen russia's sovereignty and independence and the government's social obligations to its citizens.

critics say the vote bundles so many amendments together that its true purpose — securing putin's reign for years to come — is being obscured. they say that six days of early voting, electronic balloting in two regions and the lack of independent observers open up the possibility for widespread fraud.

in a video posted to social media, opposition leader lyubov sobol called the vote a ""disgrace.""

""if you think putin is our national leader and should rule for more than 20 years, then why not just call a referendum with one question: do you agree that putin should have a fifth term?"" she says. ""but they didn't call one.""

the fact that putin is going through the trouble of a national vote is a sign that he's concerned, says lipman.

""it is very important to him to have this popular endorsement, even if it is a farce, even if it is a travesty of popular will,"" she says. ""he produces the impression that he is no longer as confident as he used to be, and maybe this has to do with the decline in public approval and trust, combined with the fact that the russian economy is not in good shape, to say the least.""

on monday, a state-run polling agency published an exit poll showing 76% of voters who had cast ballots early supported the amendments.

for the kremlin, the result of the vote seems to be a foregone conclusion. copies of the constitution — complete with all the new amendments — are already being sold in moscow bookstores."
Low voter turnout in French local elections tells a tale of disillusionment,127,hjbexy,https://www.france24.com/en/20200629-low-voter-turnout-in-french-local-elections-tell-a-tale-of-disillusionment,9,1593643027.0,,"health concerns, a drawn-out campaign due to a delayed vote, mass rejection of state institutions and overwhelming disenchantment with politicians produced a near-record low voter turnout in sunday’s second round of the 2020 french municipal elections.

france’s green wave captured the headlines following sunday’s vote, with the french environmentalist party, europe écologie les verts (eelv), winning in major cities, like marseille, bordeaux, lyon and strasbourg. but behind the green sweep in the second round of the municipal elections lies another story: low voter turnout.

while france traditionally has higher voter turnout figures than the us, uk and many developed countries, the abstention levels in the latest poll have been staggering by french standards. nearly 60 percent of the country’s 16.5 million voters stayed away from the polls – around 12 points higher than in the second round of municipal elections in 2014.

""abstentions are the major feature of this evening,"" concluded chloé morin, head of the opinion observatory at the jean-jaurès foundation, on france 24’s election night special. it reached record highs in cities where the socialist party won, such as nantes (71.42 percent), rennes (68.32 percent) and lille (60 percent). in lyon, where the greens won, abstentions were an estimated 62 percent.

‘fear of contamination’

the civic malaise was clearly linked to the covid-19 pandemic, which had already affected voter turnout in the march 15 first round, when only 55.4 percent of voters nationwide cast their ballots, obvservers said.

""the context of the health crisis is still not over for voters,"" stressed bruno cautrès, researcher at the centre for political science research of sciences po (cevipof) on french news station franceinfo. ""the fear of contamination in polling stations,"" despite the health measures taken, was ""one of the main obstacles to participation"", according to cautrès.

for many, the first round of voting, which took place two days before france went into a nationwide coronavirus lockdown, was ""kind of traumatic"", morin said.

according to a sopra steria poll, 43 percent of respondents cited the risk of catching covid-19 as the main reason for their abstention.

the second election round, usually held a week after the first, was postponed this year by three months, further affecting mobilisation levels. ""the thread of the election was broken,"" morin said.

many observers see the high abstention rate as a repudiation of mayors, although opinion polls show they are still the most appreciated by the french among those holding political office.

longest campaign season in postwar history

the second round of municipal elections was also marked by an unusual campaign, the longest in france’s postwar history. “candidates and party officials were unable to campaign in local markets, hold meetings, rallies or knock on doors,"" pierre jacquemain, editor of the magazine regards, told france 24.

under the lockdown and social distancing measures, candidates were forced to campaign online, but ""this did not mobilise” the election or the media enough,"" continued jacquemain.

on the other hand, the abstention rate – not a record for postwar france, which hit its highest of 69.8 percent in the 2000 presidential term referendum – was not mirrored in contested cities. participation was high in several cities, including the southern city of perpignan (52.8 percent) and the eastern french city of nancy (57.9 percent compared to 62.9 percent in the first round).

but the low turnout is the result of a wider political saturation trend, according to experts. ""with the exception of the may 2019 european parliamentary elections, which saw a resurgence in voter participation, we are gradually seeing a form of democracy based on abstentions in france,"" warned cautrès, noting that while turnout is high for the presidential poll, other elections fail to motivate voters to cast their ballots.

in the sopra steria poll, 38 percent of respondents said they did not vote since they believed the elections will not change anything in their daily lives, while 27 percent said it was because they didn’t like any candidate or list.

‘cold insurrection against the country's institutions’

president emmanuel macron expressed his ""concern"", according to an élysée presidential palace statement, which noted that the low voter turnout was ""not very good news"".

french senate leader gérard larcher, of the centre-right les républicains party, was less diplomatic. ""once again, french abstentions win,” he said, regretting that ""mistrust is taking hold” of the country.

jean-luc mélenchon, populist leader of france’s far-left la france insoumise (france unbowed) party, worried about the ""civic strike"", calling it ""a form of cold insurrection against the country's institutions"". the abstention ""is a form of disengagement” now turned ""against the rules of the game to which the people no longer consent"", he said.

but mélenchon’s own france unbowed and the ruling la république en marche (lrem) were the biggest losers of sunday’s polls, leading morin to note that the discourse of high abstentions among these politicians was ""a way to minimise their defeat"". it remains to be seen whether french politicians will learn from it.

Ethiopian opposition politician held as protests continue,87,hjbkf4,https://www.france24.com/en/20200701-ethiopian-opposition-politician-held-as-protests-continue,2,1593643492.0,,"advertising read more

addis ababa (afp)

ethiopia police were on wednesday detaining leading opposition politician jawar mohammed, a move that risks inflaming ethnic tensions that have led to multiple deaths during protests in the capital and surrounds.

the capital addis ababa was rocked by a second day of protests which erupted on tuesday following the killing of hachalu hundessa, a popular oromo singer who was gunned down monday night.

at least eight people have been killed, according to an afp tally, in the oromia region which surrounds addis ababa and is the heartland of the country's largest ethnic group, the oromo.

jawar, a former media mogul who recently joined the opposition oromo federalist congress, was arrested in addis ababa along with 34 other people, federal police commissioner endeshaw tassew said in a statement late tuesday.

endeshaw said that as hachalu's body was being transported to his native town of ambo for burial, jawar and his supporters intercepted it and tried to return it to addis ababa, where a clash ensued.

""there was a disturbance between federal security forces and others, and in the process one member of the oromia special police force was killed,"" endeshaw said.

""the security forces have taken eight kalashnikovs, five pistols and nine radio transmitters from jawar mohammed's car,"" he said of the arrest.

the oromo media network -- which was founded by jawar before he left to become a politician -- reported there was a call for mass protests until he and the others were released.

- 'a dangerous situation' -

the internet remained cut off for a second day in a government bid to curb the unrest.

in october, reports that the government was attempting to remove jawar's security detail kicked off days of violence that left more than 80 people dead.

hachalu's music gave voice to oromo feelings of marginalisation that were at the core of years of anti-government protests that swept prime minister abiy ahmed to power in 2018.

the motive for his killing has not been identified, but police have said ""some suspects"" have been arrested.

in addis ababa -- where protesters grouped at several points around the city -- security forces on wednesday fired into the air to disperse demonstrators who were approaching a statue of emperor menelik ii, widely seen as the creator of modern-day ethiopia.

oromo nationalists see menelik as a driving force behind their perceived marginalisation, and hachalu called earlier this month for the statue to be pulled down.

on tuesday protesters in harar in eastern ethiopia pulled down a statue of ras mekonnen, the father of emperor haile selassie, a doctor in the city told afp on condition of anonymity, also reporting the death of one person during protests.

- 'everything is closed' -

in the town of nekemte in western ethiopia, a doctor at the wollega university hospital, negeo tesfye, told afp: ""yesterday there was a clash between protesters and local police, three people were then shot by regional special forces. two of those people died.""

""currently everything is closed down, there is no transportation, people are not moving around,"" he said.

medical sources and relatives on tuesday reported three deaths in central adama, and another in western hararge.

federal police said several people had also been killed during three grenade attacks in the capital, without giving exact figures.

ethiopia, an ethnic melting pot of 100 million people, has battled deadly intercommunal tensions in recent years, a major threat to efforts by prime minister abiy ahmed -- himself an oromo -- to bring about democratic reforms in a country long ruled with an iron fist from addis ababa.

""the assassination of an important oromo musician, subsequent protests which have in places involved property destruction and security forces using lethal force, and the arrest of oromo leaders, creates a dangerous situation and is another blow to ethiopia's troubled transition,"" said william davison, an analyst with the international crisis group.

Putin wins right to extend his rule until 2036 in landslide vote,110,hjjxr5,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/01/putin-wins-right-to-extend-his-rule-until-2036-in-landslide-vote-347151,12,1593668995.0,,"the amendments will ""reset"" the two-term presidential limit to zero, allowing putin to run for another two six-year, consecutive mandates after his current term ends in 2024. he has already led russia for more than two decades, as either president or prime minister.

putin has said he is yet to decide whether he would run again. if he does run in the next elections, set for 2024 and 2030, he could be in charge longer than any ruler since peter the great, including joseph stalin. by the time of the 2036 election, putin would be 83.

the outcome of the election was never in doubt: copies of russia’s new constitution went on sale in bookstores days before the results were known.

voting took place amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic, with some polling stations set up in parks and other outdoor locations. there were reports of widespread irregularities including inconsistent tallies of results, and voters being pressured to go to the polls to increase turnout.

late last month, putin ordered a one-off payment of 10,000 roubles to be made to those with children under 16, with the cash starting to flow into bank accounts on polling day wednesday. as is now customary in russia, polling stations held raffles and competitions with prizes, while companies were asked to boost their employees' turnout and given the ability to check whether their workers voted, reuters reported.

russia also issued 500,000 new passports and 29,000 temporary certificates to allow more people to vote, first deputy minister of internal affairs alexander gorovoy said in a statement on twitter.

opposition leader alexei navalny called the results ""fake and an enormous lie"" and the vote ""invalid, illegal,"" in a statement. ""we will never recognize this result,"" he added.

navalny called for his supporters to take to the streets in september, when he said the peak of the coronavirus pandemic should have passed. “what putin fears most,"" navalny said, ""is the street,"" calling for ""hundreds of thousands and millions"" to protest.

russia's central election commission (cec) said it had received 7,196 complaints from citizens about the vote, 591 of them on election day. the cec considered 92 percent of all the complaints, but none required consideration at a meeting of the commission, it said.

the vote was originally set for april but was postponed due to the pandemic. the ballot was stretched out over seven days, culminating on wednesday, as a preventative measure at a time when russia has been reporting thousands of new covid-19 cases each day.

"Russia did pay extremists to attack US soldiers in Afghanistan, according to 3 separate Taliban sources",114,hjlda4,https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-did-pay-extremists-attack-american-soldiers-taliban-sources-say-2020-7,6,1593673620.0,,"sources in the taliban — two current commanders and one former — have confirmed to insider that russia pays extremists in afghanistan to attack us soldiers.

the practice was first reported by the new york times, which cited us intelligence. president donald trump has sought to deny that the practice exists.

the taliban sources were clear that this took place and said iran and pakistan do it too.

they emphasized that only fringe elements of the taliban take part and said they did not support taking money from foreign powers in this way.

one said: ""these are criminal groups that work alongside the mujahideen and give us a bad reputation."" another said the practice was a necessary evil.

visit insider's homepage for more stories.

taliban commanders have confirmed that russia has offered financial and material support to its members in exchange for attacking us forces in afghanistan.

the practice was first reported on friday by the new york times, which cited us intelligence officials.

president donald trump has since strongly denied that he was told of this intelligence and attacked its credibility, characterizing the existence of russian bounty payments as fake.

but three separate taliban sources told insider they were aware of russian bounty payments being made — though they said only the less-disciplined elements on the fringes of the group would take up such an offer.

when reached through formal channels, officials with the taliban — formally called the islamic emirate of afghanistan — declined to comment.

but the three sources all confirmed the practice takes place and that russian intelligence officials are known to pay. iran and pakistan also fund these activities, the sources said.

two of the sources are actively involved with the taliban, and one is now a refugee in greece who entered the country in 2016. all said they personally had not undertaken russian bounty operations and disparaged the practice in general.

a well-known way to get money

the refugee spoke on condition of anonymity to insider for fear of retaliation, though his identity is known to insider. he used to be a commander with the taliban in the logar province of afghanistan.

he said: ""the taliban is like my fist — the center of the fist is hard and disciplined; everyone gets salaries and weapons from the quetta shura and they obey orders.""

the quetta shura is the leadership council of the taliban that is thought to be based in pakistan.

""but around this fist there are a lot of groups and commanders that are with the taliban but not controlled by the taliban,"" he added. ""these are the people who will do anything for money, and russia, iran, pakistan, and other countries will hire them for operations.""

he said he was never offered money by russian intelligence, which he said worked in a different part of afghanistan where there were historic links from the days of the soviet union.

but he said he was regularly approached by iran and the specially designated terrorist organization run by the haqqani family out of northern pakistan. he said it was well-known that groups in need of money could work with russians.

but he was skeptical that accepting such payments would advance the taliban's cause in the long term. ""these people will not just leave,"" he said. ""they did not spend the money because we are friends. they spent it to kill their american enemies.""

'they give us a bad reputation'

moulani baghdadi, a current taliban commander from ghazni province, provided insider a statement via a family member.

he said russian influence inside the taliban itself was impossible but that there were many affiliated groups that have maintained ties with russia.

""in the last five years the islamic emirate has greatly expanded in kunduz and mazar because individual commanders have been receiving money and weapons from russian intelligence,"" he said. ""these are criminal groups that work alongside the mujahideen and give us a bad reputation with many people because they sell drugs and commit crimes and work with [foreigners].""

mujahideen is a broad term that islamic extremists use to refer to one another.

'after victory, we will make them stop'

a third taliban official discussed the situation with insider via facebook from pakistan. the official, whom insider reached via a trusted intermediary, did not give a name.

when he was asked why fighters would do the bidding of foreign powers, he replied: ""money, everyone needs money.""

the official characterized such missions as a necessary evil, like the widespread opium trade in afghanistan, which the taliban objects to on religious grounds but tolerates.

he said: ""opium is such an important crop to a poor country like afghanistan, we cannot stop the farmers from growing because they need to eat — it's the same with some of these criminal groups.

""we know they are committing crimes for now because they need to survive. but after victory, we will make them stop again like we did in the 1990s.""

an open secret in intelligence circles

a nato military intelligence official confirmed that the practice was well-known to western powers as well.

the official represents a nation with troops in afghanistan and requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

he said us intelligence briefed his agency on the issue last week and that russian bounty operations were most common in northern afghanistan.

he said: ""[the germans] have a major presence in the north and this briefing was very much focused on the increased threat to these units by local groups paid by the russians for attacks.""

trump has continued to deny the existence of the practice. in a tweet on wednesday, he said intelligence on russia paying bounties was poorly corroborated and exaggerated by the media to damage him politically.

the tweet said: ""'no corroborating evidence to back reports.' department of defense. do people still not understand that this is all a made up fake news media hoax started to slander me & the republican party.

""i was never briefed because any info that they may have had did not rise to that level."""
Exclusive: BBC tells staff not to wear Black Lives Matter badges on air,34,hjm3wf,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/01/exclusive-bbc-bans-black-lives-matters-badges-air/,10,1593676162.0,,"but after the blm uk campaign issued a barrage of politically-charged tweets earlier this week, sky sports presenters including the former england player matt le tissier said they were uneasy about wearing badges after becoming concerned at the campaign’s far-left activism.

a spokesman for the premier league, meanwhile, distanced themselves from blm, saying it recognised “the importance of the message that black lives matter” but did not “endorse any political organisation or movement, nor support any group that calls for violence or condones illegal activity”.

sources at the bbc, however, revealed the corporation had always deemed black lives matter a political campaign, and had therefore deemed that the wearing symbols of support would fall foul of impartiality guidelines.

the source would not confirm whether any on-screen figures had been refused permission to wear a badge during bbc coverage.

“the bbc cannot be seen to support any kind of cause over another, and black lives matter is certainly a campaign,” the bbc source said.

“therefore we wouldn’t want anyone on-screen to be wearing visual symbols of support.

“our presenters and guests can discuss black lives matter, and we’ve reported on it in depth. we’re not impartial about racism.

“but wearing badges on screen - just as with any other campaign - would be a step too far.”

on wednesday, tottenham hotspur became the first football club to publicly break with the movement after black lives matter uk issued a barrage of tweets suggesting british politics had been “gagged of the right to critique zionism”.

in a letter to a concerned fan, seen by the telegraph, executive director donna-maria cullen said the club’s jewish chairman daniel levy had been “equally disappointed” by the tweets.

“it is unacceptable that a value-based action is being hijacked by those with their own political agenda,” ms cullen wrote.

meanwhile, hertfordshire police appeared to row back on earlier advice it issued to its officers on whether they should 'take the knee' at black lives matter marches.

in june the force said that while it is a ""personal"" decision, the symbol of solidarity receives a ""positive reaction"" from protesters and officers who choose not to do it ""may become the focus of the protesters' attention"".

assistant chief constable bill jephson of hertfordshire police conceded today that 'taking the knee' isn't always ""appropriate"".

""as such the force neither encourages nor discourages officers from taking the knee, but directs that in some operational situations it is not appropriate. as with many aspects of policing we will keep our position under review,” he said.

meanwhile northumberland county council removed a post on its social media pages that had endorsed the black lives matter group.

conservative councillor peter jackson said the blm organisation had “definitely strayed into the political arena” and it was therefore inappropriate for the council to publicly support it.

“it’s quite clear to me and to possibly the silent majority that there are a number of what you would call political extremists creating what looks more like a political movement than a race equality movement,” he said.

“when we get mindless vandalism, when we get talk of de-funding the police and attacks on the police, and when we get people effectively trying to rewrite history, it looks likes a political movement to me,” he added."
Hundreds Of Former Bush Officials Unite To Endorse Joe Biden,209,hjm6py,https://www.npr.org/2020/07/01/886346437/hundreds-of-former-bush-officials-unite-to-endorse-joe-biden,6,1593676446.0,,"hundreds of former bush officials unite to endorse joe biden

a group of former george w. bush administration officials has pledged to ""engage and mobilize disenchanted gop voters"" through a new super pac formed to elect joe biden to the white house.

the group — 43 alumni for biden, a reference to bush, the 43rd president — described its formation as an effort to restore ""the principles of unity, tolerance and compassion to the greatest elected office in the world.""

""for four years, we have watched with grave concern as the party we loved has morphed into a cult of personality that little resembles the party of lincoln and reagan,"" said karen kirksey, the group's director.

""we endorse joe biden not necessarily in full support of his political agenda but rather in full agreement with the urgent need to restore the soul of this nation. once elected, we look forward to working in a bipartisan way through civil, spirited debate on the many important issues facing americans today and for decades to come.""

the group, consisting of hundreds of former bush officials, is the latest effort by establishment republicans to reject the leadership of president trump, who sailed to the presidency in the 2016 election on a blistering, divisive campaign centered on nationalism and a rejection of the politically correct.

the nov. 3 faceoff between trump and biden will be a referendum on both the policies and the posture that trump has brought to american politics over the last several years. issues including the faltering u.s. economy, the coronavirus pandemic and the administration's response to it, as well as climate change, are all expected to play heavily into voters' considerations.

by announcing its formation on july 1, the group will effectively avoid disclosing its donors until mid-october, less than three weeks before the election.

had it announced the day before, it would have had to file a list of donors with the federal election commission by mid-july.

'You’ve been warned': Florida sheriff says he may deputize gun owners against protesters,369,hjukp3,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/01/florida-sheriff-says-he-may-deputize-gun-owners-against-protesters/5357157002/,34,1593714432.0,[deleted],"close in a video produced by clay county sheriff's office, the sheriff said he will deputize ""every lawful gun owner"" in his county if protests turn violent. wochit

jacksonville, fla. – clay county sheriff darryl daniels, no stranger to making viral videos appealing to tough-on-crime politics, released a video tuesday that said he will make “special deputies of every lawful gun owner in this county” if he feels the county is overwhelmed by protesters.

the three-minute video shows daniels standing in front of 18 deputies as he derides civil rights protesters as godless disruptors and tells them to stay out of clay county, a suburb of jacksonville.

""if we can’t handle you, i’ll exercise the power and authority as the sheriff, and i’ll make special deputies of every lawful gun owner in this county and i’ll deputize them for this one purpose to stand in the gap between lawlessness and civility,"" he said.

""that’s what we’re sworn to do. that’s what we’re going to do. you’ve been warned.""

daniels, the county’s first black sheriff, is himself under investigation by the florida department of law enforcement related to an affair he had with a fellow officer when he was at the jacksonville sheriff’s office and a subsequent false arrest of that officer.

qualified immunity: why police are protected from civil lawsuits, trials

daniels is a first-term sheriff up for reelection who has said he wants to one day be a congressman. he is being challenged by six opponents, including former atlantic beach police chief michelle cook, former clay county sheriff’s office emergency management director ben carroll and mike taylor, a former fdle agent and state attorney’s investigator who has earned the endorsement of former gov. jeb bush.

his challengers accused him of inviting chaos to clay county and insulting the training necessary to become a sheriff’s deputy.

“we train under intense situations to control the adrenaline dump,” taylor said, “and we don’t do a perfect job at it, but we train to be prepared to make decisions under pressure. that’s necessary to be effective. to think we can put anyone in that role and it’ll be ok, we’re asking for a much bigger problem and inviting chaos and anarchy in the streets. the citizens of clay county deserve better than that.”

taylor added that deputizing private citizens could make the county liable to pay out lawsuits if the newly deputized citizens don’t act appropriately. “i don’t believe it was intended to be a pro-police message. i believe it was intended to be a propaganda message. real police professionalism actually acknowledges that professionally trained police officers cannot be replaced by a swearing-in ceremony.”

cook said the video was a sign daniels wasn’t capable of leading. “what daniels said yesterday may sound tough and macho. but, instead, it is a call for vigilantism and another signal that he is incapable of leading the sheriff’s department and keeping clay county safe.”

she added: “instead of dealing with real issues in a meaningful way, he is behaving like a reality show sheriff and calling attention to himself. to make matters worse, he pulled 18 officers off the streets to be used as props for his taxpayer-funded campaign stunt. it’s no wonder morale is so low among our fine officers.”

carroll, who spent 14 years at the sheriff’s office, said he runs a nonprofit that trains churches and private schools, and he believes it’s foolish to think private citizens could replace deputies.

“i’m sure that was a political production for the sheriff. i doubt seriously that there will ever be the need in clay county to deputize all the citizens to stand in the gap. i believe the sheriff’s department is totally capable of standing in the pike.”

carroll said he supports citizens owning and training to use firearms to protect themselves, but he believes the sherrif’s office must be capable of handling protesters on its own.

FBI arrests Jeffrey Epstein friend Ghislaine Maxwell sex case,126,hjxeu0,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/fbi-arrests-jeffrey-epstein-friend-ghislaine-maxwell-sex-case.html,17,1593726806.0,,"the fbi arrested jeffrey epstein's long-time friend ghislaine maxwell in new hampshire on thursday on federal charges of conspiring with him to sexually abuse children as young as 14, and for lying about her alleged conduct as his procurer. the arrest of the wealthy british socialite following a six-count criminal indictment issued monday in manhattan federal court comes just days before the first anniversary of the now-dead epstein's arrest on child sex trafficking charges. during a hearing thursday afternoon, a federal magistrate judge ordered that maxwell be sent to manhattan in the custody of u.s. marshal to face the charges, and to have another judge determine whether to grant her bail. prosecutors are asking for the 58-year-old maxwell be held without bail, and also said they are continuing to investigate the case. maxwell is ""an extreme flight risk,"" who faces the prospect of serving ""many years in prison,"" prosecutors said in a court filing. that filing also noted that maxwell, the daughter of the late crooked media mogul robert maxwell, has extensive international connections, citizenship in britain and france, passports from the u.s., united kingdom and france, and large sums of money. lawrence vogelman, maxwell's criminal defense lawyer, declined to comment on the charges. epstein, a 66-year-old financier and convicted sex offender who was a former friend of presidents donald trump and bill clinton, and of britain's prince andrew, killed himself in a federal jail in manhattan last august after being denied bail, authorities have said. if maxwell also is denied bail, she could be housed in that same jail where epstein died after being sent to new york to face charges.

maxwell is the first person charged in connection with epstein's alleged sexual abuse of underage girls other than him. epstein's victims have called for maxwell's arrest ever since epstein was charged last july. a former girlfriend of epstein, who was once paid to manage his properties, maxwell has long been accused by victims of helping him to acquire a steady stream of young women to satisfy his compulsive obsession with receiving several ""massages"" each day. maxwell was arrested at around 8:30 a.m. et in bradford, new hampshire, after having returned to the united states at some point. ""more recently, we learned she had slithered away to a gorgeous property in new hampshire, continuing to live a life of privilege while her victims live with the trauma inflicted upon them years ago,"" william sweeney, assistant director in charge of the fbi's new york office, said at the press conference. the 156-acre property where maxwell was apprehended was bought for $1 million in december by a limited liability corporation that was anonymized to hide the identity of the person or persons behind the purchase, according to prosecutors. the real estate agent who handled the sale for the seller told cnbc that she was unaware of the buyer's actual identity because the buyer's representatives would not disclose it. maxwell, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, is charged in the indictment helping epstein in the mid-1990s recruit and groom underage girls, at least one as young as 14 years old, so that he could sexually abuse them at his residences in new york city, palm beach, florida, and santa fe, new mexico, as well as at maxwell's home in london. the conduct charged in the case against maxwell predates by a decade or more the conduct that epstein was charged with last year. ""in some instances, maxwell was present for and participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims,"" the indictment charged. it also said that while under oath, maxwell ""repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct"" during a legal deposition in 2016 as part of a lawsuit. audrey strauss, the acting u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york, which is prosecuting the case, said at a press conference that maxwell had lied under oath about her conduct with the victims ""because the truth was almost unspeakable."" ""she pretended to be a woman [the victims] could trust, all the while they were setting them up to be abused by epstein and in some cases by maxwell herself,"" strauss said. strauss also said her office ""would welcome"" prince andrew ""coming in and giving us an opportunity to hear his statement"" about his relationship with epstein and maxwell. prince andrew previously has denied a claim by one of epstein's victims that he had sex with her at the direction of maxwell. strauss, echoing the claims made in the indictment, said that epstein and maxwell had a ""method"" for luring young girls in order to give ""sexualized massages"" to epstein, which sometimes evolved into sex with epstein and with maxwell on occasion. that method was said to involve epstein and maxwell befriending young girls ""by asking them about their lives,"" taking them to movies, and ""treating them to shopping trips,"" strauss said. ""maxwell encouraged girls to accept epstein's offers to pay for their travel and education ... making them feel indebted to epstein,"" the prosecutor said. to further groom the victims, ""maxwell would discuss sexual topics with the victims, and undress in front of them and be present for sex acts,"" strauss said. ""maxwell's presence as an adult woman [during massages of epstein by the victims] would put the girls at ease."" the top prosecutor and the fbi urged other people who may have been abused by epstein to contact them. in their motion seeking maxwell's detention without bail, prosecutors wrote that she ""has effectively been in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against epstein was unsealed in july 2019."" the filing stated that maxwell has 15 different bank accounts, and has ""made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice, switching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ""g max"") and email address, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label."" the motion also said that epstein, between 2007 and 2011, transferred more than $20 million from his own accounts to maxwell, and that she later sent him back some of those funds.

one of epstein's accusers voiced relief about maxwell's arrest. ""today, my fellow epstein survivors and i are able to take a breath of relief, as maxwell's arrest means some justice for survivors can exist,"" jennifer araoz said in a statement. ""for years, i feared epstein and his ring. maxwell was the center of that sex trafficking ring. now that the ring has been taken down, i know that i can't be hurt anymore. day after day, i have waited for the news that maxwell would be arrested and held accountable for her actions. her arrest is a step in that direction, and it truly means that the justice system didn't forget about us."" maxwell's prosecution by the southern district of new york comes less than two weeks after the former head of the office, u.s. attorney geoffrey berman, was fired by president trump. the office is now being led on a temporary basis by strauss, berman's former deputy. berman, in the months before his termination, repeatedly said his office was investigating epstein's co-conspirators. the indictment released thursday, which was handed up by a federal grand jury in manhattan, said the charges stem from maxwell's role ""in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by jeffrey epstein."" ""in particular, from at least in and about 1994, up to and including in or about 1997, maxwell assisted, facilitated, and contributed to jeffrey epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abused victims known to maxwell and epstein to be under the age of 18,"" the indictment said. ""the victims were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by maxwell and epstein, both of whom knew that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18."" the indictment includes photographs of the residences where epstein allegedly abused his victims. the indictment charges maxwell with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sexual acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and two counts of perjury. the charging document, in citing evidence for the perjury charges, noted that during an april 2016 deposition of maxwell taken in new york as part of a lawsuit, she was asked, ""did jeffrey epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages?"" ""i don't know what you're talking about,"" maxwell said. during another deposition in july 2016, maxwell said, ""i wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone when i was with him other than myself."" one of epstein's accusers, virginia giuffre, has said in unsealed depositions that maxwell directed her to have sex with prince andrew; former senate majority leader george mitchell, a maine democrat; former new mexico gov. bill richardson; hedge funder glenn dubin; late mit scientist marvin minsky; modeling company founder jean-luc brunel; as well as with the owner of a large hotel chain, and another prince. ""there was, you know, another foreign president, i can't remember his name,"" giuffre said in one deposition. ""he was spanish. there's a whole bunch of them that i just — it's just so hard for me to remember all of them."" ""i was told to do something by these people constantly ... my whole life revolved around just pleasing these men and keeping ghislaine and jeffrey happy,"" giuffre said in the deposition. ""their whole entire lives revolved around sex."" richardson and mitchell have denied ever meeting guiffre, much less having sex with her. prince andrew last year denied having sex with her, as did dubin and brunel. the deposition excerpts released last year are part of a defamation lawsuit that giuffre filed against maxwell several years ago. the suit accused maxwell of calling giuffre a liar for claiming that maxwell and epstein sexually abused her when she was underage."

russian voters have overwhelmingly backed a referendum on constitutional changes that includes a provision allowing president vladimir putin — who has already served for some two decades — to remain in power until 2036.

with nearly all of the ballots counted, the tally for the voting that has taken place over a full week showed a 78% ""yes"" vote, according to russia's central election commission. the commission estimated the turnout was 65% of eligible voters.

the opposition accused the government of rigging the vote.

russia's constitution had required putin to step down after his current six-year term expires in 2024.

the amendments to the constitution up for the referendum vote had been passed weeks ago by russia's parliament, but putin had insisted that they be approved by voters to give the changes legitimacy.

the referendum had originally been scheduled for april 22 but was postponed because of the covid-19 pandemic. russia is among the countries hardest-hit by the virus.

in addition to a reset of presidential terms allowing him to run twice more, the referendum includes some 200 other amendments, including guaranteed minimum pensions, a ban on same-sex marriage and an affirmation of the russian people's belief in god.

it also includes changes designed to strengthen the country's state council and a provision banning the relinquishing of any russian territory — a move aimed at solidifying moscow's hold on crimea, which had been under ukraine's control until it was annexed by russia in 2014.

putin was photographed voting at the royal academy of sciences, where he was handed a ballot by a poll worker clad in mask and gloves as an apparent precaution against coronavirus infection. putin himself was not wearing any protective gear.

in january, putin's cabinet, including prime minister dmitry medvedev, abruptly resigned in a move aimed at easing the constitutional changes.

putin, who is 67, could serve well into his 80s.

the russian leader previously sidestepped the two-term limit by becoming prime minister for a term while medvedev stepped into the presidency. even so, putin was widely seen as maintaining near complete control over the presidency during his brief absence from the post."

xinjiang is an autonomous rural region in the northwest of china and home to roughly 11 million uyghurs, a predominantly muslim ethnic minority with a distinct culture and language. until recently, there were many more uyghurs in xinjiang than han chinese , the ethnic majority that makes up the rest of the country.

the us state department estimates that over one million uyghurs have been detained in a massive network of internment camps in xinjiang, where they are reportedly ""subjected to torture, cruel and inhumane treatment such as physical and sexual abuse, forced labor, and death.""

in addition to political indoctrination, former detainees have told cnn that they experienced sleep deprivation, lack of food and forced injections.

this is the second time this year that the cbp has seized products from china suspected to have been made from prisoner's hair.

""it is absolutely essential that american importers ensure that the integrity of their supply chain meets the humane and ethical standards expected by the american government and by american consumers,"" said brenda smith, executive assistant commissioner of the cbp office of trade.

""the production of these goods constitutes a very serious human rights violation, and the detention order is intended to send a clear and direct message to all entities seeking to do business with the united states that illicit and inhumane practices will not be tolerated in u.s. supply chains.""

(atomic energy organization of iran via ap)

dubai, united arab emirates (ap) — a fire and an explosion struck a centrifuge production plant above iran’s underground natanz nuclear enrichment facility early thursday, analysts said, one of the most-tightly guarded sites in all of the islamic republic after earlier acts of sabotage there.

the atomic energy organization of iran sought to downplay the fire, calling it an “incident” that only affected an under-construction “industrial shed,” spokesman behrouz kamalvandi said. however, both kamalvandi and iranian nuclear chief ali akbar salehi rushed after the fire to natanz, a facility earlier targeted by the stuxnet computer virus and built underground to withstand enemy airstrikes.

the fire threatened to rekindle wider tensions across the middle east, similar to the escalation in january after a u.s. drone strike killed a top iranian general in baghdad and tehran launched a retaliatory ballistic missile attack targeting american forces in iraq.

while offering no cause for thursday’s blaze, iran’s state-run irna news agency published a commentary addressing the possibility of sabotage by enemy nations such as israel and the u.s. following other recent explosions in the country.

“the islamic republic of iran has so far has tried to prevent intensifying crises and the formation of unpredictable conditions and situations,” the commentary said. but ”the crossing of red lines of the islamic republic of iran by hostile countries, especially the zionist regime and the u.s., means that strategy ... should be revised.”

the fire began around 2 a.m. local time in the northwest corner of the natanz compound in iran’s central isfahan province, according to data collected by a u.s. national oceanic and atmospheric administration satellite that tracks fires from space.

images later released by iranian state media show a two-story brick building with scorch marks and its roof apparently destroyed. debris on the ground and a door that looked blown off its hinges suggested an explosion accompanied the blaze.

“there are physical and financial damages and we are investigating to assess,” kamalvandi told iranian state television. “furthermore, there has been no interruption in the work of the enrichment site. thank god, the site is continuing its work as before.”

in washington, the state department said that u.s. officials were “monitoring reports of a fire at an iranian nuclear facility.”

“this incident serves as another reminder of how the iranian regime continues to prioritize its misguided nuclear program to the detriment of the iranian people’s needs,” it said.

the site of the fire corresponds to a newly opened centrifuge production facility, said fabian hinz, a researcher at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies at the middlebury institute of international studies in monterey, california.

hinz said he relied on satellite images and a state tv program on the facility to locate the building, which sits in natanz’s northwest corner.

david albright of the institute for science and international security similarly said the fire struck the production facility. his institute previously wrote a report on the new plant, identifying it from satellite pictures while it was under construction and later built.

iranian nuclear officials did not respond to a request for comment about the analysts’ comments. however, any damage to the facility would be a major setback, said hinz, who called the fire “very, very suspicious.”

“it would delay the advancement of the centrifuge technology quite a bit at natanz,” hinz said. “once you have done your research and development, you can’t undo that research and development. targeting them would be very useful” for iran’s adversaries.

natanz, also known as the pilot fuel enrichment plant, is among the sites now monitored by the international atomic energy agency after iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. that deal saw iran agree to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

the iaea said in a statement it was aware of reports of the fire. “we currently anticipate no impact on the iaea’s safeguards verification activities,” the vienna-based agency said.

natanz became a flashpoint for western fears about iran’s nuclear program in 2002, when satellite photos showed iran building an underground facility at the site, some 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the capital, tehran. in 2003, the iaea visited natanz, which iran said would house centrifuges for its nuclear program, buried under some 7.6 meters (25 feet) of concrete.

natanz today hosts the country’s main uranium enrichment facility. in its long underground halls, centrifuges rapidly spin uranium hexafluoride gas to enrich uranium. currently, the iaea says iran enriches uranium to about 4.5% purity — above the terms of the nuclear deal but far below weapons-grade levels of 90%. workers there also have conducted tests on advanced centrifuges, according to the iaea.

the u.s. under president donald trump unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal in may 2018, setting up months of tensions between tehran and washington. iran now is breaking all the production limits set by the deal, but still allows iaea inspectors and cameras to watch its nuclear sites.

natanz remains of particular concern to tehran as it has been targeted for sabotage before. the stuxnet malware, widely believed to be an american and israeli creation, disrupted and destroyed centrifuges at natanz amid the height of western concerns over iran’s nuclear program.

satellite photos show an explosion last friday that rattled iran’s capital came from an area in its eastern mountains that analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites. iran has blamed the blast on a gas leak in what it describes a “public area.”

another explosion from a gas leak at a medical clinic in northern tehran killed 19 people tuesday.

yoel guzansky, a senior fellow at israel’s institute for national security studies and former iran analyst for the prime minister’s office, said he didn’t know if there was an active sabotage campaign targeting tehran. however, he said the series of explosions in iran feel like “more than a coincidence.”

“theoretically speaking, israel, the u.s. and others have an interest to stop this iran nuclear clock or at least show iran there’s a price in going that way,” he said. “if iran won’t stop, we might see more accidents in iran.”

late thursday, the bbc’s persian service said it received an email prior to the announcement of the natanz fire from a group identifying itself as the cheetahs of the homeland, claiming responsibility for an attack on the centrifuge production facility at natanz. this group, which claimed to be dissident members of iran’s security forces, had never been heard of before by iran experts and the claim could not be immediately authenticated by the ap.

U.S. Surpasses Global Record For New COVID-19 Cases Recorded In A Day,256,hkjxz4,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/03/887014363/u-s-surpasses-global-record-for-new-covid-19-cases-recorded-in-a-day,8,1593815089.0,,"u.s. surpasses global record for new covid-19 cases recorded in a day

the united states has reached a daily global record for the coronavirus pandemic — reporting more than 55,000 new covid-19 cases. the daily u.s. tally stood at 55,274 late thursday, which exceeds the previous single-day record of 54,771 set by brazil on june 19.

johns hopkins university & medicine's coronavirus resource center, which tracks the virus worldwide, says the total number of cases reported in the u.s. stands at 2,739,879, an increase of 53,399 over wednesday's figure.

brazil has the next highest number of cases with 1,496,858. russia rounds out the top three with 660,231 cases. u.s. deaths attributed to the coronavirus stands at 128,740. brazil ranks second with 61,884 deaths and the united kingdom third with 44,080 deaths.

as infections spike in the u.s., a number of states are taking action to try to slow the spread of cases.

florida's surge of covid-19 cases shows no signs of slowing down. the state department of heath reported florida set another daily record thursday, with 10,109 cases, surpassing saturday's record of 9,585 cases.

the milestone continues a marked upturn in cases that began last month, weeks after florida started allowing businesses to reopen.

in texas, another coronavirus hot spot, wearing face masks is now required in most of the state.

gov. greg abbott issued an executive order on thursday requiring texans to wear face coverings in public in counties with 20 or more covid-19 cases. the announcement comes as covid-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to surge, with the state reporting 7,915 new cases on thursday.

kansas is also now requiring face coverings after a 46% spike in infections there last week. gov. laura kelly's order, with some exceptions, requires people to wear masks indoors or outdoors where 6 feet of social distancing cannot be maintained.

arizona is contending with one of the worst outbreaks of any state as coronavirus cases surge. hospitals are bracing for a wave of seriously ill patients, and health officials are pleading with the public to wear masks and heed guidance about social distancing — even in the absence of a second stay-at-home order.

arizona was quick to relax restrictions on businesses and reopen its economy, beginning in early may. most new cases have come in just the past month.

california, another coronavirus epicenter, saw positive tests climb 37% with hospitalizations up 56% over the past two weeks.

the los angeles county sheriff's department west hollywood station stepped up enforcement of an order from california gov. gavin newsom, saying in a facebook post that it would issue citations that come with a $250 fine and $50 in fees.

as the country celebrates the july fourth holiday weekend, health officials will be on alert. following may's memorial day holiday, coronavirus hospitalizations rose sharply in several states."
Confirmed coronavirus cases are rising in 40 of 50 states,122,hkoist,https://apnews.com/0468a60b64947879926d2a16e45c00ee,27,1593830610.0,,"fort lauderdale, fla. (ap) — four u.s. states — arizona, california, florida and texas — reported a combined 25,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases thursday as the infection curve rose in 40 of the 50 states heading into the july fourth holiday weekend.

with the number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases nationwide climbing past 50,000, an alarming 36 states saw an increase in the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus.

“what we’ve seen is a very disturbing week,” dr. anthony fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, said in a livestream with the american medical association.

in a major retreat that illustrated how dire things have become in texas , republican gov. greg abbott ordered the wearing of masks across most of the state after refusing until recently to let even local governments impose such rules.

the surge has been blamed in part on americans not covering their faces or following other social distancing rules as states lifted their lockdowns over the past few weeks. fauci warned that if people don’t start complying, “we’re going to be in some serious difficulty.”

the u.s. recorded 51,200 new confirmed cases wednesday, according to a tally kept by johns hopkins university. that represents a doubling of the daily total over the past month and is higher even than what the country witnessed during the most lethal phase of the crisis in april and may, when the new york metropolitan area was easily the worst hot spot in the u.s.

all but 10 states are showing an upswing in newly reported cases over the past 14 days, according to data compiled by the volunteer covid tracking project . the outbreaks are most severe in arizona, texas and florida, which together with california have reclosed or otherwise clamped back down on bars, restaurants and movie theaters over the past week or so.

nebraska and south dakota were the only states outside the northeast with a downward trend in cases.

while some of the increases may be explained by expanded testing, other indicators are grim, too, including hospitalizations and positive test rates. over the past two weeks, the percentage of positive tests has doubled in georgia, kansas, montana, michigan, missouri, tennessee, mississippi, south carolina and ohio. in nevada, it has tripled. in idaho, it is five times higher.

in texas, where new cases in the past two weeks have swelled from about 2,400 a day to almost 8,000 on wednesday, the positive rate ballooned from 8% to 14.5%. in arizona, it has gone from 5.7% to 10.3%.

abbott, who in may began one of the most aggressive reopening schedules of any governor, ordered the wearing of masks in all counties with at least 20 covid-19 cases.

abbott said in a video posted on twitter that the state’s lower infection rate and case counts after his stay-home order in april might have led some to think the “coast was clear.”

but the number of people hospitalized in texas because of covid-19 has quadrupled since late may, after businesses began reopening.

“we are now at a point where the virus is spreading so fast, there is little margin for error,” abbott said. “i know that wearing a face covering is not the convenient thing to do, but i also know that wearing a face covering will help us to keep texas open for business. and it will help texans earn the paycheck they need.”

the surge comes as americans head into a fourth of july holiday that health officials warn could add fuel to the outbreak by drawing big crowds. many municipalities have canceled fireworks displays. beaches up and down california and florida have been closed.

florida reported more than 10,000 new confirmed cases for the first time thursday. that is six times higher than the daily count of less than a month ago. the state also reported 67 deaths for the second time in a week and 325 new hospitalizations, one of the biggest 24-hour jumps in florida yet. georgia likewise saw its biggest single-day increase yet, nearly 3,500 cases.

“i’m discouraged because we didn’t act fast enough to shut things down, and we could have done a much better job getting a handle on the virus,” said megan archer, a 39-year-old woman from west palm beach, florida, who lost her job with a county parks department during the outbreak.

meanwhile, the government reported that u.s. unemployment fell to 11.1% in june as the economy added a solid 4.8 million jobs. but that figure may be outdated: the data was collected during the second week of june, before many states began to backtrack on restarting their economies.

several northeastern states have seen new infections slow down significantly, including new york, massachusetts, connecticut, rhode island and new jersey, which allowed its atlantic city casinos to reopen thursday, though with no smoking, drinking or eating.

pennsylvania, an outlier among northeastern states, reported its highest one-day total of new cases since may, with more than 830, more than one-quarter of them in pittsburgh’s allegheny county, which will impose a one-week shutdown of bars and restaurants and all gatherings of more than 25 people starting friday.

other states, like colorado, a major summer destination where increases in infections have been less dramatic, are keeping a close eye on their neighbors.

“i’ve been watching that map. ... we’re well aware of what’s going on around us and we’re very anxious,” said dr. michelle barron, medical director of infection prevention and control at uchealth university of colorado hospital. “the next couple of weeks are critical.”

president donald trump on wednesday seemed confident the virus would soon subside, telling fox business: “i think that, at some point, that’s going to sort of just disappear, i hope.”

the u.s. has reported at least 2.7 million cases and more than 128,000 dead, the highest toll in the world. globally there have been 10.7 million confirmed cases and over 517,000 deaths, according to johns hopkins’ count. the true toll is believed to be significantly higher, in part because of limited testing and mild cases that have been missed.

other countries are also reporting an upswing in cases.

“we have now entered a new and treacherous phase in the life cycle of this pandemic,” south african president cyril ramaphosa warned in a broadcast to the nation, which recorded more than 8,100 new infections, a one-day record, and has the biggest caseload on the continent.

india, the world’s second-most populous country with more than 1.3 billion people, has reported nearly 100,000 new cases in the past four days alone.

The NYPD Isn’t Giving Critical Bodycam Footage to Officials Investigating Alleged Abuse,285,hkt524,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-nypd-isnt-giving-critical-bodycam-footage-to-officials-investigating-alleged-abuse,11,1593847200.0,[deleted],"propublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

like many cities, new york city began equipping its police officers with body-worn cameras a few years ago. the footage is often invaluable evidence for the civilian agency charged with investigating complaints about nypd abuses.

but first, the agency’s investigators need to get the footage. and increasingly, the nypd is not turning it over.

in may, new york city’s civilian complaint review board requested body-worn camera footage for 212 cases involving possible misconduct but received only 33 responses, according to a recent internal memo.

the nypd’s responsiveness has “steadily gotten worse,” stated the memo, which was obtained by propublica. the memo warned that “the situation is untenable.”

the memo’s authors wrote that lack of access to body-worn camera footage reflects a broader issue. “the struggle for bwc,” or body-worn camera footage, they wrote, “is the struggle for the future of civilian oversight.” (here is the memo.)

if investigators get bodycam footage, ccrb data shows, they are far more likely to get to the bottom of a case. without it, they usually can’t, and often end up closing cases without finding out what really happened.

a spokesperson for the nypd said the coronavirus pandemic and other “unprecedented events” have caused the police to deploy “many officers into the field and away from administrative assignments.” the nypd noted that it has recently shared 703 videos related to complaints stemming from the police protests. (here is the nypd’s full statement.)

while the pandemic has exacerbated the issue, the nypd’s responsiveness began to be problematic much earlier. in early 2019, the percentage of alleged abuse cases waiting for nypd footage spiked more than fourfold, to 37%. a ccrb report noted “mounting delays in the receipt of key evidence, especially bwc footage.”

the delays in turning over footage can have a significant effect on whether police officers are held accountable when people come forward with accusations of misconduct, such as racially profiling or pistol-whipping a person. there’s an 18-month statute of limitations on bringing any discipline charges against nypd officers, whether the charges are initiated by the ccrb or by the department itself.

multiple entities have responsibility for investigating abuse and corruption by nypd officers. the nypd has its own internal investigators, and local and federal prosecutors, of course, can also bring criminal charges.

but it’s the ccrb that’s supposed to provide an independent venue for complaints against police. the agency has the authority to investigate everything from officers being discourteous to police violence against civilians. it was the ccrb’s investigation of the 2014 death of eric garner after an officer used a chokehold that ultimately led the nypd to fire the officer.

as propublica recently detailed, the nypd has nearly complete discretion over how much it cooperates with ccrb investigations. while the ccrb can recommend punishment, the police commissioner can and often does decide to do otherwise.

that discretion extends to footage from body-worn cameras. ccrb investigators have to submit individual requests. the nypd has often responded to the requests by saying the footage doesn’t exist — only for the ccrb to later discover it does.

the ccrb and nypd worked out an agreement last year to allow civilian investigators to be in the room while officers search for footage. implementation of the deal has been delayed by the pandemic. when it does start, ccrb investigators still won’t have direct access to the files.

other cities, such as washington, san francisco and new orleans, have created a much simpler process. they let civilian oversight investigators go right into the systems that store footage. “i can go and check myself,” a new orleans civilian oversight official told wnyc last year. “i can search by officer, i can search by location, i can search by date and time.”

the ccrb staffers who sent the memo wrote that their agency should have the same setup. they urged the agency’s leadership to “seize the moment and do everything possible in its power to obtain unmediated direct access to bwc footage.”

asked for comment, the chair of the ccrb, the rev. frederick davie, said in a statement that he agrees that investigators should have direct access. “the board and staff have long believed there should be unfettered access to body-worn camera footage, and i share their concern about the backlog,” said davie, who was appointed as chair in 2018 by mayor bill de blasio. “as we have seen in recent weeks with the influx of police misconduct allegations, direct access is a necessary tool for the ccrb to fairly and impartially investigate these matters as efficiently as possible.”

read more my family saw a police car hit a kid on halloween. then i learned how nypd impunity works. propublica deputy managing editor eric umansky’s family saw an unmarked nypd cruiser hit a black teenager. he tried to find out how it happened, and instead found all of the ways the nypd is shielded from accountability.

new york’s ccrb has long sought more authority and independence but has faced opposition from the nypd and police unions. when the agency was created nearly 70 years ago, it was led by nypd officials. the ccrb now has a 15-member board, appointed by the mayor, the city council and the police commissioner. it has about 200 investigators and other staff, who field about 7,000 complaints per year.

concerns about the nypd’s handling of body-worn camera footage not only predate the pandemic, they go beyond the backlog. a ccrb report from february that focused on bodycams said that a change in nypd policies last year “led to an increase in the number of cases where bwc footage was either redacted or withheld in its entirety.”

the report also said that the ccrb had found instances “where officers have used signals to prevent or halt the recording of police misconduct.” in other instances, the report said, officers warned colleagues that the cameras were on: “officers were frequently heard using phrases such as, ‘i went hollywood,’ ‘green,’ ‘i’m/we’re live,’ and ‘i’m hot.’”

bodycam footage can be quite valuable for officers facing allegations of abuse. the rate that the ccrb substantiates abuse more than doubles if it has footage — from 14% to 32%. but the rate of investigators concluding that complaints are unfounded also jumps: it triples, from 4% to 15%.

one of the authors of the recent ccrb warning on the backlog, olas carayannis, also circulated an internal memo last year about the very same issue. “unless there is a significant change, the backlog of ccrb requests for video evidence will continue to increase and will impair the ccrb’s ability to complete investigations within the 18-month statute of limitations,” carayannis wrote.

“the ccrb is currently in a position where it is missing necessary evidence in hundreds of cases, and is in jeopardy of exceeding the statute of limitations in those cases,” he added. (carayannis did not return messages from propublica.)

the backlog has gotten worse since then. as of last week, the new memo says, there were about 1,100 unfilled requests for footage.

Trump blasts 'left wing cultural revolution' at Mount Rushmore,54,hkx96j,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump/trump-blasts-left-wing-cultural-revolution-at-mount-rushmore-idUSKBN2441CB,21,1593865155.0,,"mount rushmore national memorial, s.d. (reuters) - president donald trump on friday accused “angry mobs” of trying to erase history with efforts to remove or rethink monuments to u.s. historical figures and used a speech at mount rushmore to paint himself as a bulwark against left-wing extremism.

on a day when seven u.s. states posted a record number of new covid-19 cases, the pandemic moved further into trump’s inner circle. kimberly guilfoyle, a senior campaign official and the girlfriend of donald trump jr., tested positive in south dakota before the event, according to sergio gor, a trump campaign official. trump jr. tested negative, gor said.

the pre-july 4 holiday event drew 7,500 people, packed into an outdoor amphitheater. many did not wear masks, defying the advice of health officials who have urged americans to avoid large gatherings to slow the spread of covid-19.

trump has not worn a mask in public and made only limited reference to the pandemic in his remarks.

speaking underneath the famed landmark depicting four u.s. presidents, trump warned that the demonstrations over racial inequality threatened the foundations of the u.s. political system.

“make no mistake, this left wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the american revolution,” trump said. “our children are taught in school to hate their own country.”

in the nationwide unrest following the death of george floyd, a black man who died in police custody in minneapolis, protesters in several cities have vandalized the statues of leaders, including confederate generals who led a rebellion against the u.s. government during the 1861-65 u.s. civil war.

protesters in one instance unsuccessfully tried to pull down a statue of u.s. president andrew jackson outside the white house. jackson, known for his populist policies, owned slaves and forced thousands of native americans from their homes.

“angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities,” trump said.

trump, a republican who has emphasized a “law and order” approach to the demonstrations, has opposed proposals to rename u.s. military bases that are named after confederate generals.

campaign crowd

the program was not an official campaign event, but trump touched on key themes meant to energize his base ahead of the nov. 3 election. many in the crowd wore trump memorabilia and chanted “four more years” before the program began.

trump trails presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden in opinion polls in key states and is eager to boost his campaign through a tough response to social unrest.

“there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance. if you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras, and follow its commandments then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, and punished. not gonna happen to us,” trump said.

mount rushmore, which depicts u.s. presidents george washington, thomas jefferson, theodore roosevelt and abraham lincoln, has not hosted a fireworks spectacle since 2009 because of environmental concerns.

trump advocated a resumption of the display, and the state says the surrounding black hills national forest has “gained strength” since then and that fireworks technology has advanced.

native american protesters were arrested after blocking a road to the south dakota landmark, according to video on social media. they have criticized trump’s visit for increasing the risk of spreading covid-19 and for celebrating u.s. independence in an area that is sacred to them.

south dakota, solidly republican, has not been infected as badly as other states, but cases in pennington county, where mount rushmore is, have more than doubled in the past month.

white house chief of staff mark meadows told reporters trump did not need to focus on the pandemic during a ceremony meant to highlight independence day.

trump praised each of the leaders depicted on mount rushmore. washington and jefferson, revered for being u.s. founding fathers, were slave owners.

the president will hold another celebration for the july 4 holiday on saturday in washington."
"U.S. Coronavirus Cases Are Rising Sharply, but Deaths Are Still Down",238,hl6bt7,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/health/coronavirus-mortality-testing.html,52,1593909716.0,,"numerous states recently began reopening their economies, which might be driving some of the youthful bias, said natalie dean, an infectious disease epidemiologist in florida, where new cases are hitting record highs. people in their 20s and 30s have returned to bars and beaches; working-age employees have resumed jobs that cannot be done from home.

“we know that’s high-risk,” dr. dean said. “we’re hearing a lot of reports of clusters being linked to these places” as they open back up.

at the same time, elderly individuals, as well as those with underlying health conditions thought to exacerbate covid-19, may be warier of exposure, said c. brandon ogbunu, a computational biologist and disease ecologist at yale university. “early on, this disease ripped through older populations with such aggression,” he said. “it’s possible that’s where the message was felt the most strongly.”

moreover, nursing homes and other facilities that harbor vulnerable populations may be working harder to protect their residents, dr. dean said. in general, “we now have a better set of tools to keep our communities safer,” he said. “more people are wearing masks. we’re better at sanitizing things.”

of course, “young people don’t live in isolation,” dr. bell said. they are still mingling with older members of the population — potentially seeding transmission events that have yet to appear.

looking ahead

experts can’t be sure, but behaviors like mask wearing, physical distancing and hygiene may also be reducing the dose of coronavirus that people encounter in the population at large, dr. dean said. the amount of virus that individuals carry may influence the severity of their symptoms. but so far, there is no evidence that this dynamic is contributing to the lower mortality rate in the united states.

there is also no indication that the death rate is lower because the coronavirus itself has become less deadly, dr. ogbunu said. mutation is a normal part of any virus’s evolutionary trajectory, but these genetic changes are often inconsequential."
India Is Paying the Price for Neglecting its Neighbors,20,hl9cux,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/23/india-china-south-asia-relations/,3,1593920608.0,,"india is paying the price for neglecting its neighbors

as india manages the fallout from its deadly clash with china last week—the first border skirmish in which there were troop fatalities since 1975—it would do well to take a step back and assess its broader regional situation. and if it does so, new delhi would realize that its problems are by no means limited to beijing: india’s relations with each of its neighbors are in shambles.

things could so easily have been different. in may 2014, shortly after being elected to office, prime minister narendra modi invited his counterparts from afghanistan, bangladesh, bhutan, the maldives, nepal, pakistan, and sri lanka—members of the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc)—to his inauguration. it was a deft exercise in public diplomacy, as no previous prime minister had made such a grand gesture. it was also in keeping with his bharatiya janata party’s campaign manifesto, which had promised to improve ties with india’s neighbors.

modi used the occasion to announce his “neighborhood first” initiative, a new focus on prioritizing relations with saarc member states. the project, had it come to fruition, would have given a much-needed boost to regional trade and investments and led the way in addressing geopolitical tensions. it would have also provided a natural—and lasting—bulwark against china’s relentless attempts to expand its footprint across the region, especially with its belt and road initiative.

modi’s initial steps certainly signaled his commitment to this new policy. in june 2014, he picked the himalayan india’s relations with each of its neighbors are in shambles.kingdom of bhutan for his first foreign visit as prime minister. the tour was in part a nod to bhutan’s substantial role in helping india end sanctuaries for insurgents in the state of assam. but despite this very promising start for regional relations, new delhi went on to somehow worsen relations across the board. consider the following: india nearly went to war with pakistan in 2019, and it has had frequent and high-profile border skirmishes that could easily get out of hand; ties with bangladesh, a country india helped birth into existence, are in the doldrums; nepal’s parliament has just approved a new map that includes land claimed by india, putting relations at their worst in years; and sri lanka and the maldives, both historically allied with india, are rapidly drifting into china’s orbit of influence. meanwhile, democracy in afghanistan has been in crisis, with the taliban continuing to rise in power and influence—a development that sets back decades of indian investment and diplomacy. the only country that still has a reasonably cordial relationship with india remains bhutan, but even this friendliness stems mostly from the tiny himalayan country’s bid to gain support in its border dispute with china.

the question then is how a policy welcomed by most of india’s neighbors unraveled so completely since 2014. after all, modi actually devoted—at least at the start of his first term—a considerable amount of time, attention, and energy to regional foreign-policy issues. he undertook a spate of visits to international capitals and made much of his personal rapport with a variety of national leaders.

with the possible exception of relations with pakistan, one can trace the collapse of this well-meaning and ambitious policy to several failures on the part of the modi government. flawed choices at critical moments eroded regional trust in new delhi. for example, in the wake of a devastating earthquake in nepal in april 2015, india acted with considerable speed in sending critical aid—efforts that generated much warmth and goodwill. those sentiments, however, would not last long. later the same year, nepal was on the verge of adopting a new constitution. kathmandu faced a degree of domestic opposition, especially from an ethnic group known as madhesis, who straddle the nepal-india border. they believed, with some justification, that their interests were not adequately represented in the new constitution. since some ethnic madhesis also live in northern india, modi’s government imposed an informal blockade on landlocked nepal in an attempt to court their votes. the consequences of the blockade were disastrous for the nepalese economy: for example, the price of rice doubled, and a cylinder of cooking gas became at least five times as expensive due to a severe drop in supplies. not surprisingly, the reservoir of goodwill for india that its disaster assistance had generated quickly evaporated. meanwhile, china took this golden opportunity to step into the breach, setting the stage for nepal to reduce its dependency on india in the future.

modi’s stance toward other small but significant neighbors has also frittered away the early gains from his first term in office. for example, in 2015, new delhi successfully concluded a land boundary agreement with bangladesh, ending a contentious issue in bilateral relations that had existed since the creation of east pakistan—now bangladesh—in 1947. yet again, the positive impacts would not last. in 2019, the modi government set in motion its national register of citizens, a massive exercise in the northeastern border state of assam designed to verify the citizenship of its inhabitants. the government was embarking on this project because it had made illegal immigration from bangladesh a key campaign issue in the 2019 national election. to be sure, the matter of illegal immigration is a legitimate concern for india, but the modi government used it mostly as a political cudgel to instill fear among india’s muslim minority and to expel anyone who could not produce the requisite documents. bangladesh, which could be forced to accept many deportees, strongly objected to the national register of citizens. not surprisingly, relations with india have since become frosty. this amounts to a real missed opportunity given that bangladesh’s economy was thriving until the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. and once again, in the wake of the ongoing health care crisis, china has stepped in with much-needed medical supplies for bangladesh.six years on from modi’s “neighborhood first” promises, there have been very few real advances.

india has also lost considerable ground in sri lanka. the modi government wholeheartedly backed the government of maithripala sirisena, but with strongman gotabaya rajapaksa’s electoral victory in november 2019, new delhi suddenly found itself on the backfoot—the rajapaksa brothers, after all, have long built closer ties to beijing. once again, india seems to have missed its chance: it could have positioned itself more strongly as an infrastructural investor in the country.

finally, relations with arch-enemy pakistan have plummeted dramatically. on this front, in all fairness, the modi government only shares a degree of blame. modi’s initial overture to pakistan in 2014 was met with little reciprocity. on the contrary, at least two major terrorist attacks—which could be traced to pakistan—took place in 2016 and again in 2019. the second, on a paramilitary convoy along the india-pakistan border, led to a spiral of conflict culminating in india’s first use of airpower across the so-called line of control since the 1971 war. but while tensions eventually cooled, new delhi’s rushed move in august 2019 to revoke the special status of the disputed state of jammu and kashmir led to a dramatic deterioration in india-pakistan ties. pakistan withdrew its ambassador from new delhi and expelled his counterpart from islamabad. pakistan suspended trade ties with india. and prime minister imran khan took the opportunity to criticize india on a global stage at the united nations and in the opinion pages of western newspapers. while the success of those moves was limited, ties have not recovered since. and once again, china has taken advantage. beijing has made substantial investments in pakistan as part of its china-pakistan economic corridor, including new roads, power plants, and the deep sea port of gwadar on the arabian sea.

six years on from modi’s “neighborhood first” promises, there have been very few real advances—and relations with most neighbors have worsened. as a result, new delhi has missed out on several potential gains: trade and investment could have expanded, and countries could have united around common regional problems such as environmental degradation and food and water security. each of these developments, in concert, could have also limited china’s long march into the region. there is little question that modi’s initial move to try to boost relations with india’s neighbors was both commendable and timely; it represented a clear shift from the failed policies of previous governments. but a failure to follow through with a sustained strategy has left india worse off than before it conceived of a grand, flashy slogan for its neighbors, each of whom seems to now be following what we can now call a china-first policy."
Police: 2 women hit by car on Seattle highway amid protest,48,hlaf18,https://apnews.com/741b01da9ce010717df1afca30afe09e,16,1593924523.0,,"emergency workers tend to an injured person on the ground after a driver sped through a protest-related closure on the interstate 5 freeway in seattle, authorities said early saturday, july 4, 2020. dawit kelete, 27, has been arrested and booked on two counts of vehicular assault.

emergency workers tend to an injured person on the ground after a driver sped through a protest-related closure on the interstate 5 freeway in seattle, authorities said early saturday, july 4, 2020. dawit kelete, 27, has been arrested and booked on two counts of vehicular assault. (james anderson via ap)

seattle (ap) — a 27-year-old man drove a car onto a closed freeway in seattle early saturday and barreled through a panicked crowd of protesters, critically injuring two women, officials said.

dawit kelete of seattle drove the car around vehicles that were blocking interstate 5 and sped into the crowd about 1:40 a.m., according to a police report released by the washington state patrol. video taken at the scene by protesters showed people shouting “car! car!” before fleeing the roadway.

summer taylor, 24, of seattle, was in critical condition while diaz love, 32, of portland, oregon, was upgraded to serious condition in the intensive care unit, harborview medical center spokeswoman susan gregg said.

love was filming the protest in a nearly two-hour-long facebook livestream captioned “black femme march takes i-5” when the video ended abruptly; with about 15 seconds left, shouts of “car!” can be heard as the camera starts to shake before screeching tires and the sound of impact are heard.

a graphic video posted on social media showed the white jaguar racing toward a group of protesters who are standing behind several parked cars, set up for protection. the car swerves around the other vehicles and slams into the two women, sending them flying into the air.

the driver, who was alone, fled the scene after hitting the protesters, trooper chase van cleave told the associated press. one of the protesters got in a car and chased the driver for about a mile. he was able to stop him by pulling his car in front of the jaguar, van cleave said.

troopers arrived, and the driver was put in custody, washington state patrol capt. ron mead said.

kelete was described by offices as reserved and sullen when he was arrested, according to court documents. he also asked if the pedestrians were ok, the documents say.

kelete was booked into the king county correctional facility on saturday morning on two counts of vehicular assault. bail was denied.

a judge found probable cause to hold kelete on an investigation of vehicular assault. he faces a second court hearing on monday at which the judge will determine if he can be released on bail, according to court documents.

it was not immediately clear if kelete had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

officials were trying to determine the motive as well as where he got onto the interstate, which had been closed by the state patrol for more than an hour before the women were hit. mead said they suspect kelete drove the wrong way on a ramp. trooper rick johnson said the driver went through a barrier that closed the freeway before striking the women.

troopers did not know whether it was a targeted attack, but impairment was not considered a factor, mead said.

kelete has a seattle address. he is listed in public records as a student who attended washington state university between 2011 and 2017 majoring in business and commerce. his enrollment status could not be confirmed because the university was closed saturday.

the washington state patrol said sunday evening that going forward it won’t allow protesters to enter i-5 and would arrest pedestrians on the freeway.

seattle has been the site of prolonged unrest following the may 25 police killing of george floyd in minneapolis, which sparked nationwide protests. dozens of people were arrested this past week in connection with protests as demonstrations continue after authorities cleared the “capitol hill occupied protest” zone wednesday morning.

protesters had shut down the interstate for 19 days in a row, mead said at a press conference.

the state patrol responded by closing sections of the interstate to keep drivers and protesters safe.

“in a time that requires care and flexibility, we are exercising the safest means possible to avoid injuries or worse to motorists, protesters, wsdot personnel and our troopers by closing the roadway and separating protesters from vehicular traffic,” chief john batiste said in a statement on june 27, responding to complaints about the road closures.

mead emphasized that the freeway is “simply not a safe place” for pedestrians, and said he hoped protesters would cease what he termed “unlawful behavior” in blocking the interstate.

“my hope is, as a result of this tragedy, protesters will reconsider their desire to be on the interstate because i cannot guarantee their safety, plain and simple,” mead said.

seattle mayor jenny durkan said the city stands beside the friends and family of the victims.

“no one should risk their life for demanding better from our city, state and country,” durkan said on twitter.

protesters were on the freeway for more than an hour before the car drove around the blockade around 1:36 a.m., mead said.

the state patrol tweeted out two pictures of the driver’s car with significant damage to its bumper and windshield.

seattle police tweeted that they were assisting."
"China Suppression Of Uighur Minorities Meets U.N. Definition Of Genocide, Report Says",383,hlnh4l,https://www.npr.org/2020/07/04/887239225/china-suppression-of-uighur-minorities-meets-u-n-definition-of-genocide-report-s,52,1593987993.0,,"china suppression of uighur minorities meets u.n. definition of genocide, report says

scott simon, host:

a new report in foreign policy says that china's suppression of uighurs, kazakhs and other chiefly muslim ethnic minorities in northwest china now meets the united nations definition of genocide, mass sterilization, forced abortions and mandatory birth control part of a campaign that has swept up more than 1.5 million people and what researcher adrian zenz calls probably the largest incarceration of an ethnoreligious minority since the holocaust. adrian zenz joins us from minneapolis. mr. zenz, thanks so much for being with us.

adrian zenz: thank you.

simon: those words are stunning. outline for us, if you can, what you found.

zenz: i was able to uncover dedicated policies by beijing in the region to systematically suppress birthrates and depress population growth. i uncovered evidence that the uighurs are subject to internment in camps if they violate birth control policies, have too many children. i also uncovered that there's tools to implement intrauterine contraceptive devices and other intrusive surgical birth prevention mechanisms in at least 80% of the targeted women.

simon: eighty percent.

zenz: that's the minimum goal for 2019, but i personally believe that the actual was closer probably to 90%.

simon: it is notoriously difficult to do research on the chinese government, and specifically their policies on the uighur population. how did you conduct the research? do you trust the data?

zenz: i do trust the data, which, as before, comes from different types of chinese government documents, firstly from the xinjiang national health commission, whose website has subsequently gone offline since the publication of my report, from local prefecture government websites and from county websites. we're talking budgets with very detailed target indicator figures, reports, policy documents.

simon: people need to be careful using the word genocide. why do you think it's justified and important to use it now?

zenz: i have long argued that the atrocity in the region is a cultural genocide, not a literal genocide. i do continue to believe that, generally speaking, the chinese government does not intend to physically eradicate the uighurs and kazakhs, just to integrate, subjugate, dominate and assimilate them. however, this is coupled with a policy of ethnoracial domination, as the government has brought millions of han chinese settler in the regions with promises of high salaries, jobs and free housing.

the reason why now this has changed - we do need to probably call it a genocide - is quite simply because the evidence now, for the first time, very specifically meets one of the five criteria set forth by the united nations convention for the punishment and prevention of the crime of genocide from 1948, which specifically says the suppression of birth.

simon: the u.n. has said that up to 1.5 million uighurs are in internment camps in china. china says this is to contain the threat of terrorism and to reeducate people in the camps to become better chinese citizens. behind those statistics are real human lives that have been upended. i wonder what some of the stories you've been able to discover have reached into you the most.

zenz: stories that are among the most harrowing, of course, are stories of abuse, stories of women being caught up by the police and, as they're being brought to the internment camp, the first thing is that they're told, you're going to go on the surgery table, and we're going to put an intrauterine contraceptive device into your body, because that's standard policy for women who are put into a camp. other women report of forced sterilization, of abuse, even accounts of rape.

simon: a word like genocide is also supposed to provoke the world to act. what do you believe should or can be done, mr. zenz?

zenz: i think china needs to face consequences by exclusion or sanctioning from multilateral institutions, either political or possibly economic sanctions, given that we also have a situation of forced labor. i think the international community got to start to think real hard how, with what kind of actions it's going to back up its professed and supposed moral values.

simon: adrian zenz is a senior fellow in china studies at the victims of communism memorial foundation. mr. zenz, thanks so much for being with us.

zenz: thank you.

Predominantly Black armed protesters march through Confederate memorial park in Georgia,28,hlp04m,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-usa-stone-mountain/predominantly-black-armed-protesters-march-through-confederate-memorial-park-in-georgia-idUSKBN24605G,9,1593993800.0,[deleted],"(reuters) - a predominantly black group of heavily armed protesters marched through stone mountain park near atlanta on saturday, calling for removal of the giant confederate rock carving at the site that civil rights activists consider a monument to racism.

file photo: a man speaks into a bullhorn while pointing at the confederate monument carved into granite on stone mountain while protesting the monument at stone mountain park in stone mountain, georgia, u.s. june 16, 2020. reuters/dustin chambers

video footage of the independence day rally posted on social media showed scores of demonstrators dressed in black - many in paramilitary-style clothing and all wearing face scarves - quietly parading several abreast down a sidewalk at the park.

many of the protesters carried rifles, including military-type weapons, and some wore ammunition belts slung over their shoulders. although african americans appeared to account for the vast majority of the marchers, protesters of various races, men and women alike, were among the group.

one video clip showed a leader of the demonstrators, who was not identified, shouting into a loudspeaker in a challenge to white supremacists who historically have used stone mountain as a rallying spot of their own.

“i don’t see no white militia,” he declared. “we’re here. where ... you at? we’re in your house. let’s go.”

john bankhead, a spokesman for the stone mountain memorial association, said the protesters were peaceful and orderly.

“it’s a public park, a state park. we have these protests on both sides of the issue from time to time. we respect people’s first amendment right,” bankhead told nbc affiliate station wxia-tv.

“we understand the sensitivities of the issue here at the park ... so we respect that and allow them to come in as long as it’s peaceful, which it has been.”

stone mountain, which reopened for the holiday weekend following a weeks-long closure over the coronavirus, has faced renewed calls for its removal since the may 25 death of george floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of minneapolis police.

floyd’s killing helped revive a long-simmering conflict between groups seeking to do away with confederate statues and sculptures, which they see as pro-slavery symbols, and those who believe they honor the traditions and history of the deep south.

nine stories high and spanning the length of a football field, the bas-relief stone mountain sculpture carved into a granite wall overlooking the georgia countryside some 25 miles (40 km) east of atlanta remains the largest such monument to america’s civil war confederacy.

it features the likenesses of jefferson davis, who was president of the 11-state confederacy, and two of his legendary generals, robert e. lee and thomas “stonewall” jackson.

stone mountain has long held symbolism for white supremacists. the ku klux klan, a hate group that was formed by confederate army veterans and has a history of lynchings and terror against black people, held its rebirth ceremony atop mountain in 1915 with flaming crosses. klansmen still hold occasional gatherings in the shadows of the edifice, albeit now met with protesters behind police tape. many of those cross-burnings took place on or around july 4."

(ap photo/john hanna)

topeka, kan. (ap) — a weekly kansas newspaper whose publisher is a county republican party chairman posted a cartoon on its facebook page likening the democratic governor’s order requiring people to wear masks in public to the roundup and murder of millions of jews during the holocaust.

the cartoon on the anderson county review’s facebook page depicts gov. laura kelly wearing a mask with a jewish star of david on it, next to a drawing of people being loaded onto train cars. its caption is, “lockdown laura says: put on your mask ... and step onto the cattle car.”

the newspaper posted the cartoon on friday, the day that kelly’s mask order aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus took effect. it’s drawn several hundred comments, many of them strongly critical. dane hicks, the paper’s owner and publisher, said in an email to the associated press that he plans to publish the cartoon in the newspaper’s next edition thursday.

kelly, who is catholic, issued a statement saying, “mr. hicks’ decision to publish anti-semitic imagery is deeply offensive and he should remove it immediately.”

but hicks said in an email that political cartoons are “gross over-caricatures designed to provoke debate” and “fodder for the marketplace of ideas.”

“the topic here is the governmental overreach which has been the hallmark of governor kelly’s administration,” he said.

as for the cartoon’s reference to the holocaust, hicks said critics of president donald trump have compared him to adolf hitler, and, “i certainly have more evidence of that kind of totalitarianism in kelly’s actions, in an editorial cartoon sort of way, than trump’s critics do, yet they persist in it daily.”

hicks’ newspaper is based in the anderson county seat of garnett, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) southwest of kansas city and has a circulation of about 2,100, according to the kansas press association.

hicks also is anderson county’s gop chairman. kansas republican party chairman michael kuckelman said in a text that posting the cartoon is “inappropriate.”

but kuckelman, also an attorney, added, “it is on the newspaper facebook page and media has wide berth with (the) first amendment (to the u.s. constitution, guaranteeing freedom of speech and the press).

critics of the cartoon demanded that republican party and gop legislative leaders to repudiate the cartoon and hicks.

kansas senate minority leader anthony hensley, a topeka democrat, called the cartoon “appalling” and disgusting.” kansas house minority leader tom sawyer, a wichita democrat, said the cartoon’s rhetoric is “irresponsible” and “dangerous.”

rabbi moti rieber, executive director of kansas interfaith action, said most if not all comparisons of current political events to the holocaust are “odious” and said it’s “incoherent” to equate an action designed to save lives with mass murder. finally, he said, putting the star of david on kelly’s mask is anti-semitic because it implies “nefarious jews” are behind her actions.

“this thing is like the trifecta of garbage,” rieber said.

hicks said that if holocaust survivors, their relatives or other jews are offended, he would apologize to them because he means “no slight to them.”

“then again, they better than anyone should appreciate the harbingers of governmental overreach and the present but tender seedlings of tyranny,” he added.

hicks also derided some of his social media critics as “liberal marxist parasites,” adding, “as a traditional american, they are my enemy.”

some republicans have criticized kelly’s order as infringing on personal liberties, though kansas law allows counties to opt out and anderson county has done so.

the governor issued the order because of resurgence in reported coronavirus cases that increased the state’s total to nearly 16,000 as of friday, when kansas finished its worst two-week spike since the pandemic began. the state has reported 277 covid-19-related deaths. the number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.

hicks previously criticized kelly in a blog post for taking a “one-size-fits-all approach to reopening what he called the state’s “bureaucracy-hammered” economy.

kelly lifted statewide restrictions on businesses and public gatherings on may 26 after weeks of criticism from the republican-controlled legislature that she was moving too slowly to reopen the state’s economy. some conservative gop lawmakers also have accused her of being heavy-handed and even dictatorial in responding to the pandemic.

anderson county, with about 7,900 residents, is part of a conservative swath of eastern kansas. registered republicans outnumber democrats 2-to-1 and trump carried it with nearly 73% of the vote in 2016.

the state health department has reported only four coronavirus cases for anderson county, all of them since may 8. there have been no reported deaths there.

county commission chairman jerry howarter said of the more than 70 people who showed up to its meeting on the mask mandate friday, all but one opposed it. he said he had not seen the cartoon.

as mask-wearing becomes a political flashpoint—despite coronavirus cases spiking to record levels across the country—new research from goldman sachs suggests a national mask mandate would slow the growth rate of new coronavirus infections and prevent a 5% gdp loss caused by additional lockdown measures.

key facts

goldman’s analysts found that wearing face coverings has a significant impact on coronavirus outcomes, and they suggest that a federal mask mandate would “meaningfully” increase mask usage across the country, especially in states like florida and texas, where masks are not currently required. the researchers estimate that a national mandate would increase the portion of people wearing masks by 15 percentage points, and cut the daily growth of new cases by 1.0 percentage point to 0.6%. reducing the spread of the virus through mask-wearing, the analysts found, could be a substitute for strict lockdown measures that would otherwise shave 5%—or $1 trillion—off the u.s. gdp.

crucial quote

“if a face mask mandate meaningfully lowers coronavirus infections, it could be valuable not only from a public health perspective but also from an economic perspective because it could substitute for renewed lockdowns that would otherwise hit gdp,” the researchers wrote.

key background

as coronavirus cases rise to record levels, prompting some states to pause or walk back their reopening plans, many lawmakers have called for a national mask mandate. presumptive presidential nominee joe biden said that if he’s elected, he would use federal power to require all americans to wear masks in public places. house speaker nancy pelosi has also voiced her support for the practice: “real men wear masks,” she said earlier this month. new york gov. andrew cuomo has also called for an executive order mandating that everyone wear masks in public, suggesting that president trump—who has downplayed the importance of masks and dismissed suggestions that he wear one—should lead by example.

Putin Mocks U.S. Embassy Rainbow Flag - The Moscow Times,14,hly9t3,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/07/03/putin-mocks-us-embassy-rainbow-flag-a70782,5,1594027057.0,,"during a televised video conference, a lawmaker told putin that the u.s. embassy had hung a rainbow flag on its facade for the first time to celebrate pride month in june.

russian president vladimir putin on friday mocked a rainbow lgbt pride flag hung from the u.s. embassy in moscow, suggesting it reflected on the orientation of the diplomats.

""who works in this building?"" putin asked the speaker, senator alexei pushkov, to be told ""americans.""

""let them celebrate. they've shown a certain something about the people who work there,"" he added with a smile.

putin on friday signed amendments to the constitution backed by a national vote that include a clause on marriage being between a man and a woman, aimed at preventing legalization of gay unions.

the president said friday however that russia does not discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation.

he said a law banning promotion of homosexual relationships to minors, which he signed in 2013 to a storm of international condemnation aimed simply to prevent the ""foisting"" of such relationships on children.

the law has been used as a pretext to ban gay pride events.

""let a person grow up, become an adult and decide his own path himself. you just shouldn't impose anything,"" putin insisted.

he said that ""those who attack us on this basis are just trying to break down an open door.""

a conservative politician who heads the union of women of russia warned putin that billboards were using rainbow imagery to sell ice-cream.

""it's indirect but all the same it forces our children to get used to the colours, to the flag that everyone is hanging up, even on that embassy,"" said yekaterina lakhova."
Former high profile UN aid official Peter John Dalglish jailed for child abuse in Nepal,24,hm7yu1,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/former-high-profile-un-aid-official-peter-john-dalglish-jailed-for-child-abuse-in,4,1594072113.0,,"kathmandu (afp) - a former un official has been jailed for sexually abusing children in nepal, officials said on tuesday (july 9), following a trial underscoring the country's growing appeal for foreign paedophiles.

peter john dalglish, 62, from canada, a former high-profile humanitarian worker, was sentenced on monday to terms of nine and seven years in two cases after being convicted last month.

thakur trital, a district court official, told afp that dalglish had been sentenced for nine years for abusing a 12-year-old boy, and seven years' jail for molesting another 14-year-old.

""the judge is yet to decide whether he should serve a total of 16 years in jail or be released after nine years. in most cases of a similar nature, sentences get overlapped, but it is upon the judge to decide,"" trital said.

dalglish has also been told to pay compensation of 500,000 nepali rupees (s$6,170) to each of the victims.

dalglish was arrested in april last year in kavrepalanchowk district, near kathmandu, by nepal's central bureau of investigation.

the two boys were at the house where police nabbed dalglish, investigators said.

dalglish has denied the charges.

the aid worker, who in 2016 was awarded the order of canada - the country's second-highest civilian honour - made his name as a humanitarian worker advocating for street children, child labourers and those affected by war.

he co-founded street kids international in the 1980s which merged with save the children.

in the last decade, dalglish held key positions in un agencies, including as chief for un habitat in afghanistan in 2015.

in nepal, dalglish was an adviser in a child programme for the international labour organisation in the early 2000s.

weak law enforcement has made nepal notorious for sexual predators, with several arrests and convictions in recent years.

in 2015, a canadian orphanage volunteer, ernest macintosh, 71, was sentenced to seven years in prison for sexually abusing a disabled 15-year-old boy, while in 2010, french charity worker jean-jacques haye was convicted of raping 10 children at a kathmandu orphanage."
Supreme Court rules 'faithless electors' can't go rogue at Electoral College,45,hm8nfw,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rules-faithless-electors-can-t-go-rogue-electoral-n1231394,8,1594074569.0,,"washington — the 538 people who cast the actual votes for president in december as part of the electoral college are not free agents and must vote as the laws of their states direct, the supreme court ruled monday.

the unanimous decision in the ""faithless elector"" case was a defeat for advocates of changing the electoral college, who hoped a win would force a shift in the method of electing presidents toward a nationwide popular vote. but it was a win for state election officials who feared that empowering rogue electors would cause chaos.

writing for the court, justice elena kagan said the constitution gives states far-reaching authority over choosing presidential electors. that includes the power to set conditions on an elector's appointment, ""that is to say, what the elector must do for the appointment to take effect.""

what's more, she wrote, ""nothing in the constitution expressly prohibits states from taking away president electors' voting discretion."" the ruling aligns with ""the trust of a nation that here, we the people rule,"" kagan said.

the november general election is not actually a direct vote for the presidential candidates. voters instead choose a slate of electors appointed in their states by the political parties. those electors meet in december to cast their ballots, which are counted during a joint session of congress in january.

the court's opinion said presidential electors must act as their states require, which in most of the nation means voting for the candidate who won the popular vote in their states. in maine and nebraska, presidential electors are guided by the votes of congressional districts.

if the court had ruled the other way, then individual electors who decided to vote as they wished in a close race could potentially have the power decide who wins.

four ""faithless electors"" from colorado and washington state who did not conform to the popular vote in the 2016 election sued, claiming that states can regulate only how electors are chosen, not what comes later.

harvard law professor larry lessig, who advocates electoral college reform, told the court that nothing in the constitution gives states any authority to restrict how an elector can vote, because they act in a federal role when meeting as the electoral college.

instead of voting for hillary clinton, who won the popular vote in colorado, micheal baca cast his vote for john kasich, the former republican governor of ohio. and in washington state, where clinton also won the popular vote, three of the state's 12 electors voted for colin powell, the former secretary of state.

lessig said on monday that he was pleased with the timing of the court's decision, but not the result.

""when we launched these cases, we did it because, regardless of the outcome, it was critical to resolve this question before it created a constitutional crisis. we have achieved that,"" he said. ""obviously, we don't believe the court has interpreted the constitution correctly. but we are happy that we have achieved our primary objective: this uncertainty has been removed. that is progress.""

the supreme court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the results of the popular vote. but the justices had never before said whether it is constitutional to enforce those pledges.

lessig said he hoped the controversy would encourage more states to adopt a system in which they would assign all of their electors to the candidate who wins the nationwide popular vote for president.

more than a dozen states have signed an interstate agreement to make the change. it would take effect once the participating states represent at least 270 electoral votes, the minimum needed to be elected president."

updated at 5:40 p.m. et

the u.s. supreme court has unanimously upheld laws across the country that remove or punish rogue electoral college delegates who refuse to cast their votes for the presidential candidate they were pledged to support.

the decision monday was a loss for ""faithless electors,"" who argued that under the constitution they have discretion to decide which candidate to support.

writing for the court, justice elena kagan, in a decision peppered with references to the broadway show hamilton and the tv show veep, said electoral college delegates have ""no ground for reversing"" the statewide popular vote. that, she said, ""accords with the constitution — as well as with the trust of the nation that here, we the people rule.""

the decision was a relief to election law experts as well as democratic and republican party officials, who have long supported faithless elector laws such as those upheld monday.

if the case had gone the other way, it would have been a ""nightmare scenario"" in which people unhappy with the general election results could ""go after electors and try to threaten them or cajole them or bribe them to vote in a particular way,"" said richard hasen, an election law expert at the university of california, irvine.

colorado attorney general phil weiser echoed those sentiments: ""this was one where i did not want to contemplate what the other consequence would have looked like,"" he said.

even harvard law school professor lawrence lessig, who represented the rogue electors before the supreme court, appeared only mildly disappointed at the loss. ""we took this case initially because we just thought this needed to be resolved before it created a constitutional crisis,"" he said.

thirty-two states have some sort of faithless elector law, but only 15 of those remove, penalize or simply cancel the votes of the errant electors. the 15 are michigan, colorado, utah, arizona, indiana, minnesota, montana, nebraska, nevada, washington, california, new mexico, south carolina, oklahoma and north carolina. although maine has no such law, the secretary of state has said it has determined a faithless elector can be removed.

monday's supreme court decision, however, is so strong that it would seem to allow states to remove faithless electors even without a state law. duke university school of law professor guy-uriel charles said that nonetheless, it would be prudent for states to pass laws to prevent electors from going rogue.

""states certainly would be better off by imposing some statutory basis ... for removing or sanctioning rogue electors,"" charles said, adding, ""but i don't see anything in this opinion that requires them to do so.""

monday's case began after the 2016 election when a handful of electoral college delegates pledged to democratic nominee hillary clinton in colorado and washington state voted for other individuals, such as colin powell or john kasich.

as michael baca, the faithless elector from colorado, put it in an npr interview, the idea was to ""reach across the aisle"" to republican electors in 2016 and try to find a candidate that some republican delegates would be willing to support other than donald trump.

baca was removed on the spot under colorado's faithless elector law, and the washington state delegates were fined $1,000 each. in 2019, washington's law was amended to require that faithless electors be removed as well.

on monday, the supreme court put its stamp of approval on either approach, at minimum.

kagan's opinion noted that the original electoral college system created by the framers of the constitution failed to anticipate the growth of political parties. by 1796, the first contested election after george washington's retirement, the system exploded in disarray, with two consecutive electoral college ""fiascos.""

that led to passage of the 12th amendment in 1804, ""facilitating the electoral college ... as a mechanism not for deliberation but for party line voting,"" kagan wrote.

nothing in the constitution prevents the states from ""taking away presidential electors' voting discretion,"" she said. for centuries, almost all electors have considered themselves bound to vote for the winner of the state popular vote. if the framers of the constitution had a different idea, she said, they never committed it to the printed page.

justice clarence thomas, joined in part by justice neil gorsuch, agreed with the outcome but wrote separately to explain his different reasoning.

rather than interpret the constitution's sparse language about the electoral college as authorizing states to impose conditions on electors, thomas argued that power is reserved to the states by the 10th amendment.

although many americans think that they elect the president and vice president, in fact, it is the electoral college, an arcane intermediary mechanism dreamed up by the founders, that formally determines who wins the election.

the system has been considered a formality because usually the winner of the popular vote also wins the electoral college.

but twice in the past two decades, the unexpected took place: the winner of the popular vote did not become president; instead, the winner in the electoral college prevailed. trump, who got nearly 3 million fewer votes overall than clinton, won the state-by-state allotment of electoral college votes in 2016 and became president. and in 2000, george w. bush became president, winning five more electoral college votes than al gore, though gore won roughly half a million more popular votes.

in total, the popular vote winners have failed to win the electoral college vote on four occasions, the first two occurring during the 1800s.

but the fact that the last two occurred in just the past 20 years has provoked various suggestions for reform, including getting rid of the electoral college altogether. with the country as polarized as it is, however, that seems unlikely, as it would require a constitutional amendment, and that in turn requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of congress, and approval by three-quarters of the states.

several states have signed on to a proposal to sidestep the electoral college altogether by joining a ""national popular vote interstate compact"" to pledge their electoral college votes to whichever candidate wins the national popular vote, regardless of how the candidates perform in their state. so far, the compact has the support of 15 states and the district of columbia, making up 196 electoral votes of the 270 needed to win the white house.

that scheme, which would only go into effect once enough states have joined to tip the election, would surely be challenged in court as well.

flawed as the electoral college system may be, at the oral arguments in may, the justices expressed concern about tinkering with laws that bind the delegates to vote for the popular vote winner in their states.

justice samuel alito observed that if the popular vote is close, the possibility of ""changing just a few votes"" in the electoral college would rationally ""prompt the losing party ... to launch a massive campaign to try to influence electors, and there would be a long period of uncertainty about who the next president was going to be.""

similarly, justice brett kavanaugh alluded to what he called ""the chaos principle of judging, which suggests that if it's a close call ... we shouldn't facilitate or create chaos.""

none of those concerns surfaced explicitly in kagan's majority opinion. she instead pointed to the text of the constitution as well as more than 200 years of history and tradition to make her case.

""the constitution's text and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee — and the state voters' choice — for president,"" kagan wrote.

""... the electors' constitutional claim has neither text nor history on its side."""

White House defends Trump's claim that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are 'harmless' with chart showing 5 percent are fatal,125,hmhvvu,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-99-percent-coronavirus-cases-totally-harmless-claim-mcenany-white-house-191725001.html,29,1594102743.0,[deleted],"white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany came to her press briefing on monday prepared to defend president trump’s claim over the weekend that “99 percent” of u.s. coronavirus cases are “totally harmless” with two charts illustrating the country’s covid-19 death rate.

but mcenany’s slides showed a case fatality rate — the percentage of confirmed cases that result in death — of 4.6 percent, not the 1 percent implied by trump.

during a july 4 “salute to america” speech on the south lawn of the white house, trump boasted that the administration has conducted more than 40 million coronavirus tests.

“but by so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless,” trump added.

asked about the remark during monday’s briefing, mcenany said the president was merely pointing to “a factual statement, one that is rooted in science,” before calling for the charts to be displayed.

the first showed the u.s. case fatality rate, or cfr, dipping to 4.6 percent after topping 6 percent in may; the second compared it to those of european countries — like france, italy and the united kingdom — where the rate is upwards of 10 percent. both charts cited the european cdc as their source, and both showed the u.s. death rate from the coronavirus more than four times the rate trump’s remark suggested.

“what that speaks to is the great work of this administration,” mcenany said. “and that’s what the president was pointing out.”

even though a substantial number of coronavirus infections do not cause illness — the exact number is uncertain — covid-19 isn’t “harmless” to many people who contract it, even if they survive. the acute phase can be debilitating, and a growing number of reports indicate the potential for long-term damage to the lungs, other organs and circulatory system.

mcenany wasn’t the only member of the white house who appeared to struggle to defend trump’s false claim. dr. stephen hahn, the fda commissioner and white house coronavirus task force member, repeatedly dodged questions about the remark in television interviews on sunday.

after mcenany’s display, nbc’s peter alexander asked the press secretary to clarify whether trump was using “harmless” as a synonym for nonfatal.

“the president was noting the fact that the vast majority of americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this,” mcenany replied. “of course he takes this very seriously. of course no one wants to see anyone in this country contract covid, which is why the administration has fought hard to make sure that’s not the case with our historic response effort.”

according to johns hopkins university, there have been more than 2.9 million confirmed covid-19 cases in the united states and over 130,000 deaths.

U.S. says foreign students may have to leave if their school goes online-only,201,hmk5k2,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/ice-tells-foreign-students-leave-u-s-if-their-school-n1233026?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma,43,1594110644.0,,"washington — the government announced monday that international students will not be allowed to stay in the country if the institution in which they're enrolled is holding online-only courses this fall, and those failing to comply with the rules will risk deportation.

students on f-1 and m-1 visas who face such a situation ""must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status,"" the immigration and customs enforcement agency said in a news release.

those who violate the rules ""may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings,"" the agency said.

the news comes as some colleges and universities, including harvard, have announced they plan to hold online-only courses this fall as the united states struggles to get the coronavirus pandemic under control.

the new rules are a blow to many international students who will be forced to either leave the country or scramble to transfer to a new school to keep their legal status. some who exit the country will face hurdles to learning online, such as varying time zones.

the agency's guidance stated that students in institutions with a hybrid of online and in-person courses may take multiple online classes, while current limits will remain for colleges and universities holding normal in-person classes.

the new rules ""should not affect students participating in opt,"" an agency spokesperson said, referring to the optional practical training program that allows f-1 students who have finished their study to work in the u.s. for up to one year in a relevant field.

international students are 5.5 percent of the higher education population in the u.s., totaling nearly 1.1 million in the 2018-2019 academic year, according to the institute of international education.

because they generally receive little or no financial aid, foreign students tend to pour large amounts of money into u.s. higher education institutions, which subsidizes americans.

the new regulations represent the latest in a series of moves by the trump administration to restrict legal immigration and visas during the covid-19 pandemic.

the agency's rules require schools to ""update their information in the student and exchange visitor information system (sevis) within 10 days of the change if they begin the fall semester with in-person classes but are later required to switch to only online classes, or a nonimmigrant student changes their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an entirely online course load."""

georgia gov. brian kemp is activating up to 1,000 national guard troops after a spate of shootings and protests in atlanta over the weekend. five people died, including an 8-year-old girl, and at least 30 people were injured. the republican governor issued an executive order monday that would send the national guard to protect the state capitol, the governor's mansion and the department of public safety's headquarters, where close to 100 demonstrators set fire to part of the building early sunday morning.

in the order, kemp slammed atlanta officials who ""have failed to quell ongoing violence"" over an especially turbulent few months that have seen the resignation of the police chief, increased sickouts of officers and two officers charged in connection with the killing of a black man.

""peaceful protests were hijacked by criminals with a dangerous, destructive agenda,"" kemp said. ""now, innocent georgians are being targeted, shot and left for dead. ... enough with the tough talk — we must protect the lives and livelihoods of all georgians.""

the atlanta police department is offering a reward in the killing of 8-year-old secoriea turner, who was shot saturday night near the wendy's where rayshard brooks was killed by a white police officer on june 12. sunday evening, a visibly frustrated atlanta mayor keisha lance bottoms decried the violence that rocked the city over the fourth of july weekend, asking for information about a group of armed individuals who blocked the road before firing into the car and striking secoriea.

""enough is enough,"" bottoms said. ""we have talked about this movement that is happening across america at this moment in time when we have the ears and the interest of people across this country and across this globe who are saying they want to see change.""

less than 24 hours later, a 53-year-old man was also killed near where secoriea died.

bottoms, who is considered to be a contender as former vice president joe biden's running mate in this year's presidential election, received praise for her earlier handling of protests following the death of george floyd but now faces criticism for the increase in crime.

on monday, atlanta police erected concrete barriers around the burned-out restaurant and cleared out protesters and items left at a makeshift memorial."

rio de janeiro (ap) — brazil’s president jair bolsonaro said tuesday he has tested positive for the new coronavirus after months of downplaying its severity while deaths mounted rapidly inside the country.

the 65-year-old right-wing populist who has been known to mingle in crowds without covering his face confirmed the results while wearing a mask and speaking to reporters huddled close in front of him in the capital, brasilia.

he said he is taking hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug that he, like president donald trump, has been promoting even though it has not been proven effective against covid-19.

“i’m, well, normal. i even want to take a walk around here, but i can’t due to medical recommendations,” bolsonaro said. “i thought i had it before, given my very dynamic activity. i’m president and on the combat lines. i like to be in the middle of the people.”

brazil, the world’s sixth-biggest nation, with more than 210 million people, is one of the outbreak’s most lethal hot spots. more than 65,000 brazilians have died from covid-19, and over 1.5 million have been infected.

both numbers are the world’s second-highest totals, behind those of the u.s., though the true figures are believed to be higher because of a lack of widespread testing. on tuesday alone, 1,254 deaths were confirmed.

other world leaders who have had bouts with covid-19 include british prime minister boris johnson, britain’s prince charles, prince albert ii of monaco and honduran president juan orlando hernández.

bolsonaro is “the democratic leader who has most denied the seriousness of this pandemic,” said maurício santoro, a political science professor at the state university of rio de janeiro. “him getting infected is a blow to his credibility. it will be seen as another example of the failure of his coronavirus response.”

bolsonaro has often appeared in public to shake hands with supporters and mingle with crowds, at times without a mask. he has said that his history as an athlete would protect him from the virus and that it would be nothing more than a “little flu” if he were to contract it.

he has also repeatedly said that there is no way to prevent 70% of the population falling ill with covid-19 and that local authorities’ efforts to shut down economic activity would ultimately cause more hardship than allowing the virus to run its course.

for nearly two months, brazil’s fight against covid-19 has been in the hands of an interim health minister with no health experience before april. he took over after his predecessor, a doctor and health care consultant, quit in protest over bolsonaro’s support for hydroxychloroquine.

bolsonaro on tuesday likened the virus to a rain that will fall on most people and said that some, like the elderly, must take greater care.

“you can’t just talk about the consequences of the virus that you have to worry about. life goes on. brazil needs to produce. you need to get the economy in gear,″ he said.

brazilian cities and states last month began lifting restrictions that had been imposed to control the spread of the virus, as deaths began to decline along with the caseload in intensive care units.

bolsonaro supporter silas ribeiro said on the streets of rio that the president is correct in saying the dangers of the virus have been exaggerated.

“our president is a popular man. he is showing that he isn’t afraid to die,” said ribeiro, 59. “he is going to have health and get through this sickness.”

speaking near recently reopened shops in rio, wesley morielo said he hopes bolsonaro’s sickness prompts him to reassess his stance.

“i think everything he said before, of not giving importance to covid-19, came back against him,″ said morielo, a 24-year-old student.

the world health organization’s emergencies chief, dr. michael ryan, wished bolsonaro a speedy recovery and said his infection “brings home the reality of this virus” by showing that it doesn’t distinguish between “prince or pauper.”

the president told reporters he underwent a lung x-ray on monday after experiencing fever, muscle aches and malaise. as of tuesday, his fever had subsided, he said, and he attributed the improvement to hydroxychloroquine.

he stepped back from the journalists and removed his mask at one point to show that he looks well.

brazil’s benchmark ibovespa stock index fell after bolsonaro’s announcement, and closed 1.2% down on the day.

bolsonaro has repeatedly visited the hospital since taking office, requiring several operations to repair his intestines after he was stabbed on the campaign trail in 2018.

he said on tuesday that he canceled a trip this week to the country’s northeast region and will continue working via videoconference and receive rare visitors when he needs to sign a document.

unlike britain’s prime minister, who moderated his rhetoric after testing positive for the virus, bolsonaro will probably not change his stance, said leandro consentino, a political science professor at insper, a university in sao paulo.

“he’s going down a path of trying to indicate to his base of support that covid-19 is just a little flu and take advantage of the illness to advertise for chloroquine,” consentino said.

on tuesday afternoon, bolsonaro posted a video to facebook of him taking his dose of hydroxychloroquine. “i trust hydroxychloroquine. what do you think?” he said while laughing.

over the weekend, the brazilian leader celebrated american independence day with the u.s. ambassador to brazil, then shared pictures on social media showing him in close quarters with the diplomat, several ministers and aides. none wore masks.

the u.s. embassy said on twitter that ambassador todd chapman is not showing any symptoms but would be tested.

bolsonaro tested negative three times in march after meeting with the trump in florida. members of his delegation to the u.s. were later reported to be infected.

Trump administration moves to formally withdraw US from WHO,273,hn1me3,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/506214-trump-administration-formally-withdraws-us-from-WHO-,40,1594180021.0,,"the white house has officially moved to withdraw the united states from the world health organization (who), a senior administration official confirmed tuesday, breaking ties with a global public health body in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

the u.s. has submitted its withdrawal notification to the united nations secretary-general, the official said. withdrawal requires a year's notice, so it will not go into effect until july 6, 2021, raising the possibility the decision could be reversed.

sen. bob menendez (n.j.), the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, tweeted that the administration informed congress of the withdrawal plans.

""to call trump’s response to covid chaotic & incoherent doesn't do it justice. this won't protect american lives or interests — it leaves americans sick & america alone,"" the senator tweeted.

the formal notification of withdrawal concludes months of threats from the trump administration to pull the united states out of the who, which is affiliated with the united nations. president trump donald john trump republican philadelphia official responsible for vote counting says office getting death threats biden will call governors, mayors about mask mandate trump campaign voter fraud hotline flooded with prank calls more has repeatedly assailed the organization for alleged bias toward china and its slow response to the coronavirus outbreak in wuhan.

but public health experts and democrats have raised alarms that the decision may be short-sighted and could undercut the global response to the pandemic, which has infected 11.6 million people worldwide. the u.s. has the highest number of reported cases in the world at nearly 3 million.

they have also argued that some of the who's initial missteps can be attributed to china's lack of transparency in the early stages of the outbreak.

“i disagree with the president’s decision,"" senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions chair lamar alexander andrew (lamar) lamar alexandermitch mcconnell might not endanger the planet republican bill hagerty wins tennessee senate race the spectre of pension failures haunts this election more (r-tenn.) said in a statement. ""certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the world health organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it.”

the president first froze funding for the who in april while his administration conducted a review of its relationship with the entity. weeks later, he wrote to the who demanding reforms but did not specify what those reforms would be.

trump announced at the end of may the u.s. was ""terminating"" ties with the who.

the move was cheered by conservatives who had accused the who of harboring pro-china bias and argued the global body was not a productive use of funds.

critics of the who have pointed to its initial assertion that the coronavirus could not be spread via human-to-human transmission, and trump has harped on the organization's opposition to travel bans after he imposed one on china.

trump and his allies have also lashed out at the who for failing to stop early warning signs of the outbreak.

china first alerted the who to the presence of a cluster of atypical pneumonia in the city of wuhan on dec. 31 after the who picked up reports through its epidemic intelligence system. but there is evidence to indicate the virus was circulating in wuhan as early as mid-november.

the united states contributes upwards of $400 million annually to the who — making it the group’s largest contributor — and public health experts have warned that a suspension of funds would severely damage the organization.

the timing of the administration's decision has drawn intense scrutiny and is likely to spur questions about u.s. involvement in global efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine.

""abandoning our seat at the table leaves the united states out of global decision-making to combat the virus and global efforts to develop and access vaccines and therapeutics, leaving us more vulnerable to covid-19 while diminishing our position as the leader in global health,"" thomas file, jr., president of the infectious diseases society of america, said in a statement.

""this decision is irresponsible, reckless, and utterly incomprehensible. withdrawing from the @who in the midst of the greatest public health crisis of our lifetime is a self-destructive move. more americans will be hurt by this careless choice,"" rep. eric swalwell eric michael swalwelltaylor swift allows song to be used in campaign ad graham says sc people of color can go anywhere in the state but 'need to be conservative, not liberal' president trump, melania trump test positive for covid-19 more (d-calif.) tweeted.

"Kanye West Says He’s Done With Trump—Opens Up About White House Bid, Damaging Biden And Everything In Between",38,hnhbls,https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2020/07/08/kanye-west-says-hes-done-with-trump-opens-up-about-white-house-bid-damaging-biden-and-everything-in-between/#897cc1b47aab,60,1594244733.0,,"kanye west’s fourth of july declaration, via tweet, that he was running for president lit the internet on fire, even as pundits were trying to discern how serious he was. over the course of four rambling hours of interviews on tuesday, the billionaire rapper turned sneaker mogul revealed:

that he’s running for president in 2020 under a new banner—the birthday party—with guidance from elon musk and an obscure vice presidential candidate he’s already chosen. “like anything i’ve ever done in my life,” says west, “i’m doing to win.”

that he no longer supports president trump. “i am taking the red hat off, with this interview.”

that he’s okay with siphoning off black votes from the democratic nominee, thus helping trump. “i’m not denying it, i just told you. to say that the black vote is democratic is a form of racism and white supremacy.”

that he’s never voted in his life.

that he was sick with covid-19 in february.

that he’s suspicious of a coronavirus vaccine, terming vaccines “the mark of the beast.”

that he believes “planned parenthoods have been placed inside cities by white supremacists to do the devil’s work.”

that he envisions a white house organizational model based on the secret country of wakanda in black panther.









and that’s just for starters. for much of the phone calls, his core message, strategically, was that he has 30 days to make a final decision about running for president. at that point, he says, he’d miss the filing deadline for most states, though he believes an argument could be made to get onto any ballots he’s missed, citing coronavirus issues. “i’m speaking with experts, i’m going to speak with jared kushner, the white house, with biden,” says west. he has no campaign apparatus of any kind. his advisors right now, he says, are the two people who notably endorsed him on the fourth: his wife, kim kardashian-west, and elon musk, of whom he says, “we’ve been talking about this for years.” (adds west: “i proposed to him to be the head of our space program.”)

an hour into the interview, the hedging was done: he says he definitely plans to run in 2020, versus his original plan in 2024. the campaign slogan: “yes!” his running mate? michelle tidball, an obscure preacher from wyoming. and why the birthday party? “because when we win, it’s everybody’s birthday.”

if it all sounds like a parody, or a particularly surreal episode of keeping up with the kardashians, west doesn’t seem to be in on it. calling from his ranch near cody, wyoming, where he says that he registered to vote for the first time on monday, west denies it is a publicity stunt for his upcoming album. (“i give my album away for free.”) a few weeks after he ended two separate text chains with me with the message “trump 2020” and a fist raised high, he insists he’s lost confidence in the president. “it looks like one big mess to me,” he says. “i don’t like that i caught wind that he hid in the bunker.” west also says that he contracted the coronavirus in late february, though he maintains that had nothing to do with his thoughts on running this year.









that said, he won’t say much more against trump. he’s much less shy about criticizing biden, which certainly won’t tamp down the idea that the birthday party is a ruse to help reelect trump. “i’m not saying trump’s in my way, he may be a part of my way. and joe biden? like come on man, please. you know? obama’s special. trump’s special. we say kanye west is special. america needs special people that lead. bill clinton? special. joe biden’s not special.”

from there, he holds forth on pretty much everything else, and occasionally breaks into spontaneous freestyle raps (“if i catch a vibe, i’m gonna catch that vibe”).





rapper kanye west speaks during a meeting with u.s. president donald trump in the oval office of the white house on october 11, 2018 in washington, dc. getty images





on his natural political party

“i would run as a republican if trump wasn’t there. i will run as an independent if trump is there.”





on his previous support for trump

“trump is the closest president we’ve had in years to allowing god to still be part of the conversation.”





on his maga hat moment

“one of the main reasons i wore the red hat as a protest to the segregation of votes in the black community. also, other than the fact that i like trump hotels and the saxophones in the lobby.”





on discussions on race with the white house

“one time i talked to jared kushner, who was saying, ‘we don’t have black leaders, we just have hustlers.’ why? because they killed all the black leaders.” (requests for comment from the white house and the kushner cos. last night were not immediately returned.)









on democrats

“that is a form of racism and white supremacy and white control to say that all black people need to be democrat and to assume that me running is me splitting the vote. all of that information is being charged up on social media platforms by democrats. and democrats used to tell me, the same democrats have threatened me. . . . the reason why this is the first day i registered to vote is because i was scared. i was told that if i voted on trump my music career would be over. i was threatened into being in one party. i was threatened as a celebrity into being in one party. i was threatened as a black man into the democratic party. and that’s what the democrats are doing, emotionally, to my people. threatening them to the point where this white man can tell a black man if you don’t vote for me, you’re not black.”





on how the race will be decided

“let’s see if the appointing is at 2020 or if it’s 2024—because god appoints the president. if i win in 2020 then it was god’s appointment. if i win in 2024 then that was god’s appointment.”





on the coronavirus cure

“we pray. we pray for the freedom. it’s all about god. we need to stop doing things that make god mad.”





on vaccines

“it’s so many of our children that are being vaccinated and paralyzed. . . . so when they say the way we’re going to fix covid is with a vaccine, i’m extremely cautious. that’s the mark of the beast. they want to put chips inside of us, they want to do all kinds of things, to make it where we can’t cross the gates of heaven. i'm sorry when i say they, the humans that have the devil inside them. and the sad thing is that, the saddest thing is that we all won’t make it to heaven, that there’ll be some of us that do not make it. next question.”





on deciding to run for president

“it’s when i was being offered the michael jackson video vanguard awards at mtv. i remember being at my mom’s house, my mother-in-law, because my house was being worked on, she calls me ‘son’ and i call her ‘mom,’ i was in the shower, thinking, i write raps in the shower. it hit me to say, ‘you’re going to run for president,’ and i started laughing hysterically, i was, like, this is the best, i'm going to go out there and they’re going to think i'm going to do these songs and do this for entertainment, how rigged awards shows are, and then say i’m going to run for president. and i just laughed in the shower, i don’t know for how long, but that’s the moment it hit me.”









on his foreign policy

“i haven’t developed it yet. i’m focused on protecting america, first, with our great military. let’s focus on ourselves first.”





on abortion

“i am pro-life because i’m following the word of the bible.”





on being a political novice

“i have to say with all humility that as a man, i don’t have all of the pieces in the puzzle. as i speak to you for what a political campaign—a political walk, as i told you, because i’m not running, i’m walking. i'm not running, we the people are walking. we’re not running anymore, we’re not running, we’re not excited—we are energized. someone can say, ‘hey, i got a brand new car for you, it’s across the street,’ and you get so excited you run across the street and get hit by a car trying to run to your new car. that’s how they control the black community, through emotions, they get us excited, we’re so excited, but then for 400 years the change doesn’t truly happen.





on the need for racial healing, after george floyd

“well, god has already started the healing/this conversation alone is healing and revealing/we all need to start praying and kneeling . . . another bar after that, but when a rhyme comes together i’m going to complete it, not inside the lines created by organizations that we know as our reality. the schools, the infrastructure was made for us to not truly be all we can be but to be just good enough to work for the corporations that designed the school systems. we’re tearing that up, what we’ll do is we’re not going to tear up the constitution, what we will do is amend.”





on black history month

“oh, one other thing—black history month. that is torture porn because when that comes up what we do is we see—and by the way, if i get that vibe—that’s the process and we are going to a beautiful, uplifting, fun, creative process as a people, as america collectively, and show the world how great we are. so here we go. black history month. every year they gotta remind us about the fact that we couldn’t vote, ‘they’ meaning white supremacy construct, and i said that with the ct at the end, i knew what was i was talking about . . . our minds are so much more infinite than what’s coming across tiktok or instagram, what’s trying to influence our children and the next generation of who we are.









on having covid-19

“chills, shaking in the bed, taking hot showers, looking at videos telling me what i’m supposed to do to get over it. i remember someone had told me drake had the coronavirus and my response was drake can’t be sicker than me!” (laughs)





on running in 2020

“god just gave me the clarity and said it’s time. you know i was out there, ended up in the hospital, people were calling me crazy. i'm not crazy. between all of the influences and the positions that we can be put in as musicians—you go on tour, you put out all these albums, and you look up and you don’t have any money in your account. it can drive you crazy, through all of that i was looking crazy because it wasn’t the time. now it’s time. and we’re not going crazy, we’re going yeezy, it’s a whole ‘notha level now. n-o-t-h-a.





on joe biden

“a lot of times just like political parties they feel all blacks have to be democrat. this man, joe biden, said if you don’t vote for me, then you are not black. well, act like we didn’t hear that? we act like we didn’t hear that man say that? that man said that. it’s a rap. we gonna walk, all the people. jay-z said it best. for the other candidates, i just gracefully suggest y’all bow out—trump and biden, gracefully bow out. it’s god’s country, we are doing everything in service to god, nobody but god no more. i am in service of our lord and savior, jesus christ, and i put everything i get on the line to serve god.”





on developing policies

“i don’t know if i would use the word ‘policy’ for the way i would approach things. i don’t have a policy when i went to nike and designed yeezy and went to louis and designed a louis vuitton at the same time. it wasn’t a policy, it was a design. we need to innovate the design to be able to free the mind at this time.”









on the wakanda management model

“a lot of africans do not like the movie [black panther] and representation of themselves in…wakanda. but i’m gonna use the framework of wakanda right now because it’s the best explanation of what our design group is going to feel like in the white house…that is a positive idea: you got kanye west, one of the most powerful humans—i’m not saying the most because you got a lot of alien-level superpowers and it’s only collectively that we can set it free. let’s get back to wakanda . . . like in the movie in wakanda when the king went to visit that lead scientist to have the shoes wrap around her shoes. just the amount of innovation that can happen, the amount of innovation in medicine—like big pharma—we are going to work, innovate, together. this is not going to be some nipsey hussle being murdered, they’re doing a documentary, we have so many soldiers that die for our freedom, our freedom of information, that there is a cure for aids out there, there is going to be a mix of big pharma and holistic.”





on prayer in schools

“reinstate in god’s state, in god’s country, the fear and love of god in all schools and organizations and you chill the fear and love of everything else. so that was a plan by the devil to have our kids committing suicide at an all-time high by removing god, to have murders in chicago at an all-time high because the human beings working for the devil removed god and prayer from the schools. that means more drugs, more murders, more suicide.”





on taxes

“i haven’t done enough research on that yet. i will research that with the strongest experts that serve god and come back with the best solution. and that will be my answer for anything that i haven’t researched. i have the earplug in and i’m going to use that earplug.”





on china

“when i become president—let me make some promises—the nba will open all the way back up from nigeria to nanchang and the world will see the greatest athletes play. the world will experience the change in their element. the money is gonna come back. i love china. i love china. it’s not china’s fault that disease. it’s not the chinese people’s fault. they’re god’s people also. i love china. it changed my life. it changed my perspective, it gave me such a wide perspective. my mom as an english professor taught english in china when i was in fifth grade.”









on capital punishment

“‘thou shalt not kill.’ i’m against the death penalty.”





on police killings

one of my to-do lists is to end police brutality. the police are people, too. to end laws that don’t make sense. like, in the george floyd case, there was a black guy that went to jail and it was his first day on the force. so if it’s your first day on the force and it’s your training day, and this og-accredited cop with 18 violations already starts filing out, are you going to jump in front of that person and lose your job that same day? especially in this climate when 40,000 people lost their jobs? this man was put in a position where—and also he probably didn’t realize that the cop was going to take it that far, he probably was so scared, in shock, paralyzed, like so many black people. i'm one of the few black people that would speak openly like this.





on his other priorities

“clean up the chemicals. in our deodorant, in our toothpaste, there are chemicals that affect our ability to be of service to god.”





on his campaign slogan

“well my second album is called late registration. i got a rap . . . the other thing is, my campaign is kanye west yes, not yep, not yeah. yes. yes. yes. . . . when i’m president, let’s also have some fun. let’s get past all the racism conversation, let’s empower people with 40 acres and a mule, let’s give some land, that’s the plan.”"

washington (ap) — the supreme court ruled broadly wednesday in favor of the religious rights of employers in two cases that could leave more than 70,000 women without free contraception and tens of thousands of people with no way to sue for job discrimination.

in both cases the court ruled 7-2, with two liberal justices joining conservatives in favor of the trump administration and religious employers.

in the more prominent of the two cases, involving president barack obama’s health care overhaul, the justices greenlighted changes the trump administration had sought. the administration announced in 2017 that it would allow more employers to opt out of providing the no-cost birth control coverage required under the law, but lower courts had blocked the changes.

the ruling is a significant election-year win for president donald trump, who counts on heavy support from evangelicals and other christian groups for votes and policy backing. it was also good news for the administration, which in recent weeks has seen headline-making supreme court decisions go against its positions.

in one of those earlier cases, the court rejected trump’s effort to end legal protections for 650,000 young immigrants . in another, the justices said a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment .

another particularly important decision for trump is ahead. the justices are expected to announce thursday whether congress and the manhattan district attorney can see the president’s taxes and other financial records he has fought to keep private.

in its second big ruling on wednesday, the court sided with two catholic schools in california in a decision underscoring that certain employees of religious schools can’t sue for employment discrimination.

lay teachers whose contracts had not been renewed had sued their schools. but justice samuel alito wrote in his majority opinion: “when a school with a religious mission entrusts a teacher with the responsibility of educating and forming students in the faith, judicial intervention into disputes between the school and the teacher threatens the school’s independence in a way that the first amendment does not allow.”

the court’s birth-control decision was cheered by conservative groups, and white house spokeswoman kayleigh mcenany joined in. “today’s supreme court ruling is a big win for religious freedom and freedom of conscience,” she said in a statement.

liberal groups and democrats, including house speaker nancy pelosi, decried the decision, which she called a “fundamental misreading” of the health care law. presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden said the decision will make it “easier for the trump-pence administration to continue to strip health care from women.”

the trump administration is still seeking to overturn obama’s affordable care act in its entirety. it has joined texas and other republican-led states in calling on the justices to do just that. the case is scheduled to be argued in the court term that begins in october.

justice clarence thomas, writing for the majority of the court, said in wednesday’s decision that the administration has the authority to make its birth-control coverage changes and followed appropriate procedures in doing so.

the government has estimated that the rule changes would cause between 70,000 women and 126,000 women to lose contraception coverage in one year.

justice ruth bader ginsburg cited those numbers in dissenting.

“today, for the first time, the court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree,” she wrote in a dissent joined by justice sonia sotomayor.

birth control coverage has been a topic of contention since the health care law was passed.

“the aca’s contraceptive mandate ... has existed for approximately nine years. litigation surrounding that requirement has lasted nearly as long,” thomas wrote.

initially, churches, synagogues and mosques were exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement. the obama administration also created a way by which religiously affiliated organizations including hospitals, universities and charities could opt out of paying for contraception, but women on their health plans would still get no-cost birth control. some groups complained the opt-out process itself violated their religious beliefs, and years of legal wrangling followed.

after trump took office, officials announced changes. under a new policy issued by the department of health and human services, more categories of employers, including publicly traded companies, can opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious objections. the policy also allows some employers, though not publicly traded companies, to raise moral objections and do the same.

the changes were blocked by courts after new jersey and pennsylvania challenged them.

future administrations could attempt to alter the trump administration rules. and two liberal justices who sided with the administration, elena kagan and stephen breyer, suggested the legal fight over the administration’s changes may continue.

pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro said in a statement after the ruling, “this fight is not over.”

in the religious-schools discrimination case, the court had ruled unanimously in 2012 that the constitution prevents ministers from suing their churches for employment discrimination, but the justices didn’t rigidly define who counts as a minister.

"Narcissists, Psychopaths, and Manipulators Are More Likely To Engage in 'Virtuous Victim Signaling,' Says Study",15,hnovi8,https://reason.com/2020/07/07/narcissists-psychopaths-and-manipulators-are-more-likely-to-engage-in-virtuous-victim-signaling-says-study/,3,1594268973.0,,"new study links virtue signaling to ""dark triad"" traits. being accused of ""virtue signaling"" might sound nice to the uninitiated, but spend much time on social media and you know that it's actually an accusation of insincerity. virtue signalers are, essentially, phonies and showoffs—folks who adopt opinions and postures solely to garner praise and sympathy or whose good deeds are tainted by their need for everyone to see just how good they are. combined with a culture that says only victimhood confers a right to comment on certain issues, it's a big factor in online pile-ons and one that certainly contributes to social media platforms being such a bummer sometimes.

so: here's some fun new research looking at ""the consequences and predictors of emitting signals of victimhood and virtue,"" published in the journal of personality and social psychology. the paper—from university of british columbia researchers ekin ok, yi qian, brendan strejcek, and karl aquino—details multiple studies the authors conducted on the subject.

their conclusion? psychopathic, manipulative, and narcissistic people are more frequent signalers of ""virtuous victimhood.""

the so-called ""dark triad"" personality traits—machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy—lead to characteristics like ""self-promotion, emotional callousness, duplicity, and tendency to take advantage of others,"" the paper explains.

and ""treated as a composite, the dark triad traits were significant predictors of virtuous victim signaling.""

this held true ""even when controlling for factors that may make people vulnerable to being mistreated or disadvantaged in society (i.e., demographic and socioeconomic characteristics) as well as the importance they place on being a virtuous individual as part of their self-concept,"" the researchers note.

they point out that virtue signaling is defined as ""the conspicuous expression of moral values, done primarily with the intent of enhancing one's standing within a social group.""

meanwhile, victim signaling ""may be used as a social influence tactic that can motivate recipients of the signal to voluntarily transfer resources to the signaler,"" they explain. more from the paper's theoretical background section:

an emerging literature on competitive victimhood documents the prevalence of victim signaling by various social groups and provides evidence for its functionality as a resource extraction strategy. for instance, victim signaling justifies victim groups seeking retribution against alleged oppressors. retribution often takes the form of demanding compensation through some kind of resource transfer from nonvictims to the alleged victim. claiming victim status can also facilitate resource transfer by conferring moral immunity upon the claimant. moral immunity shields the alleged victim from criticism about the means they might use to satisfy their demands. in other words, victim status can morally justify the use of deceit, intimidation, or even violence by alleged victims to achieve their goals. relatedly, claiming victim status can lead observers to hold a person less blameworthy, excusing transgressions, such as the appropriation of private property or the infliction of pain upon others, that might otherwise bring condemnation or rebuke. finally, claiming victim status elevates the claimant's psychological standing, defined as a subjective sense of legitimacy or entitlement to speak up. a person who has the psychological standing can reject or ignore any objections by nonvictims to the unreasonableness of their demands. in contrast to victim signalers, people who do not publicly disclose their misfortune or disadvantage are less likely to reap the benefits of retributive compensation, moral immunity, deflection of blame, or psychological standing and would therefore find it difficult to initiate resource transfers. the effectiveness of victim signaling as a resource transfer strategy follows the basic principles of signaling theory. signaling theory posits that the transmission of information from one individual (the sender) to another (the receiver) can influence the behavior of the receiver. signals can refer to any physical or behavioral trait of the sender, and are used by the senders to alter the behaviors of others to their own advantage.

their results suggest that:

""a perceived victim signal can lead others to transfer resources to a victim, but that the motivation to do so is amplified when the victim signal is paired with a virtue signal"" and ""people high in the dark triad traits emit the dual signal more frequently.""

""a positive correlation between the dark triad scores and the frequency of emitting the virtuous victim signal.""

""evidence of how these signals … can predict a person's willingness to engage in and endorse ethically questionable behaviors …. frequent virtuous victim signalers are more willing to purchase counterfeit products and judge counterfeiters as less immoral compared with less frequent signalers, a pattern that was also observed when using participants' dark triad scores instead of their signaling score,"" and ""frequent virtuous victim signalers were more likely to cheat and lie to earn extra monetary reward in [a] coin flip game.""

""that a dimension referred to as amoral manipulation was the most reliable predictor of virtuous victim signaling.""

""frequent virtuous victim signalers were more likely to make inflated claims to justify receiving restitution for an alleged and ambiguous norm violation in an organizational context.""

the authors stress that they ""do not refute the claim that there are individuals who emit the virtuous victim signal because they experience legitimate harm and also conduct themselves in decent and laudable ways.""

washington (ap) — political task forces joe biden formed with onetime rival bernie sanders to solidify support among the democratic party’s progressive wing recommended wednesday that the former vice president embrace major proposals to combat climate change and institutional racism while expanding health care coverage and rebuilding a coronavirus-ravaged economy.

but they stopped short of urging biden’s full endorsement of policies that could prove too divisive for some swing voters in november, like universal health coverage under “medicare for all” or the sweeping green new deal environmental plan.

advertisement

the groups, formed in may to tackle health care, immigration, education, criminal justice reform, climate change and the economy, sought to hammer out a policy road map to best defeat president donald trump. their 110 pages of recommendations should help shape the policy platform democrats will adopt during their national convention next month — even though the entire party platform adopted in 2016 ran only about 50 pages.

the task forces sought to help biden, a center-left establishment candidate, engage skeptical progressives who’d backed other 2020 candidates, especially sanders and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who is under consideration for biden’s running mate. biden hoped the groups would promote party unity and help him avoid a repeat of 2016, when many sanders supporters remained disillusioned enough that they stayed home rather than support hillary clinton against trump.

they recommend that biden commit to moving the u.s. to being fully powered by renewable energy, and meeting other key environmental benchmarks, by 2035. that’s far more ambitious than the 2050 deadline he embraced during the primary. they also call for a 100-day moratorium on deportations and a series of steps to overhaul the economy in an effort to reduce economic and racial inequality.

“while joe biden and i, and our supporters, have strong disagreements about some of the most important issues facing our country, we also understand that we must come together in order to defeat donald trump, the most dangerous president in modern american history,” sanders, a vermont senator, said in a statement. biden thanked sanders for “working together to unite our party, and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come.”

still, the recommendations don’t include a ban on hydraulic fracturing that could hurt biden in the energy-producing swing state of pennsylvania. there’s also no endorsement for medicare for all, which dominated debate during the democratic presidential primary but could alienate voters afraid of losing their current, employer-based private health coverage. instead, the recommendations list ways to expand health insurance coverage by building on the obama administration’s signature law.

advertisement

“we still believe that medicare for all is the right way to go and we’re still going to continue to fight for that,” said democratic rep. pramila jayapal of washington state, who co-led the health care task force. “but this was a situation where joe biden had already put a stake in the sand on the affordable care act and it was part of his legacy with president obama.”

varshini prakash, executive director of the sunrise movement, served on the environmental advisory group and said she was encouraged by the finished product. she noted that it does not include specific recommendations on how many new jobs biden hopes to create in the sector or spell out how much money he would commit to making his promises a reality. also omitted is the green new deal, the comprehensive anti-climate change plan that prakash’s group champions.

still, prakash said biden making the recommendations a centerpiece of his campaign can help bolster his support among young people, latinos and working class voters.

“if joe biden takes this plan that he has signed off on and campaigns really, really hard on it, if he understands the economic opportunity that exists in tackling the climate crisis, if he can speak to the level of urgency and the level of swift, scalable action that we need to be taking, he will appeal to so many of the voters that he needs to unite,” prakash said.

their conclusions come as biden and democratic party officials enter the main phase of writing the platform. the campaign’s and the party’s entire policy apparatus acquired added weight after the pandemic, resulting economic collapse and national reckoning on systemic racism spurred biden to start talking in bolder tones about the need to “rewrite the economy.”

biden plans to travel thursday to pennsylvania, where he will begin detailing an economic package that his aides pitch as a direct preview of the policies he would pursue should he win. progressives who have been in contact with biden’s campaign noted that he’s consulted with sanders and warren while devising it.

biden is expected to emphasize american manufacturing and labor policies, including how government can aim its buying power to bolster u.s. manufacturing. that will likely include an emphasis on ratcheting up government purchases of medical supplies that would address the pandemic.

“this will be the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure and r&d (research and development) since world war ii, and that’s just a part of the plan,” said senior adviser jake sullivan.

New U.S. CDC school reopening guidelines promised after Trump complains - Reuters,93,ho28c4,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-education/new-us-cdc-school-reopening-guidelines-promised-after-trump-complains-idUSKBN24922X,13,1594326601.0,,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention plans to issue new guidelines for reopening schools, vice president mike pence said on wednesday, after president donald trump criticized the agency’s recommendations as too expensive and impractical.

trump, a republican who is seeking re-election in november, accused democrats of wanting to keep schools shut for political reasons and threatened to cut off federal funding to schools that do not reopen, despite a surge in coronavirus cases.

“i disagree with @cdcgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. while they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. i will be meeting with them!!!” trump said on twitter.

flanked by top administration health and education officials, pence said the cdc next week will issue a “new set of tools ... to give more clarity on the guidance going forward.

“the president said today we just don’t want the guidance to be too tough,” pence said at a white house coronavirus task force briefing at the department of education.

cdc director robert redfield stressed that agency guidelines were not requirements.

“it would be personally very disappointing to me, and i know my agency, if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools,” redfield said.

white house spokeswoman kayleigh mcenany told reporters the white house did not pressure the cdc to revise its recommendations.

the cdc has made a number of recommendations for schools, including testing for covid-19, dividing students into small groups, serving packaged lunches in classrooms instead of cafeterias, and minimizing sharing of school supplies.

it has advised that seats be spaced at least six feet apart and that sneeze guards and partitions be put in place when social distancing is not possible.

administration officials said local leaders would tailor their decisions on how schools reopen.

“ultimately it’s not a matter of if schools should reopen, it’s simply a matter of how. they must fully open,” education secretary betsy devos said.

states are responsible for primary and secondary education under the u.s. constitution, but some have been holding off on deciding when and how to open schools, concerned about the resurgence of coronavirus across the country.

the u.s. outbreak has crossed the 3 million mark in confirmed cases, with a death toll of 131,336, according to a reuters tally.

“the dems think it would be bad for them politically if u.s. schools open before the november election, but is important for the children & families. may cut off funding if not open!” trump said on twitter.

acknowledging that the lion’s share of school funding comes from states, pence said that the administration would work with congress to look for ways “to give states a strong incentive and encouragement to get kids back to school.”

“it’s time for us to get our kids back to school,” he said.

the federal government provides some supplementary funding for schools, including through congressional appropriations. with democrats controlling the house of representatives, any effort to curtail funding is sure to face roadblocks.

mcenany said trump is “looking at potential redirecting (of funding) to make sure it goes to the student and it is most likely tied to the student and not to a district where schools are closed.”

labor secretary eugene scalia said school reopenings were necessary for the u.s. economic recovery. business and conservative groups have said parents need to get back to work.

on tuesday, trump said he would pressure state governors to open schools in the fall.

however, the surge in u.s. cases has raised concerns about the increased risk of children spreading the virus to vulnerable adults at home as well as to older teachers and school staff.

new york governor andrew cuomo said the federal government has no authority on schools and his state will announce its reopening plans in the first week of august.

in neighboring new jersey, governor phil murphy said he planned to reopen state schools in the fall, but reserved the right to “tweak that if it means saving lives.”"

U.S. Supreme Court rules against Trump bid to conceal financial records from prosecutor,379,ho42my,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-trump/u-s-supreme-court-rules-against-trump-bid-to-conceal-financial-records-from-prosecutor-idUSKBN24A1C6,58,1594333848.0,,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. supreme court on thursday firmly rejected president donald trump’s arguments for sweeping presidential immunity and ruled that a new york prosecutor can obtain his financial records but prevented - at least for now - democratic-led house of representatives committees from getting similar documents.

the twin 7-2 rulings authored by conservative chief justice john roberts mark another milestone in trump’s tumultuous presidency and in the short term prevent details of his finances from becoming public because lower courts must resolve lingering issues.

the businessman-turned politician, seeking re-election on nov. 3, has fought tenaciously to keep his tax returns and other elements of his finances secret - and the rulings spare him of any major revelation at a sensitive time. but looking further ahead, trump faces possible future criminal prosecution in his native new york, perhaps after he leaves office.

the supreme court emphasized that there are limits to the powers of the presidency and stoutly reaffirmed the principle that not even the president is above the law - a message delivered 3-1/2 years into a presidency in which trump has repeatedly skirted the norms of american political conduct.

trump’s two supreme court appointees, conservatives neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh, joined roberts and the four liberal justices in both rulings, spurning trump’s arguments that the constitution gave him absolute immunity from any criminal proceedings as a sitting president.

manhattan district attorney cyrus vance, a democrat, and the three house committees all issued subpoenas to third parties for the records, not to the republican president himself. trump sued to block enforcement of the subpoenas.

the court in the new york case ruled that the subpoena to trump’s long-term accounting firm, mazars llp, for tax returns and other financial records to be turned over to a grand jury as part of vance’s criminal investigation can be enforced.

the justices rebuffed trump’s broad arguments on expansive presidential powers in a showdown with congress as he tried to block subpoenas by lawmakers to mazars and two banks - deutsche bank and capital one - for his financial records. in doing so, the court also faulted the broad arguments made by the house and sent the litigation back to lower courts, delaying the final outcome.

trump portrayed himself as a victim, calling the subpoenas a “pure witch hunt” and a “hoax” in comments to reporters. on twitter, he wrote, “this is all a political prosecution ... and now i have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt new york. not fair to this presidency or administration!”

trump’s argument that he was immune from any criminal process “runs up against the 200 years of precedent establishing that presidents, and their official communications, are subject to judicial process,” roberts wrote.

“we affirm that principle today and hold that the president is neither absolutely immune from state criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need,” roberts added.

roberts rejected the suggestion that the decision would subject future presidents to harassment by local prosecutors, noting that the court in 1997 rejected a similar argument made by president bill clinton when he faced a civil lawsuit brought by a woman who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances - litigation the court refused to delay.

the court in 1974, roberts noted, also ruled that president richard nixon must turn over audio tapes in the watergate scandal that eventually drove him to resign.

‘he is hiding’

unlike other recent presidents, trump has refused to release his tax returns and other documents that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family real-estate company, the trump organization.

house speaker nancy pelosi said democrats will continue to investigate trump and seek to enforce the subpoenas.

slideshow ( 4 images )

“congress’s constitutional responsibility to uncover the truth continues, specifically related to the president’s russia connection that he is hiding,” pelosi said, referring to the possibility that trump’s financial records could show such an entanglement.

roberts said lawmakers will need to further explain the need for the records at the lower court, which would then assess the burden placed on the president.

jay sekulow, trump’s personal lawyer, said he would “raise additional constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts.”

vance’s investigation into trump and the trump organization was spurred by disclosures of hush payments to two women who said they had past sexual relationships with the president, pornographic film actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal - relationships he has denied.

trump argued that congress lacked a valid purpose for seeking his records and that such disclosure would compromise his and his family’s privacy and distract him from his duties. in the vance investigation, trump’s lawyers argued before a lower court that law enforcement officials would not have the power to investigate him even if he shot someone on new york’s fifth avenue.

the house oversight committee issued its subpoenas after michael cohen, his former lawyer, told congress trump had inflated and deflated certain assets on financial statements between 2011 and 2013 in part to reduce his real estate taxes.

the house financial services committee is examining possible money laundering in u.s. property deals involving trump. the house intelligence committee is investigating whether trump’s dealings left him vulnerable to the influence of foreign individuals or governments.

U.S. Supreme Court deems half of Oklahoma a Native American reservation,315,ho59s9,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-oklahoma/u-s-supreme-court-deems-half-of-oklahoma-a-native-american-reservation-idUSKBN24A2BE,27,1594337952.0,,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. supreme court on thursday recognized about half of oklahoma as native american reservation land and overturned a tribe member’s rape conviction because the location where the crime was committed should have been considered outside the reach of state criminal law.

file photo: the u.s. supreme court building is seen in washington, u.s., june 30, 2020. reuters/carlos barria/file photo

the justices ruled 5-4 in favor of a man named jimcy mcgirt and agreed that the site of the rape should have been recognized as part of a reservation based on the historical claim of the muscogee (creek) nation - beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities.

the decision means that for the first time much of eastern oklahoma is legally considered reservation land. more than 1.8 million people live in the land at issue, including roughly 400,000 in tulsa, oklahoma’s second-largest city.

conservative justice neil gorsuch wrote the ruling, joining the court’s four liberals in the majority.

gorsuch referenced the complex historical record that started with the forced relocation by the u.s. government of native americans, including the creek nation, to oklahoma in a traumatic 19th century event known as the “trail of tears.” at the time, the u.s. government pledged that the new land would be theirs in perpetuity.

“today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. because congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word,” gorsuch wrote.

gorsuch rejected the state’s arguments, which he said would require turning a “blind eye” to the federal government’s past promises.

in a joint statement, the state, the creek nation and the other four of what is known as the “five tribes” of oklahoma said they were making “substantial progress” toward an agreement on shared jurisdiction that they would present to the federal government. the other tribes are the cherokee, chickasaw, choctaw and seminole.

“the nations and the state are committed to implementing a framework of shared jurisdiction that will preserve sovereign interests and rights to self-government while affirming jurisdictional understandings, procedures, laws and regulations that support public safety, our economy and private property rights,” the statement said.

unless changes are made, tribe members who live within the boundaries would now become exempt from certain state obligations such as paying state taxes, while certain native americans found guilty in state courts would be able to challenge their convictions on jurisdictional grounds. the tribe also may obtain more power to regulate alcohol sales and expand casino gambling.

the ruling voided mcgirt’s sentence of 1,000 years in prison but he could face a new trial in federal court rather than state court.

under u.s. law, tribe members who commit crimes on tribal land cannot be prosecuted in state courts and instead are subject to federal prosecution, which sometimes can be beneficial to defendants. reservations were established beginning in the 19th century after u.s. authorities expelled native americans from their traditional lands.

mcgirt, 71, has served more than two decades in prison after being convicted in 1997 in wagoner county in eastern oklahoma of rape, lewd molestation and forcible sodomy of a 4-year-old girl. mcgirt, who did not contest his guilt in the case before the justices, had appealed a 2019 ruling by a state appeals court in favor of oklahoma.

mcgirt is a member of the seminole nation. the crime occurred on land historically claimed by the creek nation.

at issue was whether the muscogee (creek) nation territory where the crime was committed should be considered a native american reservation or whether congress eliminated that status around the time oklahoma became a state in 1907.

oklahoma argued that the creek nation never had a reservation. but even if one existed, the state and president donald trump’s administration argued, it long ago was eliminated by congress.

a reservation is land managed by a tribe under the federal bureau of indian affairs and generally exempt from state jurisdiction."
Supreme Court Rules Nearly Half of Oklahoma Is Indian Reservation,54,ho5jt8,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/supreme-court-oklahoma-mcgirt-creek-nation.html,8,1594338911.0,[deleted],"“this is a historic day,” principal chief david hill said in an interview. “this is amazing. it’s never too late to make things right.”

the ruling comes at an extraordinary time for native americans.

they are being ravaged by the coronavirus both in the soaring numbers of cases and deaths and the economic distress caused by closed casinos. but at the same moment, the nationwide movement to confront systemic racism has infused new energy and attention to generations-long fights by tribal nations and indigenous activists over land, treaty rights and discrimination.

in the past few weeks, tribal activists garnered international attention after they blocked the roads outside mount rushmore to condemn president trump’s visit to what they called stolen lands. they won a fight to shut down an oil pipeline that crossed sacred ground in north dakota. in the face of growing pressure from corporate sponsors, the washington redskins of the n.f.l. recently promised to re-evaluate their team name, which activists have denounced for years as racist.

on social media, people celebrated thursday’s decision with the declaration native lives matter.

“this brings these issues into public consciousness a little bit more,” said john echohawk, executive director of the native american rights fund, a nonprofit organization that has spent five decades fighting for issues like tribal sovereignty and recognition. “that’s one of the biggest problems we have, is that most people don’t know very much about us.”

the court’s decision means that indigenous people who commit crimes on the eastern oklahoma reservation, which includes much of tulsa, cannot be prosecuted by state or local law enforcement, and must instead face justice in tribal or federal courts.

chief justice john g. roberts jr. warned in a dissenting opinion that the court’s decision would wreak havoc and confusion on oklahoma’s criminal justice system."

little rock, ark. (ap) — federal officials were so worried jeffrey epstein’s longtime confidant ghislaine maxwell might take her own life after her arrest that they took away her clothes and bedsheets and made her wear paper attire while in custody, an official familiar with the matter told the associated press.

the steps to ensure maxwell’s safety while she’s locked up at a federal jail in new york city extend far beyond the measures federal officials took when they first arrested her in new hampshire last week.

the justice department has added extra security precautions and placed federal officials outside the bureau of prisons in charge of ensuring there is adequate protection for maxwell. that’s to help prevent other inmates from harming her and to stop her from harming herself, the official said.

the concern comes in part because epstein, 66, killed himself in a federal jail in manhattan last summer while in custody on sex trafficking charges, spawning conspiracy theories over his death despite a medical examiner ruling it a suicide. the sprawling case against him ensnared british royalty and american elite who attended parties at his mansions. whispers over who knew what and when about epstein even reached the white house, after video surfaced of president donald trump and the financier chatting at a mar-a-lago party in 1992.

the case appeared dormant until maxwell was arrested last thursday on charges she helped lure at least three girls — one as young as 14 — to be sexually abused by epstein, who was accused of victimizing dozens of girls and women over many years.

maxwell, the daughter of the late british publishing magnate robert maxwell, was the former girlfriend and longtime close associate of epstein. she is accused of facilitating his crimes and even joining him in sexually abusing the girls, according to the indictment against her. several epstein victims have described maxwell as his chief enabler, recruiting and grooming girls for abuse. she has denied wrongdoing and called claims against her “absolute rubbish.”

maxwell was arrested by a team of federal agents last week at a $1 million estate she had purchased in new hampshire. the investigators had been keeping an eye on maxwell and knew she had been hiding out in various locations in new england.

she had switched her email address, ordered packages under someone else’s name and registered at least one new phone number under an alias “g max,” prosecutors have said.

when the agents swooped in to arrest her, they weren’t sure that she was even at the home, the official said. some investigators believed she may have already fled the united states to avoid prosecution, the official added.

maxwell was not sent to the same jail. rather, she was taken to the metropolitan detention center in brooklyn, just over the brooklyn bridge from where epstein was held.

the other protocols put in place for maxwell’s confinement include ensuring that she has a roommate in her cell, that she is monitored and that someone is always with her while she’s behind bars, the official said.

the official could not discuss the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity.

the bureau of prisons has been the subject of intense scrutiny since epstein’s death, with staff shakeups and leadership changes. attorney general william barr said his death was the result of the “perfect storm of screw ups.”

the bureau of prisons has been plagued for years by serious misconduct, violence and staffing shortages so severe that guards often work overtime day after day or are forced to work mandatory double shifts. it has also struggled recently with an exploding number of coronavirus cases in prisons across the u.s."
India Goes All In On ‘Boycott China’,91,horcro,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/07/10/india-goes-all-in-on-boycott-china/#691ab4d36e19,5,1594425027.0,,"protesters burn an image of chinese president xi jinping at a demonstration requesting consumers to ...

blame it on the pandemic and the border dispute in the himalayan regional territory of ladakh, but the result is the same: some indian businesses are boycotting china.

earlier this month, over 50 chinese apps were banned, including popular consumer apps like wechat, tiktok and baidu maps. india is in a dispute with china, and now many small business owners, and even the government, are working to turn away from made in china.

the government is now asking indian e-commerce companies like flipkart and amazon india amzn to label country of origin for all products sold on its websites.

india is setting itself up to be a testing lab for what the u.s. might do if china relations continue to worsen. this will especially be true if trump gets re-elected, and doubly so if the new sars coronavirus makes a comeback in the winter and hospitals are overrun in key cities, like new york, once again. the attitude towards china will harden in that case.

indeed, it already has in india.

companies have until august 1 to roll out labeling with some items being pushed out further into october, suggesting this is a trend that is here for the medium term.

the companies reportedly asked for more time to label the millions of goods for sale on their platforms.

the move can also be viewed through the lens of economic protectionism at a time when india’s economy, like everyone else’s, is reeling from the impacts of lockdowns and coronavirus mitigation policies. the “boycott china” movement may not be an official boycott, but it is designed to limit the number of goods china sells to india in hopes india can pick up the slack.

companies like flipkart said the measures should be introduced in a phased manner with the involvement of manufacturers and sellers in the process, the economic times reported today.

like here in the u.s., there is no requirement to display country of origin on non-packaged goods. india’s department for promotion of industry and internal trade is scheduled to discuss the new legal provisions with the dozens of online retailers and the consumer affairs ministry in the days ahead.

“no decision was taken yet,” an anonymous government official told the et. “it was only a consultation and follow-up of the previous meeting. a deadline will be decided later.”

online retailers said they preferred a phased-in approach and said they will try to get manufacturers on board to help comply with the government’s new labeling requirements, all in effort to highlight what’s from china, in hopes to get some to buy something else."

new york (ap) — the u.s. roman catholic church used a special and unprecedented exemption from federal rules to amass at least $1.4 billion in taxpayer-backed coronavirus aid, with many millions going to dioceses that have paid huge settlements or sought bankruptcy protection because of clergy sexual abuse cover-ups .

the church’s haul may have reached -- or even exceeded -- $3.5 billion, making a global religious institution with more than a billion followers among the biggest winners in the u.s. government’s pandemic relief efforts , an associated press analysis of federal data released this week found.

houses of worship and faith-based organizations that promote religious beliefs aren’t usually eligible for money from the u.s. small business administration. but as the economy plummeted and jobless rates soared, congress let faith groups and other nonprofits tap into the paycheck protection program , a $659 billion fund created to keep main street open and americans employed.

by aggressively promoting the payroll program and marshaling resources to help affiliates navigate its shifting rules, catholic dioceses, parishes, schools and other ministries have so far received approval for at least 3,500 forgivable loans, ap found.

the archdiocese of new york, for example, received 15 loans worth at least $28 million just for its top executive offices. its iconic st. patrick’s cathedral on fifth avenue was approved for at least $1 million.

in orange county, california, where a sparkling glass cathedral estimated to cost over $70 million recently opened, diocesan officials working at the complex received four loans worth at least $3 million.

and elsewhere, a loan of at least $2 million went to the diocese covering wheeling-charleston, west virginia, where a church investigation revealed last year that then-bishop michael bransfield embezzled funds and made sexual advances toward young priests.

simply being eligible for low-interest loans was a new opportunity. but the church couldn’t have been approved for so many loans -- which the government will forgive if they are used for wages, rent and utilities -- without a second break.

religious groups persuaded the trump administration to free them from a rule that typically disqualifies an applicant with more than 500 workers. without this preferential treatment, many catholic dioceses would have been ineligible because -- between their head offices, parishes and other affiliates -- their employees exceed the 500-person cap.

“the government grants special dispensation, and that creates a kind of structural favoritism,” said micah schwartzman, a university of virginia law professor specializing in constitutional issues and religion who has studied the paycheck protection program. “and that favoritism was worth billions of dollars.”

the amount that the church collected, between $1.4 billion and $3.5 billion, is an undercount. the diocesan fiscal management conference, an organization of catholic financial officers, surveyed members and reported that about 9,000 catholic entities received loans. that is nearly three times the number of catholic recipients the ap could identify.

the ap couldn’t find more catholic beneficiaries because the government’s data, released after pressure from congress and a lawsuit from news outlets including the ap, didn’t name recipients of loans under $150,000 -- a category in which many smaller churches would fall. and because the government released only ranges of loan amounts, it wasn’t possible to be more precise.

even without a full accounting, ap’s analysis places the catholic church among the major beneficiaries in the paycheck protection program, which also has helped companies backed by celebrities, billionaires, state governors and members of congress.

the program was open to all religious groups, and many took advantage. evangelical advisers to president donald trump, including his white house spiritual czar, paula white-cain, also received loans .

‘truly in need’

there is no doubt that state shelter-in-place orders disrupted houses of worship and businesses alike.

masses were canceled, even during the holy week and easter holidays, depriving parishes of expected revenue and contributing to layoffs in some dioceses. some families of catholic school students are struggling to make tuition payments. and the expense of disinfecting classrooms once classes resume will put additional pressure on budgets.

but other problems were self-inflicted. long before the pandemic, scores of dioceses faced increasing financial pressure because of a dramatic rise in recent clergy sex abuse claims.

the scandals that erupted in 2018 reverberated throughout the world. pope francis ordered the former archbishop of washington, cardinal theodore mccarrick , to a life of “prayer and penance” following allegations he abused minors and adult seminarians. and a damning grand jury report about abuse in six pennsylvania dioceses revealed bishops had long covered for predator priests, spurring investigations in more than 20 other states.

as the church again reckoned with its longtime crisis, abuse reports tripled during the year ending june 2019 to a total of nearly 4,500 nationally. meanwhile, dioceses and religious orders shelled out $282 million that year — up from $106 million just five years earlier. most of that went to settlements, in addition to legal fees and support for offending clergy.

loan recipients included about 40 dioceses that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few years paying victims through compensation funds or bankruptcy proceedings. ap’s review found that these dioceses were approved for about $200 million, though the value is likely much higher.

one was the new york archdiocese. as a successful battle to lift the statute of limitations on the filing of child sexual abuse lawsuits gathered steam, cardinal timothy dolan established a victim compensation fund in 2016. since then, other dioceses have established similar funds, which offer victims relatively quick settlements while dissuading them from filing lawsuits.

spokesperson joseph zwilling said the archdiocese simply wanted to be “treated equally and fairly under the law.” when asked about the waiver from the 500-employee cap that religious organizations received, zwilling deferred to the u.s. conference of catholic bishops.

a spokesperson for the bishops’ conference acknowledged its officials lobbied for the paycheck program, but said the organization wasn’t tracking what dioceses and catholic agencies received.

“these loans are an essential lifeline to help faith-based organizations to stay afloat and continue serving those in need during this crisis,” spokesperson chieko noguchi said in a written statement. according to ap’s data analysis, the church and all its organizations reported retaining at least 407,900 jobs with the money they were awarded.

noguchi also wrote the conference felt strongly that “the administration write and implement this emergency relief fairly for all applicants.”

not every catholic institution sought government loans. the ukrainian catholic eparchy based in stamford, connecticut, told ap that even though its parishes experienced a decline in donations, none of the organizations in its five-state territory submitted applications.

deacon steve wisnowski, a financial officer for the eparchy, said pastors and church managers used their rainy-day savings and that parishioners responded generously with donations. as a result, parishes “did not experience a severe financial crisis.”

wisnowski said his superiors understood the program was for “organizations and businesses truly in need of assistance.”

lobbying for a break

the law that created the paycheck protection program let nonprofits participate, as long as they abided by sba’s “affiliation rule.” the rule typically says that only businesses with fewer than 500 employees, including at all subsidiaries, are eligible.

lobbying by the church helped religious organizations get an exception.

the catholic news service reported that the bishops’ conference and several major catholic nonprofit agencies worked throughout the week of march 30 to ensure that the “unique nature of the entities would not make them ineligible for the program” because of how sba defines a “small” business. those conversations came just days after president trump signed the $2 trillion coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act, which included the paycheck protection program.

in addition, federal records show the los angeles archdiocese, whose leader heads the bishops’ conference, paid $20,000 to lobby the u.s. senate and house on “eligibility for non-profits” under the cares act. the records also show that catholic charities usa, a social service arm of the church with member agencies in dioceses across the country, paid another $30,000 to lobby on the act and other issues.

in late april, after thousands of catholic institutions had secured loans, several hundred catholic leaders pressed for additional help on a call with president trump. during the call, trump underscored the coming presidential election and touted himself as the candidate best aligned with religious conservatives, boasting he was the “best (president) the catholic church has ever seen,” according to crux, an online publication that covers church-related news.

the lobbying paid off.

catholic charities usa and its member agencies were approved for about 110 loans worth between $90 million and $220 million at least, according to the data.

in a statement, catholic charities said: “each organization is a separate legal entity under the auspices of the bishop in the diocese in which the agency is located. ccusa supports agencies that choose to become members, but does not have any role in their daily operations or governance.”

the los angeles archdiocese told ap in a survey that reporters sent before the release of federal data that 247 of its 288 parishes -- and all but one of its 232 schools -- received loans. the survey covered more than 180 dioceses and eparchies.

like most dioceses, los angeles wouldn’t disclose its total dollar amount. while the federal data doesn’t link catholic recipients to their home dioceses, ap found 37 loans to the archdiocese and its affiliates worth between $9 million and $23 million, including one for its downtown cathedral.

in 2007, the archdiocese paid a record $660 million to settle sex abuse claims from more than 500 victims. spokespeople for los angeles archbishop jose m. gomez did not respond to additional questions about the archdiocese’s finances and lobbying.

in program materials, sba officials said they provided the affiliation waiver to religious groups in deference to their unique organizational structure, and because the public health response to slow the coronavirus’ spread disrupted churches just as it did businesses.

a senior official in the u.s. department of the treasury, which worked with the sba to administer the program, acknowledged in a statement the wider availability of loans to religious organizations. “the cares act expanded eligibility to include nonprofits in the ppp, and sba’s regulations ensured that no eligible religious nonprofit was excluded from participation due to its beliefs or denomination,” the statement said.

meanwhile, some legal experts say that the special consideration the government gave faith groups in the loan program has further eroded the wall between church and state provided in the first amendment. with that erosion, religious groups that don’t pay taxes have gained more access to public money, said marci hamilton, a university of pennsylvania professor and attorney who has represented clergy abuse victims on constitutional issues during bankruptcy proceedings.

“at this point, the argument is you’re anti-religious if in fact you would say the catholic church shouldn’t be getting government funding,” hamilton said.

cashing in fast

after its lobbying blitz, the catholic church worked with parishes and schools to access the money.

many dioceses -- from large ones such as the archdiocese of boston to smaller ones such as the diocese of la crosse, wisconsin -- assembled how-to guides to help their affiliates apply. the national catholic fiscal conference also hosted multiple webinars with legal and financial experts to help coach along local leaders.

federal data show that the bulk of the church’s money was approved during the loan program’s first two weeks. that’s when demand for the first-come, first-served assistance was so high that the initial $349 billion was quickly exhausted, shutting out many local businesses.

overall, nearly 500 loans approved to catholic entities exceeded $1 million each. the ap found that at least eight hit the maximum range of $5 million to $10 million. many of the listed recipients were the offices of bishops, headquarters of leading religious orders, major churches, schools and chapters of catholic charities.

also among recipients was the saint luke institute. the catholic treatment center for priests accused of sexual abuse and those suffering from other disorders received a loan ranging from $350,000 to $1 million. based in silver spring, maryland, the institute has at times been a way station for priests accused of sexual abuse who returned to active ministry only to abuse again.

perhaps nothing illustrates the church’s aggressive pursuit of funds better than four dioceses that sued the federal government to receive loans, even though they entered bankruptcy proceedings due to mounting clergy sex-abuse claims. small business administration rules prohibit loans to applicants in bankruptcy.

the archdiocese of santa fe, new mexico -- once home to a now-closed and notorious treatment center for predator priests -- prevailed in court, clearing the way for its administrative offices to receive nearly $1 million. it accused the sba of overreaching by blocking bankruptcy applications when congress didn’t spell that out.

yet even when a diocese has lost in bankruptcy court, or its case is pending, its affiliated parishes, schools and other organizations remain eligible for loans.

on the u.s. territory of guam, well over 200 clergy abuse lawsuits led church leaders in the tiny archdiocese of agana to seek bankruptcy protection, as they estimated at least $45 million in liabilities. even so, the archdiocese’s parishes, schools and other organizations have received at least $1.7 million as it sues the sba for approval to get a loan for its headquarters, according to bankruptcy filings.

the u.s. church may have a troubling record on sex abuse, but bishop lawrence persico of erie, pennsylvania, pushed back on the idea that dioceses should be excluded from the government’s rescue package. approximately 80 organizations within his diocese received loans worth $10.3 million, the diocese said, with most of the money going to parishes and schools.

persico pointed out that church entities help feed, clothe and shelter the poor -- and in doing so keep people employed.

“i know some people may react with surprise that government funding helped support faith-based schools, parishes and dioceses,” he said. “the separation of church and state does not mean that those motivated by their faith have no place in the public square.”

Trump Commutes Sentence of Roger Stone in Case He Long Denounced,47,hp0ehw,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-roger-stone-clemency.html,3,1594455510.0,,"the debate over clemency for mr. stone has raged within the white house for months. among those who advocated on behalf of it from outside the building were tucker carlson, the influential fox news anchor, and representative matt gaetz, republican of florida, according to people familiar with the discussions.

within the white house, mr. stone had few allies. many trump aides who knew him from the campaign did not like him, were envious of his long relationship with mr. trump or thought clemency would be bad politics.

mark meadows, the white house chief of staff, expressed concern about potential political consequences, according to two people familiar with the discussions, although he has left people with different impressions about where he stands. the same is true of jared kushner, mr. trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, who has been involved in most of the clemency discussions throughout the past three years.

pat a. cipollone, the white house counsel, was concerned about intervening on mr. stone’s behalf, according to the people close to the discussions. one of the few within the white house who backed clemency was larry kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser and an old friend of mr. stone’s. mr. kudlow spends more time with mr. trump than many other advisers.

“mr. stone is incredibly honored that president trump used his awesome and unique power under the constitution of the united states for this act of mercy,” grant smith, mr. stone’s lawyer, said after the announcement. “mr. and mrs. stone appreciate all the consideration the president gave to this matter.”

mr. stone has been one of the most flamboyant rogues in american politics for decades, maintaining a wardrobe of more than 100 suits, bleaching his hair, posing for photographs half-naked and cheerfully engaging in dirty tricks that others would disavow. he made political contributions to a republican challenger to president richard m. nixon in 1972 under the name of the young socialist alliance and hired an operative to try to infiltrate the campaign of george mcgovern, the democratic candidate.

he was accused of leaving a threatening, profanity-laced voice mail message for the father of gov. eliot spitzer of new york, resulting in mr. stone’s resignation. but he later got his revenge on mr. spitzer by claiming credit for spreading the rumor that the governor wore black dress socks during sexual escapades with prostitutes."
Trump commutes longtime adviser Roger Stone's prison sentence,327,hp0eso,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-stone/trump-commutes-longtime-adviser-roger-stones-prison-sentence-idUSKBN24B351,42,1594455546.0,,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump commuted the sentence of his longtime friend and adviser roger stone, sparing him from prison after he was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election.

trump’s decision to commute stone’s sentence days before he was due to report to prison marked the republican president’s most assertive intervention to protect an associate in a criminal case and his latest use of executive clemency to benefit an ally. democrats condemned trump’s action, announced on friday evening, as an assault on the rule of law.

in his first remarks on his decision, trump on saturday painted stone as a victim and lashed out against democratic presumptive presidential nominee joe biden and former president barack obama, with whom biden served as vice president.

“roger stone was targeted by an illegal witch hunt that never should have taken place. it is the other side that are criminals, including the fact that biden and obama illegally spied on my campaign - and got caught!” the president tweeted.

the veteran republican political operative’s friendship with trump dates back decades. stone, 67, was scheduled to report by tuesday to a federal prison in jesup, georgia, to begin serving a sentence of three years and four months.

trump, seeking re-election on nov. 3, opted to give stone a commutation, which does not erase a criminal conviction, rather than a full pardon.

stone emerged from his fort lauderdale, florida home on friday night after the commutation of his sentence was announced wearing a mask with the words “free roger stone.”

“this is a horrific, horrific nightmare when you realize that this investigation never had any legitimate or lawful beginning, it was a witch hunt,” stone said using some of the same words trump has hurled at prosecutors and democrats who investigated moscow’s role in the 2016 u.s. election.

stone was among several trump associates charged with crimes in former special counsel robert mueller’s investigation that documented russian interference to boost trump’s 2016 candidacy.

the white house criticized mueller’s investigation and the prosecutors in stone’s case, saying the left and its allies in the media attempted for years to undermine the trump presidency.

mueller’s investigation found extensive contacts between trump’s campaign and russians.

republican reaction on capitol hill was largely muted, with a handful of trump allies welcoming the action.

but senator mitt romney, the only republican to vote to convict trump at his senate impeachment trial, denounced the action on twitter: “unprecedented, historic corruption: an american president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president.”

congressional democrats and other critics have accused trump of undermining the rule of law by publicly complaining about criminal cases against associates including stone, former white house national security adviser michael flynn and former campaign chairman paul manafort.

“congress will take action to prevent this type of brazen wrongdoing,” u.s. house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi said in a statement on saturday. “legislation is needed to ensure that no president can pardon or commute the sentence of an individual who is engaged in a cover-up campaign to shield that president from criminal prosecution.”

guilty on all counts

a washington jury in november 2019 convicted stone on all seven criminal counts of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to congress and tampering with a witness.

trump repeatedly lashed out on twitter about stone’s case, accusing prosecutors of being corrupt, the juror forewoman of political bias and the judge of treating his friend unfairly.

attorney general william barr earlier intervened in the case to scale back the justice department’s sentencing recommendation, leading four career prosecutors to quit the proceedings.

one of them, aaron zelinsky, told lawmakers on june 24 that his supervisor in the u.s. attorney’s office in washington was told to go easy on stone for political reasons.

stone was convicted for lying to the house intelligence committee about his attempts to contact wikileaks, the website that released damaging emails about trump’s 2016 democratic election rival hillary clinton that u.s. intelligence officials have concluded were stolen by russian hackers.

the u.s. constitution gives a president the “power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states, except in cases of impeachment.” trump’s use of this executive clemency often has benefited allies and well-connected political figures.

he pardoned hardline former arizona county sheriff joe arpaio, former republican white house aide lewis “scooter” libby, conservative commentator dinesh d’souza and convicted “junk bond king” michael milken. he also commuted the prison sentence of democratic former illinois governor rod blagojevich, who had been a contestant on trump’s former reality tv show.

stone has been a fixture in american partisan battles dating to the 1970s. a colorful figure known for his natty attire, he has labeled himself an “agent provocateur” and famously has the face of former president richard nixon tattooed on his back."

“what it tells us is left to its own devices, the c.d.c. can do a pretty good job in compiling a comprehensive document that shows the complexity of what institutions are facing,” said terry w. hartle, a senior vice president of the american council on education, which represents 1,700 college and university presidents and higher education executives.

“the good news is, this is very thoughtful and complete,” he added. “the bad news is, it’s never been released.”

a breakdown of state plans included in the briefing also identified state and university proposals that the task force appeared to see as models. the document identified as “examples of consistency with c.d.c. guidance” institutions like arizona western university, which will offer virtual services to students and staff members throughout the fall, and hampton university, where in-person class sizes and gatherings will be reduced to 50 percent. it also highlights a number of states, like georgia, where families are offered an option of in-person and virtual classes.

and as mr. trump and education secretary betsy devos were trying to pressure local schools to comply with their reopening vision, the document was expressly saying the federal government should not override local judgment.

“these c.d.c. considerations are meant to supplement — not replace — any federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations” with which schools must comply, the packet states in bold lettering. “implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, and acceptable and be tailored to the needs of each community.”

the document was among material for federal response teams that are being dispatched to hot spots around the country for short periods of time. the teams are charged with helping local public health officials address the outbreak, including identifying the source, if possible, and what additional support from the federal government might help. in doing this, the team could field questions about school safety plans."

Here are some updates, notes, and requests for feedback:

**Rule 3 revised**

Overall, we're going to be tightening enforcement of Rule 3. After extensive discussion within the mod team and taking into account user feedback, we've also made some adjustments to the wording. It now reads:

We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort comments, sarcasm, jokes, memes, off-topic replies, pejorative name-calling, or comments about source quality. Use the monthly feedback post for meta discussion about the sub.

The first change is that the prohibition against sarcasm got moved from Rule 1 to Rule 3, which means it now includes sarcasm about the topic at hand, not just sarcasm directed at other users.

We also now explicitly consider ""comments about source quality"" to be off topic. Our moderation practice around this was inconsistent before, so now we're making it official. A news article should spawn comments about the covered event, not critiques about the news organization conveying the information. There are other subs for these kinds of discussions, like /r/media_criticism.

**What is ""substantive""?**

Three of our four rules are fairly black & white. Rules 2 and 4 are essentially questions of syntax, and with Rule 1, it's usually pretty easy to determine if someone is being discourteous. But Rule 3 is more of a judgment call, and that presents particular issues, especially when one of our main goals is consistent moderation.

To that end, mods have been discussing what defines ""substantive"" under Rule 3 and we'd like to get some user feedback. 

To give an example, a user might have a short insight on how an article fits into a larger story, such as, ""This is especially important in light of yesterday's court decision."" Is that comment itself substantive enough to be allowed in NeutralNews, or should mods remove it? Would it make a difference if it linked to the referenced court decision? If it's not substantive enough, how much would it need to be expanded to cross that line? And finally, how do we compose a rule that not only makes the term ""substantive"" clear to the users, but also guides the mod team towards consistent enforcement standards?

These are big questions and we look forward to reading your ideas.

**Are there topics we don't want here?**

The issue of what kind of content we should have in this subreddit most frequently comes up around sports and entertainment news. But the question facing the mods is not really whether we *want* these topics, but whether we should prohibit them.

it's been two weeks since we relaunched this subreddit after a long hiatus. we've had a net increase of 3,250 subscribers in that time.

things have been going decently well. there have been a few hiccups, but overall, discussion quality seems better and the sub is more manageable. it's still a work in progress though, so please read the list below and help us continue to make this place better.

— r/neutralnews mod team

here are some updates, notes, and requests for feedback:

rule 3 revised

overall, we're going to be tightening enforcement of rule 3. after extensive discussion within the mod team and taking into account user feedback, we've also made some adjustments to the wording. it now reads:

be substantive. neutralnews is a serious discussion-based subreddit. we do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort comments, sarcasm, jokes, memes, off-topic replies, pejorative name-calling, or comments about source quality. use the monthly feedback post for meta discussion about the sub.

the first change is that the prohibition against sarcasm got moved from rule 1 to rule 3, which means it now includes sarcasm about the topic at hand, not just sarcasm directed at other users.

we also now explicitly consider ""comments about source quality"" to be off topic. our moderation practice around this was inconsistent before, so now we're making it official. a news article should spawn comments about the covered event, not critiques about the news organization conveying the information. there are other subs for these kinds of discussions, like r/media_criticism. ours is a news sub and we'll stick to hosting discussions of current events, not discussions about those telling us about the current events.

"Amid pandemic, wealthy U.S. families approved for government loans - Reuters",342,hqfa6c,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ppp-familyoffice/amid-pandemic-wealthy-u-s-families-approved-for-government-loans-idUSKCN24E130,16,1594675801.0,,"boston (reuters) - private investment firms that manage the fortunes of wealthy individuals and their kin were approved for millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief loans designed to help small businesses weather the coronavirus lockdown, according to a review of recently released government data.

jacob gottlieb, managing partner & chief investment officer, visium asset management, attends a panel discussion titled ""covering your assets: a crash course on investing in a macro driven environment"" at the annual skybridge alternatives conference in las vegas, nevada, u.s. may 8, 2013. reuters/rick wilking

the companies - often referred to as “family offices” - approved for the forgivable loans from the small business administration (sba) included those that oversee money for the family that co-owns the national basketball association’s sacramento kings; the former manager of a multi-billion dollar hedge fund firm; and a serial las vegas entrepreneur.

the data from the u.s. treasury department and sba shows only that the loans were approved from the paycheck protection program (ppp) but does not say how much was disbursed or if they had been returned or forgiven. still, it was not always clear why the families found it necessary to apply for emergency cash, usually for less than $1 million, given the substantial funds available implied by their having private investing vehicles.

“the ppp was meant for struggling small businesses who aren’t able to operate at normal capacity,” said andrew park, senior policy analyst at americans for financial reform. “this is akin to dipping their hands into a charity jar.”

among those approved, rothschild capital partners llc, a new york-based firm that manages money for its chief executive, david d. rothschild and others, got the go-ahead for a loan of up to $350,000 to retain eight jobs. the firm managed approximately $330 million at the end of 2019 on behalf of the rothschild family and a group of wealthy investors, according to public filings.

representatives for rothschild did not respond to requests for comment.

the family offices identified by reuters usually applied for the sba loans in march or april, when financial markets were substantially lower or some of their portfolio companies were struggling.

the zarrow family office llc in tulsa, oklahoma, confirmed to reuters that it received a ppp loan and said it used the money to support shared staff with its family foundations at a time when its investments had declined, allowing for continued assistance to local non-profits. the public data shows a loan to zarrow of between $150,000 and $350,000 and 14 jobs retained. the anne and henry zarrow foundation had assets of $473 million at the end of 2018, according to a public filing.

“when this national program became available, the stock market had just experienced a significant loss with projections of more to come,” bill major, the executive director of zarrow’s foundations, wrote in an email. “the funds were procured to maintain the staff and to maximize the funds available to support non-profits who were in crisis.”

about 2,000 firms that manage money or advise on investments, such as hedge funds or wealth advisers here, were approved for loans meant to shore up payroll and rent costs for small companies, according to the data released last week.

reuters findings prompted criticism of the trump administration from the campaign staff of u.s. presidential candidate joe biden.

“the news that some of america’s wealthiest families were benefiting from federal aid intended for small businesses even in the middle of an avoidable economic collapse is despicable — but not surprising,” kate bedingfield, biden’s deputy campaign manager and communications director, said in a statement.

ken farnaso, deputy national press secretary for the trump campaign, said that view from biden’s camp was intentionally misleading and the program was a job-saving success.

“it’s sad that the former vice president and democrats across the country have politicized a lifesaving program that even some of them were blessed to have benefitted from,” farnaso told reuters by email.

all told, the sba said in a report, finance and insurance firms represented $12.2 billion across 168,462 loans, about 2.3% of the program’s total lending as of june 30.

others that were approved for ppp loans include raj capital management llc in newport beach, california. raj is a family office for the bhathal family, which made its fortune in swimwear and now co-owns the sacramento kings, among other investments. the public data shows a loan to raj of between $150,000 and $350,000 and 11 jobs retained.

lisa bhathal merage, managing partner of raj, said in an email that the ppp funds the company accessed were on the “lower side” of the reported range.

“our family is not taking ppp. the use of funds is used to support the staffing of a new business venture that experienced disruption,” she said. “this business’ payroll flows through the umbrella of raj capital management, that is why the ppp was applied for and granted under this name.”

yamagata enterprises family office llc, tied to serial las vegas entrepreneur gene yamagata, was approved for two ppp loans of as much as $350,000 from separate banks, according to the data. a 2019 real estate credit report from rating agency dbrs said yamagata’s reported net worth was approximately $93 million as of november 2018.

the family office of former high-profile hedge fund manager jacob gottlieb, new york-based altium capital management lp, was also approved for up to $350,000 to retain eight jobs, according to the disclosure. gottlieb until recently ran the approximately $8 billion visium asset management before it shut down amid a financial fraud scandal here.

representatives for yamagata and gottlieb did not respond to requests for comment.

overall, the government loan program protected about 51.1 million american jobs here, the trump administration said last monday, as it revealed how $521.4 billion in taxpayer cash was injected into small businesses.

but problems in the data have cast doubt on the projection of how many jobs were saved, reuters has reported here.

the loans were largely approved on a good-faith basis, with borrowers certifying to their eligibility and the accuracy of the data they provided, meaning the figures on how many jobs were retained have not been thoroughly vetted. loans that appear to breach the letter or spirit of the rules may not be forgiven.

the treasury plans to conduct a full review of loans of more than $2 million, meaning for now, at least many of the loans to family firms may fall under the radar."

Biden clean-energy plan would spend $2 trillion over four years,30,hr3a77,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/biden-clean-energy-plan-would-spend-2-trillion-over-four-years-idUSKCN24F202,14,1594768347.0,,"wilmington, del. (reuters) - democratic presidential candidate joe biden on tuesday outlined an ambitious climate plan that would spend $2 trillion over four years investing in clean-energy infrastructure while vowing to cut carbon emissions from electrical power to zero in 15 years.

the plan signifies a more aggressive approach on climate policy than he adopted during the democratic presidential primary – a nod to progressives within the party who have been clamoring for swift, bold action.

“let’s not waste any more time,” biden said at a campaign event in wilmington, delaware. “let’s get to work now, now.”

beyond the goal of reducing carbon emissions, biden said his climate package would provide a badly needed jolt to a u.s. economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, ultimately creating millions of new jobs in the clean-energy sector.

“when donald trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is ‘hoax.’ when i think about climate change, the word i think of is ‘jobs.’ good-paying union jobs that put americans to work,” said biden, who will face president trump, a republican, in the nov. 3 election.

biden’s revised climate plan would require the country to be producing 100% clean electricity by 2035, moving up his original target date by 15 years – a timeline borrowed from former presidential candidates jay inslee and elizabeth warren.

since emerging as the prospective democratic nominee, biden has been pressed by activists in the party to adopt more expansive climate policies.

his proposal now would spend more money more quickly than his original approach, calling for $2 trillion in new spending during his first term as president, according to a copy of the plan released by his campaign. he had first suggested spending $1.7 trillion over a decade.

the plan would seek to boost the u.s. auto industry through incentives for manufacturers to produce zero-emission electric vehicles. and it would look to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public-housing units.

biden’s plan also has a large environmental justice emphasis and would direct 40% of clean-energy spending toward disadvantaged communities in the shadows of refineries and power plants.

activist groups such as the sunrise movement, which had been critical of biden’s climate plans in the past, praised him on tuesday for showing more urgency on the issue.

but two republican congressmen from energy-producing states, steve scalise of louisiana and mike kelly of pennsylvania, blasted biden’s proposal in a press call held by the trump campaign.

they accused biden of pandering to the party’s liberal wing and warned that instead of boosting the economy, the plan would do away with thousands of high-paying jobs and increase electricity costs, with middle- and low-income families bearing the brunt.

paying for the plan

climate change is less of a concern for many americans this summer with the nation largely focused on the coronavirus pandemic and the recession. less than 5% of u.s. adults said in a july 6-7 reuters/ipsos poll that the environment is a top priority for the country.

in comparison, 28% listed the economy or the nation’s rising unemployment as their top concern. another 16% said it was healthcare.

campaign advisers on tuesday said the plan is a component of biden’s overall economic recovery package, which they described as the largest mobilization of public investment since world war two.

the campaign will further detail how it intends to cover the cost of the recovery package in the coming weeks, aides said, but pointed to biden’s pledge to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthiest americans and reverse trump’s tax cuts for top-end earners.

many of biden’s proposals could be done through executive orders, his aides said. but the large-scale outlays would require congressional approval.

the american petroleum institute, a trade group in washington, suggested biden’s plan could harm the u.s. oil and gas industry, forcing the country to look to foreign sources of energy with lower environmental standards.

“you can’t address the risks of climate change without america’s natural gas and oil industry,” said mike sommers, the institute’s chief executive."

lee was pronounced dead by the coroner at 8:07 a.m. et in terre haute, indiana. his last words were ""i didn't do it. i've made a lot of mistakes in my life but i'm not a murderer. you're killing an innocent man,"" according to a pool report.

the supreme court cleared the way for the resumption of the federal death penalty in an unsigned order released after 2 a.m. et tuesday.

the court wiped away a lower court order temporarily blocking the execution of lee in a 5-4 vote.

lee, a one-time white supremacist who killed a family of three, was scheduled to be executed monday. a federal judge blocked the planned execution of lee, and three others, citing ongoing challenges to the federal government's lethal injection protocol.

Judge denies bail for Ghislaine Maxwell after she pleads not guilty in Jeffrey Epstein sex crimes case,85,hr9uva,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/jeffrey-epstein-case-ghislaine-maxwell-sex-crimes-bail-ruling.html,4,1594789117.0,,"ghislaine maxwell appears via video link during her arraignment hearing where she was denied bail for her role aiding jeffrey epstein to recruit and eventually abuse of minor girls, in manhattan federal court, in new york, july 14, 2020 in this courtroom sketch. jane rosenberg | reuters

a federal judge on tuesday denied bail for ghislaine maxwell, the british socialite accused of facilitating the sexual abuse of young girls in the mid-1990s by her former boyfriend jeffrey epstein, the now-dead investor. maxwell, who will remain in jail pending trial, pleaded not guilty at the bail hearing in manhattan federal court, where her lawyer had sought her release on a $5 million bond. maxwell poses ""a substantial risk of flight,"" said judge alison nathan. ""the risk is simply too great"" for maxwell to be released on bail, nathan said. the judge noted maxwell's wealth, her citizenship in britain and france, other international ties, and her lack of strong family or business connections in the united states, as she denied the bail request. nathan also cited the ""seriousness"" of maxwell's alleged crimes as a reason she would have to flee and said no bail condition, or combination of conditions, would ensure she would willingly appear in court on the charges. maxwell, 58, faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted of crimes that include enticing minors into traveling to have sex with epstein, and perjury. the daughter of the dead crooked british media baron robert maxwell did not visibly react to the judge's decision, which she saw and listened to via a video teleconference from a brooklyn, new york, federal jail. the bail denial came nearly a year to the day after epstein was himself denied bail on child sex trafficking charges after his lawyers offered to post a whopping $100 million bond. a federal prosecutor who argued against maxwell's bail request told nathan that maxwell had posed as ""jen marshall,"" a ""journalist"" who was seeking privacy, last november when she looked at purchasing the new hampshire house where she was found in her pajamas and arrested by fbi agents on the morning of july 2.

maxwell, according to a real estate agent involved in the purchase, posed as the wife of a man who identified himself as ""scott marshall,"" a purported retired member of the british military who was writing a book, the prosecutor, alison moe, said. the $1 million house, which sits on more than 150 acres of land, later was bought by a legal entity set up for that purpose, and to hide the actual identity of the people who purchased the residence. the real estate agent realized that maxwell was the british-accented ""journalist"" who used another name after she saw news stories about her arrest, moe said. the prosecutor said that maxwell's deception with the real estate agent, and other factors, warranted detaining her without bail, as did wealth of up to $10 million in assets, at least $4 million of which is in a swiss bank account. maxwell, who waived her physical appearance in court due to the coronavirus pandemic, spoke in a clear, firm voice as she denied the charges laid out in a six-count indictment against her. ""not guilty,"" maxwell told nathan early in the hearing, which lasted slightly more than two hours, and which was listened to on a conference call by more than 1,000 people. nathan scheduled maxwell's trial to begin on july 12, 2021. moe estimated that the trial would take three weeks.

annie farmer, one of three women whose claims are the basis for the criminal case against maxwell, told the judge that she should deny the bail request, saying that ""the danger maxwell posed must be taken seriously."" ""she is a sexual predator who groomed and abused me and countless other children and young women. she has never shown any remorse for her heinous crimes or the devastating, lasting effects her actions caused,"" farmer said, after telling the judge she first met maxwell when she was 16 years old. farmer, who requested to be identified by her real name during the court hearing, said, ""those that survived implore this court that she be detained pending trial."" another accuser, identified as jane doe, said in a statement read to the judge by moe, that, ""without ghislaine, jeffrey could not have done what he did.""

"Trump downplays police violence against Black people, says 'more white people' killed",86,hrf0fa,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-trump/trump-downplays-police-violence-against-black-people-says-more-white-people-killed-idUSKCN24F2WQ,91,1594807679.0,,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump on tuesday praised u.s. police departments and downplayed police violence against black people, saying “more white people” are killed by police officers.

during a cbs news interview, the republican president was asked why black people were still dying at the hands of law enforcement.

“and so are white people, so are white people. what a terrible question to ask. so are white people. more white people, by the way. more white people,” trump responded.

the may 25 death of african-american george floyd while in police custody in minneapolis sparked protests across the united states and has led to an increased focus on u.s. police violence against black people.

according to a washington post analysis updated on monday, half of people killed by police are white, but black americans are shot at a disproportionate rate. they account for less than 13 percent of the u.s. population but are killed by police at over twice the rate of white americans, the newspaper analysis found.

some americans argue that the black lives matter protests have unfairly maligned the police forces.

trump, speaking to reporters at the white house, defended police departments, saying they “do an incredible job in this country.”

“you can have a rogue, terrible cop, on occasion like you do in any industry, any business, in any profession,” trump added.

the american civil liberties union’s jeffery robinson said in a statement in response that trump’s comments were racist.

“trump’s racism is so absolute that he continues to refuse to give even a tacit acknowledgment to the epidemic of police violence against black people in america,” he said.

recent social unrest has raised new questions about the flying of the confederate battle flag in areas of the country and whether statues honoring confederate leaders during the u.s. civil war should be removed from prominent places.

asked by cbs if the flag should be “taken down,” trump responded: “i know people that like the confederate flag and they’re not thinking about slavery.”

he added: “it’s freedom of speech.”"

within 10 minutes, he had company: three armed men dressed in fatigues emblazoned with the logo of a major drug cartel.

the traffickers had a particular interest in that tower, owned by boston-based american tower corp amt.n, which rents space to carriers on its thousands of cellular sites in mexico. the cartel had installed its own antennas on the structure to support their two-way radios, but the contractor had unwittingly blacked out the shadowy network.

the visitors let him off with a warning.

“i was so nervous... seeing them armed in front of you, you don’t know how to react,” the worker told reuters, recalling the 2018 encounter. “little by little, you learn how to coexist with them, how to address them, how to make them see that you don’t represent a threat.”

the contractor had disrupted a small link in a vast criminal network that spans much of mexico. in addition to high-end encrypted cell phones and popular messaging apps, traffickers still rely heavily on two-way radios like the ones police and firefighters use to coordinate their teams on the ground, six law enforcement experts on both sides of the border told reuters.

traffickers often erect their own radio antennas in rural areas. they also install so-called parasite antennas on existing cell towers, layering their criminal communications network on top of the official one. by piggybacking on telecom companies’ infrastructure, cartels save money and evade detection since their own towers are more easily spotted and torn down, law enforcement experts said.

the practice has been widely acknowledged by telecom companies and mexican officials for years. the problem persists because the government has made inconsistent efforts to take it on, and because companies have little recourse to stop it, experts on law enforcement and mexican society said.

“there is a sense of powerlessness” in mexico, said duncan wood, director of the wilson center’s mexico institute in washington. he said companies feel they “cannot respond to issues like this because (they) are afraid of the consequences from groups that essentially enjoy impunity.”

mexico’s defense ministry said it provides security for federal agencies that request its help in dismantling “parasitic equipment” installed by cartels on cell towers.

the nation’s attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment about criminal activity at these sites. the federal telecommunications institute, mexico’s telecom and broadcasting regulator, said its compliance unit had not received reports of parasite antennas from any companies under its jurisdiction.

reuters has provided the first in-depth account of how traffickers exploit mexico’s telecom infrastructure and the toll it takes on workers. the news organization interviewed 14 current and former telecom workers about the interactions that they and their colleagues have had with criminal groups at cell towers.

twelve of them said they had seen parasite antennas on towers belonging to telesites sab de cv sitesb1.mx, a tower rental company in which the family of mexican billionaire carlos slim is a major shareholder; as well as american tower, u.s. carrier at&t corp, spain's telefonica sa tef.mc and mexico's axtel sab de cv axtelcpo.mx.

reuters is omitting the technicians’ names, details of where they work and most names of cartels they encounter for the workers’ protection. two technicians shared texts they exchanged with colleagues regarding on-the-job run-ins with organized crime at the cell towers, and one of them shared a photo of an illicit device he discovered in the course of his work. the incidents the 12 workers recounted occurred between 2015 and 2020 in several mexican states.

most of the technicians said they encounter the devices, known colloquially as narco-antennas, just a few times a year. but one engineer who spoke with reuters estimated that parasite antennas are present on roughly 20% of towers where his firm works, while another said about 30% of his sites had them when local criminals were particularly active in his area in 2018.

their no. 1 rule when discovering cartel equipment on a tower is simple: don’t touch it.

dealing with gangsters in person is trickier, they said, requiring diplomacy and a cool head. some said their interactions have been cordial, bordering on friendly. others said they have been threatened, detained and at times fearful for their lives.

the traffickers “convey their superiority, ...it’s like when someone wants to mark their territory,” one technician said. “i can’t get nervous because they pick up on when someone is secure and when someone is very afraid.”

‘security’ payments

cartels and other criminal groups sometimes demand telecom workers pay ""security payments"" or ""quotas"" in order to perform maintenance on towers and other tasks, according to five contract laborers who have worked on projects involving america movil sab de cv amxl.mx, slim's telecommunications firm, as well as american tower and at&t.

these people said the best strategy is to be polite, stay calm and pay up immediately. those costs get passed along to their employers; laborers for subcontractors said their firms often charge the big telecom companies higher rates for working in dicey areas.

a spokesman for america movil and telesites declined to comment. axtel, which sold some of its telecom towers in 2017, said it had not received any reports of incidents on its remaining infrastructure. at&t said that “under no circumstances” does it “tolerate or authorize payments outside of those established by law.”

an american tower spokesman said “we have not received any credible reports” of parasite antennas or other cartel activities at the company’s mexican sites. he said the firm alerts local authorities immediately if a site is vandalized, and that “the safety of those who work on our towers, as well as the towers’ continued secure operation, are our top priorities.”

guillermo ramos, telefonica’s director of security in mexico, said the company has not received any reports of parasite antennas over at least the past year.

narco-antennas are just one aspect of telecom companies’ headaches in mexico. criminals raid their infrastructure for batteries and copper cables to resell on the black market, executives in the sector told reuters.

stories like this are unfolding in industries across mexico as criminal groups branch out far beyond drugs. cartels have siphoned millions of dollars’ worth of fuel from mexican state oil company petróleos mexicanos or pemex in recent years; they steal cargo and pilfer lumber. the tentacles of organized crime extend even into mexico’s avocado growing regions, where gangs extort farmers and hijack loads of the green fruit.

mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador took office in 2018 advocating a softer approach to his predecessors’ war on drugs with the motto “hugs, not bullets.” the cartels’ encroachment on legitimate businesses did not start on his watch. but the change in strategy has left companies with nowhere to turn, said mike vigil, a former chief of international operations for the u.s. drug enforcement administration (dea).

“lopez obrador has sent a message to all of mexico, including the private sector... that he doesn’t want a confrontational situation with the cartels,” vigil said. “telecom companies are caught between a rock and a hard spot.”

lopez obrador’s office did not respond to requests for comment. the president previously has insisted that mexico must tackle poverty and other factors that drive crime, in addition to using law enforcement.

“we must continue confronting organized crime... there is no longer protection for anyone, as there was before,” lopez obrador said in early june. “we are committed to achieving peace and we have made progress in combating, in reducing, crime.”

an old-school tool

radios are an indispensable tool for cartels and part of their lore. one classic narco-ballad or “corrido” celebrating the notorious zetas syndicate depicts members speaking over their two-way handsets.

when it comes to communicating in real-time with large groups, radio is tough to beat. these networks are often encrypted and, unlike cellular networks, the location of someone using a radio can’t easily be pinpointed, said paul craine, a former director of the dea’s operations in mexico and central america.

a vast web of antennas is necessary to power those networks, and mexico’s thousands of cellular towers, many tucked away in rural areas, provide ready-made places to install them. craine said he consistently observed cartels latching onto cellular towers while working in mexico from 2012 to 2018.

to a trained eye, cartel equipment sticks out like a sore thumb. at the foot of the tower, criminals place a base station, which generates the radio waves, often tucked into a suitcase or picnic cooler for protection from the sun, according to craine and the technicians who spoke with reuters. higher up they install parasite antennas to project the signal.

gangs typically don’t bother with camouflage. the zetas are particularly brash, craine said. he recalled seeing coolers emblazoned with their logo: the letter z. a former engineer for huawei technologies co, the chinese telecom vendor, told reuters that one of the workers he supervised sent him a photo of a device on a telesites tower in early 2018 with a sign that read: “this antenna belongs to the zetas. if any problems arise, please call…,” followed by a phone number.

cesar funes, a vice president of institutional relations for huawei in latin america, said he had not received any reports of parasite antennas. telesites declined to comment.

the equipment persists on companies’ networks, industry executives and law enforcement experts said, due to the difficulty of rooting out the devices across far-flung towers, and the risks that removal might pose to engineers in the field, many of whom don’t report them out of fear.

telecom companies quietly have acknowledged the cartels’ presence in meetings with mexican government officials. gerardo sanchez henkel, a former director of compliance for telecom regulator ift, told reuters he discussed the issue of parasite antennas regularly in meetings with companies before leaving government in late 2015.

the ift said it did not know whether sanchez henkel had discussed the issue with companies during his time in government.

marco galvan, who was a senior director for telecom trade group gsma in mexico until february, said companies often lamented theft and the presence of unauthorized devices on their towers.

“it was an issue that was frequently cited by all the operators as something that inhibited investment,” he said.

the national association of telecommunications (anatel), a trade group representing players including america movil, at&t and telefonica, said companies it surveyed reported 62 parasite antennas from 2017 through mid-2018, the most current data available. nearly 3,000 batteries were stolen from cell towers over the same period, it said.

anatel ceo gabriel szekely said he had no more information to provide on the phenomenon. he told the mexican newspaper reforma in 2018 it was clear that criminal groups were capitalizing on what companies had built.

“suddenly you find devices that are not yours, they belong to organized crime,” szekely told reforma. “and there are places where they do not even let you in to maintain your own facilities.”

‘gentleman’s agreement’

in the worst criminal hot spots, maintaining towers often comes at a price.

the five telecom workers who told reuters that they or their colleagues had been forced to pay up said those encounters typically involved groups of armed men confronting them at the towers. the workers are sometimes unsure of exactly who they are dealing with. in some parts of rural mexico, self-defense organizations have emerged to fill the vacuum left by the state, with these vigilantes often running elaborate extortion schemes to fund their operations, security analysts said.

two people who work for an at&t subcontractor said there are a number of towers where they routinely pay 500 to 1,000 pesos ($22.34 to $44.67) any day they want to perform maintenance. one of the people estimated the number of towers at 11.

reuters could not independently confirm those payments.

sometimes the demands are larger. in 2017, a group demanded a payment of about $1,000 from subcontractors working on a large project for america movil involving multiple towers, according to an engineer who was involved. the criminals called a representative of huawei, which was overseeing the job, to escalate the threat, the person said.

the engineer said the criminal group was courteous throughout the negotiations, addressing workers as “usted,” a spanish pronoun that conveys respect. the telecom crew had no trouble after they paid.

“it was a gentleman’s agreement,” the engineer said.

america movil declined to comment. reuters could not independently confirm the payment.

that worker said huawei pays subcontractors more to work in high-risk areas, which enabled the crew to recover what it paid. he showed reuters a copy of a contract that included an “allowance for site in dangerous city.” two other subcontractors told reuters that allowance has helped them cover the cost of extortion payments.

funes, the huawei executive, denied the company pays criminal groups for access to its sites, and said huawei does not permit subcontractors to do so either. he said the company sometimes pays higher rates in smaller markets where it is more difficult to find engineers.

a spokesman for huawei said the company could not comment on specific allowances, citing the confidentiality of its contracts with suppliers and employees.

“we will never pay anything that is (beyond) the scope of the contract,” funes said.

rules for survival

technicians who work in dangerous parts of mexico say making nice with drug traffickers is a crucial part of the job.

one subcontractor said traffickers stick close to his crews to ensure workers don’t touch cartel antennas, and to be certain they are not enemies who have come to spy on them.

“you work with a narco-escort,” the subcontractor said.

cartels have kidnapped technicians doing maintenance on cellular towers to make them fix their networks, people working in the sector said. the technicians usually are released after a few days, if not sooner. still, those who spoke with reuters said they live in fear of being forced by traffickers to do such work, lest they be killed for knowing too much, or become targets of authorities or rival criminal groups for being complicit. whenever possible, they said, they downplay their expertise.

after traumatic run-ins with cartels, some technicians refuse to go into the field or have left the industry entirely, people working in the sector said.

one subcontractor estimated that 10 workers, primarily new recruits, quit his company over the past year due to security concerns.

even old hands can run into trouble. in 2016, a technician working for an america movil supplier learned his colleagues had been turned away from a site in a cartel stronghold.

determined to finish the job, the engineer headed to the tower alone. he was quickly surrounded by five men armed with long guns and dressed in clothing bearing the cartel’s initials. they forced him into their vehicle and took him to a house in town, where their boss was waiting.

the engineer said he reverted to his security training, resolving not to show fear. when the cartel boss complained that his antennas had been failing, the captive seized an opening.

“it’s in all our interest that the tower is working,” he recalls saying. “just let us work, and we won’t interfere with your equipment… on the contrary, we’ll check it for you.”

the cartel agreed, driving the engineer back to the tower. he said he re-established service at the tower and made a perfunctory check of the illicit antennas. he tried to head off any requests for additional help, saying he was a supervisor whose technical skills were rusty.

throughout the encounter, the engineer maintained his composure. but when he returned to his hotel room that evening, he said his body shook with such force that he thought he might be having a breakdown.

“in the moment, i was fine, i just trusted in god,” he said. “my nerves got me afterwards.”

the young technician who accidentally disrupted a cartel’s communications at an american tower site told reuters he knows the risk he’s taking. but he said he has a family to support and earns a premium for working in a territory that many peers wouldn’t touch.

after a few years working the area, he said he has established a rapport with gang members, who often let him pass to the job site with little more than a wave hello.

he has learned from his early mistake. now, before he cuts the power, he first connects any parasite antennas to a generator to ensure the cartel’s network keeps humming."

san francisco — san francisco and sacramento have become the latest cities in california to announce that public school students will not return to classrooms when the new term begins because of surges in coronavirus cases and delays in getting test results back.

they join los angeles and san diego, the state’s two largest districts. also not reopening are schools in oakland, long beach, santa ana, san bernardino and others that have chosen to start the new term with digital learning amid strong concerns from teachers unions and public health officials about the safety of staff on school campuses.

state superintendent of public instruction tony thurmond says he expects more districts to announce plans for distance learning.

melbourne, australia — australia’s coronavirus hot spot — victoria state — is reporting a record 317 newly confirmed cases in a day.

the tally for thursday surpassed the state’s previous high of 288 on july 10. the previous one-day australian record was 212 cases set march 28 by new south wales state at the first peak of the pandemic. new south wales reported only 10 new cases thursday.

two men in their 80s died in victoria in the last 24 hours, bringing the national death toll for the pandemic to 113.

victoria’s government is reducing the number of non-urgent surgeries allowed in hospitals to increase beds available for covid-19 patients. state officials had planned to restore hospitals to normal medical services by the end of july before infections began to rise in recent weeks.

victoria chief health officer brett sutton says of the latest case load: “it’s a big number. it needs to turn around.”

seoul, south korea -- south korea has reported 61 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, most of them tied to international arrivals.

the tally reported thursday by the korea centers for disease control and prevention raised the country’s caseload to 13,612 during the pandemic, including 291 deaths. the center says 12,396 people have been released from hospitals while 925 remain in treatment.

officials say 47 of the new cases involved people arriving from overseas. south korea has been requiring two-week quarantines on all passengers arriving from abroad since april. this week, it began requiring foreign nationals arriving from bangladesh, pakistan, kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan to provide health certificates proving they have tested negative for the coronavirus.

harrisburg, pa. — pennsylvania is imposing broad new statewide restrictions on bars and restaurants and larger indoor gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic.

gov. tom wolf said wednesday there has been an “alarming escalation” in new infections.

nightclubs will be shut down, bars must close unless they also offer dine-in meals, and bars and restaurants will be limited to 25% capacity under wolf’s order that takes effect thursday. the order also requires businesses to have their employees work from home to the extent possible.

the new restrictions come more than two months after pennsylvania began reopening its pandemic-battered economy and they risk major backlash in large swaths of the state where covid-19 has largely been kept at bay.

but wolf warns that a “new surge is in the offing” that could eclipse what happened in the spring, when the virus killed thousands and sickened tens of thousands of pennsylvanians. cheyenne, wyo. -- wyoming’s governor and top public health officer are speaking out firmly in support of wearing face masks in public amid an accelerating spread of the coronavirus and doubt among some that masks are necessary.

gov. mark gordon said wednesday that it is important to be “conscientious to one another” and that “there is no constitutional right to go infect somebody else.” gordon had a face mask hanging around his neck during the news conference.

the governor blamed a “casual attitude” about mask wearing and social distancing for wyoming’s growing number of cases and his recent decisions to extend health orders affecting public gatherings through july.

jackson, miss. — mississippi gov. tate reeves says he may set restrictions on bars in hopes of slowing the spread of the coronavirus, but he isn’t revealing any timetable and hasn’t indicated if the rules will be statewide.

the governor commented wednesday after meeting with dr. deborah birx from the white house coronavirus task force. reeves says birx praised the mississippi order that took effect this week requiring people to wear masks in public in 13 of the state’s 82 counties.

the mississippi health department reported that a record 1,099 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of the coronavirus in the state as of tuesday evening. that is up from 664 on june 22.

mississippi has had more than 38,500 confirmed cases of the virus since the pandemic began.

sacramento, calif. — california has reported its second-highest daily total of new coronavirus cases and equaled its second worst day for deaths.

more than 11,000 new cases were recorded by state officials tuesday, a rise of 3.3%. california also recorded 140 deaths, tying a recent tally for its second-highest daily figure.

the number of tests and the rate of those testing positive also rose. the positivity rate over the past two weeks has now topped 7%, while in hard-hit los angeles county with a quarter of california’s population that rate has soared to nearly 10%.

public health director barbara ferrer said wednesday that los angeles county is in “an alarming and dangerous phase” that could overwhelm intensive care units and prompt sweeping closure orders if not reversed.

spokane, wash. — a federal judge has rejected a water park’s challenge to washington gov. jay inslee’s emergency powers as the state responds to the coronavirus pandemic.

the slidewaters water park in chelan sued the governor and the department of labor industries last month, arguing that inslee abused his power in declaring the emergency and that the state’s restrictions were likely to prevent it from opening for the summer.

slidewaters nevertheless opened on june 20 and has remained in operation despite the threat of $10,000 or more in fines from the state.

in ruling against the park wednesday, u.s. district judge thomas rice in spokane returned the case to chelan county superior court for consideration of the state’s counterclaims seeking an order to close slidewaters.

richmond, va. — virginia officials have passed temporary new workplace safety rules designed to protect employees from the coronavirus, becoming the first state to adopt such measures.

the virginia safety and health codes board voted wednesday to approve rules for businesses that include social distancing requirements, notifications for employees when a co-worker has tested positive for the virus and timelines for when employees who recover from the virus can return to work.

business groups said the new rules were an overreach that will add unfair burdens on businesses already struggling with the virus’ economic fallout. labor groups hailed the new rules as crucial to worker safety.

topeka, kan. — kansas’ governor says she will delay the reopening of the state’s k-12 schools for nearly a month until after labor day because of a resurgence in reported coronavirus cases that has given the state its worst weeklong spike since the pandemic began.

democratic gov. laura kelly announced her plans wednesday, only hours after the state board of education approved roughly 1,100 pages of reopening guidelines for local boards of education.

kelly said she will issue an executive order monday to delay reopening of schools until sept. 9 to give the state’s districts time to prepare for the extra health and safety standards. she said she will issue a second order making parts of the state board’s guidelines mandatory.

san francisco — california’s education chief has applauded the state’s two largest school districts, los angeles and san diego, for this week’s decision not to reopen classrooms this fall amid rising coronavirus cases. but tony thurmond says the same rules need not apply in counties with low rates of infection.

in a media briefing, thurmond says that in counties where the number of cases is low, schools could reopen for in-person classes as long as they follow the state’s guidance on physical distancing and wearing face coverings.

helena, mont. — montana gov. steve bullock has issued a directive requiring face coverings at indoor public spaces and at larger outdoor gatherings in counties where four or more people are known to be currently infected with covid-19.

bullock says too many people continue to meet in large gatherings and too few are wearing masks.

montana reported a record 145 additional coronavirus cases on wednesday, bringing the state’s number of known cases to 2,096. bullock’s directive came after several local governments passed or are considering similar measures.

baton rouge, la. — louisiana attorney general jeff landry has issued a legal opinion saying the governor’s statewide mask mandate and bar restrictions to combat the coronavirus outbreak appear to violate louisiana’s constitution.

the republican attorney general issued the assessment wednesday while quarantining after a positive coronavirus test. his legal assessment doesn’t carry the force of law.

democratic gov. john bel edwards’ order requires most people to wear face coverings, limits bars to takeout and delivery and bans gatherings of more than 50 people indoors.

landry wrote that’s “likely unconstitutional and unenforceable.”

“although the mask mandate and the 50-person limit may be good recommendations for personal safety, they may not be enforced with financial or criminal penalties,” landry wrote.

the opinion comes a day after vice president mike pence complimented edwards’ virus response and suggested residents should comply with the regulations.

edwards defended his coronavirus order as well within the scope of his legal authority.

mcmaster says parents need to go back to work and children need to stop falling behind. independently elected state education superintendent molly spearman says she doesn’t support the demand because of the virus spread.

the palmetto state teachers association says the state has to get covid-19 under control before students and teachers can return safely to classrooms.

johannesburg — south africa has surpassed 300,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as the first wave of the pandemic crashes into the african continent.

south africa’s 311,049 cases make up close to half of those across the 54-nation continent.

already shortages of medical oxygen and hospital beds are being reported.

while more than 4,400 deaths in south africa have been attributed to the virus, a report by the south african medical research council says the country had nearly 11,000 excess deaths between may 6 and july 7.

the government this week tightened some restrictions, making face masks mandatory in public places and re-imposing a ban on alcohol sales.

lake zurich, ill. — at least three dozen high school students in northern illinois have tested positive for the covid-19 virus after some attending summer sports camps showed symptoms of the disease.

lake county health officials say investigations and contact tracing of the infections are tied to the camps held last week at lake zurich high school and multiple prior social gatherings.

health officials said health screenings were conducted at the start of the camps on july 6 and some students who showed symptoms were turned away. but other students experienced symptoms during the camps and were sent home. health and school district officials met the next day and decided to close the camps.

pasadena, calif. — organizers have canceled the 2021 rose parade because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on long-range planning for the new year’s tradition and the risk of spreading infections among its huge audience and participants.

the pasadena, california, tournament of roses association said the wednesday decision was put off until organizers were certain that safety restrictions would prevent staging of the 132nd parade.

planning for the rose bowl college football game that traditionally follows the parade is continuing, the association said.

the parade is held every jan. 1 except when new year’s day falls on a sunday and the event is pushed to jan. 2.

orlando, fla. — walt disney world welcomed back visitors to two more theme parks that were shuttered since march because of the coronavirus.

the florida theme park resort reopened epcot and disney’s hollywood studios, completing a rolling opening of disney world’s theme parks that started last weekend with magic kingdom and animal kingdom welcoming back visitors.

the parks were the last of orlando’s major theme parks to reopen. both universal orlando and seaworld orlando opened their doors last month.

all parks require reservations and social distancing. visitors and employees need temperature checks upon entering and must wear masks.

there are no live shows at disney world because the reopening created a labor dispute between disney and its actors and singers."

"Fauci calls White House effort to discredit him 'bizarre,' a mistake",271,hruu5h,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-fauci/fauci-calls-white-house-effort-to-discredit-him-bizarre-a-mistake-idUSKCN24G2RZ,16,1594871986.0,,"washington (reuters) - u.s. infectious disease expert anthony fauci on wednesday called the white house effort to discredit him “bizarre” and urged an end to the divisiveness over the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying “let’s stop this nonsense.”

fauci, who has become a popular and trusted figure during the coronavirus outbreak, came under criticism from president donald trump and some of his republican allies as fauci cautioned against reopening the u.s. economy too soon.

the recent spike in coronavirus infections, primarily in states that were among the earliest to lift coronavirus restrictions, put fauci on a collision course with the white house.

“one of the things that’s part of the problem is the dynamics of the divisiveness that is going on now that it becomes difficult to engage in a dialogue of honest evaluation of what’s gone right and what’s gone wrong,” fauci told the atlantic in an interview.

“we’ve got to own this, reset this and say ok, let’s stop this nonsense and figure out how can we get our control over this now.”

the white house over the weekend distributed a list of statements fauci made early in the pandemic that turned out to be wrong as understanding of the disease developed, according to media reports. trump said this week he valued fauci’s input but did not always agree with him.

“you know, it is a bit bizarre. i don’t really fully understand it,” fauci said in an interview with the atlantic.

he said he believed the people involved in releasing that list, which was misleading because it did not include the entirety of fauci’s statements or other context, are really “taken aback by what a big mistake that was.”

white house tensions with fauci have risen with the decline of trump’s popularity in opinion polls over the president’s handling of the outbreak.

the republican president, who is seeking re-election in november, has been increasingly critical of government health officials and their guidance as a rise in infections threatens the easing of shutdown restrictions across the country. across the country, new cases are now averaging around 60,000 a day.

the white house has denied that fauci has been sidelined. however, white house trade adviser peter navarro wrote a critical opinion piece attacking fauci for having made mistakes.

before departing for a trip to atlanta, trump was asked whether navarro had gone rogue.

“well he made a statement representing himself. he shouldn’t be doing that. no, i have a very good relationship with anthony,” trump said.

fauci told the atlantic: “i can’t explain peter navarro. he’s in a world by himself. so i don’t even want to go there.”

fauci said in a financial times interview last week he had not briefed trump in two months. he said on wednesday his advice is passed onto trump indirectly, via vice president mike pence, who heads the white house coronavirus task force.

in his atlantic interview, fauci recommended the country hit a reset button and acknowledge that things are not going in the right direction. the rising numbers of coronavirus infections show “we’ve got to do better” and states need to get on the same page and work on ways to control the virus.

“so, rather than these games people are playing, let’s focus on that,” fauci said."

police body camera footage of george floyd's final minutes of life show him telling minneapolis police officers that he's claustrophobic and pleading with them not to put him in the back of a squad car.

floyd displays signs of distress as officers try to force him into the back of the vehicle, telling them he can't breathe and volunteering to lie on the ground instead.

the body camera footage from former officers j. alexander kueng and thomas lane was made available for in-person viewings wednesday by hennepin county district court, providing a fuller picture of the fatal arrest.

it's the first time the body camera footage of floyd's killing has been seen, although the court has previously released transcripts of the footage.

""let me see your hands""

kueng and lane arrived at cup foods at 38th street and chicago avenue in south minneapolis shortly after 8 p.m. on memorial day after reports that someone tried to pass counterfeit money.

they briefly talk to the store manager, who points out a truck across the street. lane takes out his flashlight as he crosses 38th street. he taps on the truck's front driver's side window with the flashlight, and floyd is startled.

""let me see your hands,"" lane tells floyd. floyd is moving around in the vehicle and apologizing to the officer, who swears at floyd and demands to see his hands. lane draws his gun and points it at floyd, who tells him that he got shot the ""same way by another police officer before,"" and begs lane not to shoot him, telling the officer that he just lost his mom.

lane tells floyd to get out of the car, pulls floyd's hands behind his back and cuffs him just about two minutes after he'd approached the vehicle.

kueng escorts floyd over to a nearby wall and tells him to sit on the ground while lane interviews the passengers in the truck he was driving. they say they were just getting a ride from floyd.

""i'm not trying to win""

the two officers lead floyd across the street toward the squad car, search his pockets and then try to convince him to sit down in the squad.

floyd tells them that he just got over covid-19, that he's claustrophobic and has anxiety. floyd begs the officers not to put him in the back, at one point telling them he'll get into the squad if they let him count to three.

a man on the street tells floyd, ""you can't win,"" and that he should just get in the car.

floyd responds, ""i'm not trying to win.""

about a minute later, kueng tries to push floyd into the squad while lane pulls him from the other side. floyd is splayed across the back seat, frantic and yelling. at least twice while being forced into the squad, floyd says, ""i can't breathe,"" and tells the officers he'll lie on the ground instead.

officer derek chauvin arrives on lane's side of the car. floyd's body comes out of the car — it's not clear from the video if he's pulled out or pushes himself out — and he goes to the ground near the squad's back tire.

chauvin kneels on his neck, even as bystanders gather and yell that they're killing floyd. floyd calls out ""mama"" repeatedly — his family has said she died about two years ago.

""just leave him""

lane asks multiple times whether they should roll him on his side, but chauvin says to ""just leave him."" kueng checks floyd's pulse, and says ""he can't find one.""

several minutes after chauvin put his knee on floyd's neck, an emt arrives and chauvin gets up.

the officers help the emt get floyd onto a stretcher. lane rides with him in the ambulance for a few blocks, giving floyd chest compressions as emts prepare their treatment. the officer later gets a ride back to 38th street and chicago avenue in a fire truck.

chauvin's body camera had come loose as he restrained floyd on the ground. kueng recovered it from under the squad.

after the ambulance drives floyd's body away, kueng takes a report from the store owner about the counterfeit $20 bill. as a crowd begins to gather outside the store, the manager tells kueng, ""people are silly. i don't know why they're messing with you.""

kueng asks chauvin for an evidence envelope for the counterfeit bill. chauvin asks whether floyd was in the vehicle police were securing.

Why It Took So Long For Politicians To Treat The Child Care Crisis As A Crisis,186,hsacrg,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-it-took-so-long-for-politicians-to-treat-the-child-care-crisis-as-a-crisis/,22,1594937587.0,,"america is a little matryoshka doll of panic right now; pop open each layer to reveal a new, worrying scenario. for months the country was focused on reopening the economy, which had its own complicated set of problems. but only recently has a broader swath of america tuned into the mess nestled inside it, one that parents have been sitting with for months: what to do with the kids.

there has been no federal plan to help american parents with child care, and they continue to wonder whether schools will really open their doors come the new school year. that lack of action is in direct contrast to other crises that have struck america recently. after the financial crash of 2008, there was a bailout and a stimulus plan. after the protests against police over the last few months, officials in cities and states responded with promises of better actions in the future but also, immediate policy implementation: new york state repealed a law that had shielded police personnel files, while the minneapolis city council voted to begin a process that could eventually lead to the dissolution of the city police as it’s now known.

[related: where the latest covid-19 models think we’re headed — and why they disagree]

but on child care and school, a specific, urgent response has been missing, or at least one that acknowledges our new reality. president trump threatened to withhold federal funding for education if schools didn’t open back up, counter to schools’ insistence they need more money to provide a safe education amid the pandemic. while the cares act, an omnibus covid-19 relief bill signed into law in late march, gave extra stimulus funding to families with children, schools and child care businesses so they could remain afloat, a democratic-backed bill to give a $50 billion bailout of the child care industry has gotten little attention. teachers around the country have voiced doubt that necessary safety measures for in-school teaching will be sufficient, and los angeles unified school district, one of the country’s largest school systems, has decided not to reopen classrooms when schools go back in session in august. some worry that while distance learning is safer, socially different children and those without stable internet connections or computers — who are already at the margins in normal times — will fall irrevocably behind.

there is no cohesive solution to america’s child care problem. but the relative inattention to this crisis, one that’s so foundational to a functioning society, the economy and family units across the country, is revealing. it shows that for all the changes that have happened in american life — more female elected officials, a metoo movement and a workforce that is around 47 percent female — our power dynamics remain fundamentally skewed. we are failing to collectively understand what our most critical and pressing problems actually are.

“care in general has always been seen as a sideline issue,” vicki shabo of the left-leaning think tank new america said. “a nice-to-have and not something that’s necessary, and not something that’s central for adults to be productive in the economy.” of course, now we’re seeing how much of a misunderstanding that is. in a country where most men and women work even when they have children, having child care is inextricably linked to economic productivity — and not having it often hurts women most. u.s. bureau of labor statistics data from 2015 found that in households with children under 6, women spent an hour a day doing child care, compared to the 25 minutes of care provided by men. it’s easy to extrapolate this trend for pandemic times: american women will bear the brunt of the school and child care crisis.





fivethirtyeight politics podcast: covid-19 deaths are rising. what will the u.s. do?

yet, child care in particular hasn’t often found itself at the forefront of political debate. experts and activists i talked to for this story all used the same framing to talk about why: an american narrative that child care problems are individuals’ problems, not society’s.

“if you think about child care traditionally before the pandemic, you probably didn’t think about it too much before you had kids,” melissa boteach, vice president of income security and child care at the national women’s law center, said. “then you have kids, you’re in the most stressful and resource-strapped part of your life: you’re operating on three hours of sleep a night, you’re financially squeezed, because at the very time you’re taking off of work, you have diapers and wipes and formula and whatever else. you’re in this total daze of early motherhood. that’s probably not the time when you say, ‘you know what, i’m going to call my member of congress.’ you’re feeling it like a personal issue.”

child care isn’t necessarily seen as a macroeconomic issue or a driver of labor force participation or gdp, shabo said. and because of that, she said, it often takes a backseat to economic issues like wages when lobbying efforts happen. this is not to say that child care issues don’t get attention — in the 2020 democratic presidential primaries, which featured several female candidates, child care plans took a more front and center role in the campaign than they had in the past. one leading candidate, sen. elizabeth warren, co-authored a 2004 book, “the two-income trap,” which was about the ways the rising incomes of households with two full-time employed adults belied the heavy costs of essentials like child care. warren thought child care costs were among the reasons the american middle class was in an economic crisis.

“our workplaces were built for white men,” said danielle atkinson, the founder and director of mothering justice, a detroit-area advocacy group for working families. the fact that parents are left to fend for themselves from birth to kindergarten and then during the after-school, pre-dinner hours, is an american tradition that seems to assume a readily available, at-home caregiver. (atkinson pointed out the inextricable role black women have played in american child care; enslaved women often took care of white children.) the nuclear family with a stay-at-home parent (usually a mother) is an ideal that persists, or at the very least lingers in american life: only 18 percent of americans in a 2018 pew research survey thought it was ideal for both parents to work full time.

“this conversation about school is really a conversation about work,” atkinson said. “the conversation about returning to school is not based on health. it’s about returning those workers to working and not looking after their children, so those children have to be somewhere.” essential workers in particular are being forced to make difficult choices about their children’s care — many essential-worker jobs are lower wage — and many child care providers are in strapped situations. the work of child care providers, atkinson said, is often undervalued — their median annual wage in 2017 was a little more than $22,000 annually, which is just above the federal government’s poverty line for a family of three — and as boteach pointed out, those workers could continue to risk greater infection rates as schools and work open back up. she highlighted the plan put forth by senate democrats, the child care is essential act — which would provide a bailout to the suffering industry and additional money for those providers to buy personal protective equipment — and cited an estimate that the u.s. child care industry would need a $9.6 billion injection monthly to survive the pandemic.

it’s more likely the next governmental nod to parents and their school-age children will come in the next iteration of the omnibus coronavirus relief package. congressional democrats have proposed $350 billion in funds for schools and universities to purchase ppe and clean their facilities. republicans agree about more funds, though it’s not clear what their proposed number is — some have argued that since many schools will be operating on a partly virtual basis, less federal funding is needed.

the moral tussling that many parents have been doing — go back to work and risk potential covid-19 infection at day care or school — will likely continue to be subjected to partisan politics. trump and his secretary of education betsy devos have been the loudest voices in recent days about sending children back to school at all costs, much to the chagrin of teachers, many of whom feel ill-prepared for the safety precautions necessary for in-person pandemic teaching. ultimately, though, it is parents who are forced to make a choice. atkinson, a mother of six, told me she would be keeping her children home in the fall.

for those who focus on child care, the pandemic has perversely presented an opportunity to advance the cause of greater access to guaranteed services. “this pandemic has created greater alignment of experience, potentially, between white middle class folks who saw this as an individual issue that they were struggling with and outraged by but hadn’t really taken action on and the longtime, long-standing lived experience of lower wage folks and people of color who have struggled for decades with the unaffordability of child care and the lack of care options to meet their work schedules,” shabo said.

atkinson said she also hoped the individualism narrative would be shattered by the current crisis. “we want to lift the veil away and help women, especially white women, know that you’ve been lied to. you were sold a bunch of lies: ‘if you just work harder, if you just slay sexism, you’ll be ok.’ but really, it’s a tool to divide,” she said.

the pandemic has shattered norms and paradigms ever since it arrived in the u.s. — our expectations of child care is no exception. what some politicians and activists had long sought to do to no avail — place working parents and their child care crisis on the center stage of american politics — the virus has done in a matter of months."

glen jean, w.va. (ap) — the boy scouts of america have postponed next year’s national jamboree in west virginia, citing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.

the increasing number of cases and the pandemic’s persistence and unpredictability made it impossible for the boy scouts to comply with its “be prepared” motto, according to an announcement on the organization’s website.

the quadrennial jamboree had been scheduled for july 21-30, 2021 at the scouts’ summit bechtel site. nearly 40,000 scouts attended the 2017 event, and president donald trump gave a controversial speech there.

“planning, preparations and decisions regarding national jamborees take place months, and even years, in advance,” the scouts explained. “given the current situation and the uncertain nature of future conditions, we determined we could not prepare in a manner that would provide the safest possible environment for all those involved.”

a task force will be appointed to recommend a new date, the organization said."
Protests in Michigan after student jailed for not doing online schoolwork,294,hsjsqx,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-detention/protests-in-michigan-after-student-jailed-for-not-doing-online-schoolwork-idUSKCN24H38Q,16,1594967085.0,,"pontiac, michigan (reuters) - hundreds of detroit-area students turned out in protest outside their high school thursday calling for the release of a classmate who is in juvenile detention after not completing schoolwork during remote learning this past semester.

the 15-year-old student, called grace in the original propublica report that highlighted her situation, was on probation for fighting with her mother and stealing. propublica reported that grace, who has attention deficit disorder, was easily distracted when studying at home and fell behind during remote learning. a michigan circuit court judge sent grace to juvenile detention in may, citing the schoolwork as a probation violation.

on thursday afternoon, protesters assembled at groves high school in the suburb of beverley hills before they drove to the oakland county’s circuit court and prosecutor’s office holding up signs with calls to “free grace.”

students at the demonstration told reuters grace’s academic performance was not unique as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.

“a lot of people were behind on their work this semester, no one had motivation to do anything because the teachers weren’t teaching and we were all online. i know so many people that didn’t do their homework,” said prudence canter, 18, a graduating senior at the school.

“it didn’t seem like the judge or the caseworker knew how grades and due dates and things were structured during the pandemic shutdown in the spring,” geoff wickersham, a social studies teacher at grove, told reuters at the protest. “i think this is a huge injustice.”

speakers asked protesters to raise their hands if they had ever failed to turn in an assignment at some point and every person raised their hands.

the prosecutor’s office declined to comment. judge mary ellen brennan, who handed down the ruling, was not immediately available for comment.

oakland county executive david coulter posted a statement online tuesday night, writing that he had spoken to the judge.

“while there are many more details that she is unable to share with me and the public to protect privacy of the minor and their family, i believe a review of this case within her court or during an appellate process is required,” coulter wrote.

congressional representative andy levin wrote online that children should not be locked up for not doing their homework.

“the prosecution’s only witness was unaware of the student’s learning disabilities. witnesses who could have provided a better understanding of the situation, like the student’s teachers, were unable to testify,” levin wrote.

"In historic move, Asheville approves reparations for Black residents",43,hstslg,https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/07/14/asheville-passes-reparations-black-residents-historic/5438597002/,63,1595012924.0,[deleted],"close asheville city council met tuesday to discuss the removal of confederate monuments and police funding asheville citizen times

asheville - in an extraordinary move, the city council has apologized for the city's historic role in slavery, discrimination and denial of basic liberties to black residents and voted to provide reparations to them and their descendants.

the 7-0 vote came the night of july 14.

""hundreds of years of black blood spilled that basically fills the cup we drink from today,"" said councilman keith young, one of two african american members of the body and the measure's chief proponent.

""it is simply not enough to remove statues. black people in this country are dealing with issues that are systemic in nature,"" young said.

the unanimously passed resolution does not mandate direct payments. instead it will make investments in areas where black residents face disparities.

""the resulting budgetary and programmatic priorities may include but not be limited to increasing minority home ownership and access to other affordable housing, increasing minority business ownership and career opportunities, strategies to grow equity and generational wealth, closing the gaps in health care, education, employment and pay, neighborhood safety and fairness within criminal justice,"" the resolution reads.

the resolution calls on the city to create the community reparations commission, inviting community groups and other local governments to join. it will be the commission's job to make concrete recommendations for programs and resources to be used.

councilwoman sheneika smith, who is black, said the council had gotten emails from those ""asking, 'why should we pay for what happened during slavery?'""

""(slavery) is this institution that serves as the starting point for the building of the strong economic floor for white america, while attempting to keep blacks subordinate forever to its progress,"" said smith.

councilman vijay kapoor who has often split with young and smith on police and budget issues said he supported the measure for moral reasons. but he said skeptics could look to the ""practical reason"": data showing showing large disparities between african americans and other asheville residents.

""we don't want to be held back by these gaps,"" kapoor said. ""we want everyone to be successful.""

the council allowed an hour of public comment on the measure. many who were not able to speak before the vote waited for another hour-long comment period afterward, pushing the meeting late into the night. most were in support.

rob thomas, community liaison for the racial justice coalition which led the push for reparations, thanked the council.

""this is a really, really good gesture as far as the foundation of what we can build. the potential of what can come out of this document is amazing.""

increasing generational wealth — something african americans were deprived of through economic and regulatory discrimination — should be the focus, he said.

it was also important that buncombe county's government join, thomas said, to ensure issues weren't lost between the county and city.

the county's board of commissioners which governs all of buncombe including municipal residents is not clearly behind the reparations measure though it has a 4-3 democratic majority.

a few callers spoke against reparations, one linking it to a venezuelan government plot and others saying black lives matter was marxist.

""my white privilege is i grew up on a farm, we milked cows, we bailed hay. that was my white privilege,"" said a man identifying himself as eddy from west asheville.

but david greenson said white people like him needed black people to get reparations ""because our souls are in jeopardy.""

""i am responsible for the beating of johnnie rush in august of 2017,"" he said referencing the infamous beating of an unarmed black asheville pedestrian by a police officer. ""i may not have hit him or tased him or choked him, but i paid the man who did.""

washington (ap) — secretary of state mike pompeo argued thursday for a more limited u.s. view of global human rights advocacy based on the principals laid out by america’s founding fathers, a suggestion critics assumed meant stepping away from more modern concepts such as support for women and the lgbqt communities around the world.

pompeo, speaking in philadelphia, singled out property rights and religious freedom as “foremost” principals in a speech that elsewhere complained about the “proliferation” of protections in international agreements related to human rights.

“we are forced to grapple with tough choices about which rights to promote and how to think about this,” he said. “americans have not only unalienable rights, but also positive rights granted by governments, courts and multilateral bodies. many are worth defending in light of our founding; others aren’t.”

pompeo on thursday released a report produced by the commission on unalienable rights, which he tasked last year with conducting a broad review of u.s. human rights policy, arguing at the time that it had “lost its bearings.”

before its release, many human rights groups were skeptical of the commission, whose chairwoman was conservative legal scholar mary ann glendon, a former u.s. ambassador to the holy see.

pompeo noted that the report emphasizes property rights and religious liberty. “no one can enjoy the pursuit of happiness if you cannot own the fruits of your own labor. and no society can retain its legitimacy or a virtuous character without religious freedom,” he said.

the report did not produce any specific recommendations and steered clear of endorsing policy proposals. but experts who parsed it for direction noted, for example, that it referred to abortion and same-sex marriage not as rights but “divisive social and political controversies.”

critics such as sen. bob menendez, the ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee, said the report would damage the united states’ reputation as a champion of human rights around the world by narrowing the scope of who deserves protection.

“as feared, secretary pompeo used his speech to insinuate a hierarchy of rights where property rights and religious liberty are ‘foremost’ rights and some rights are not ‘worth defending,”’ said the new jersey democrat.

critics also faulted the makeup of the commission, saying it was weighted with conservatives, and the public did not have sufficient opportunity to weigh in on its findings before the report’s release.

“as was clear from the start, secretary pompeo’s commission on unalienable rights was designed to challenge the international consensus with a narrow view of human rights, that among other things would leave lgbtq people even more vulnerable to violence and discrimination,” said david stacy, government affairs director of human rights campaign.

pompeo also took aim in his speech at demonstrators “pulling down statues” and “desecrating monuments,” in echoes of president donald trump’s recent speech at mount rushmore. the secretary of state said it was an attack on the people who fought for the rights laid out in the declaration of independence.

he also criticized the new york times for its 1619 project, an award-winning explanation of the persistent legacy of slavery in the united states.

“america is fundamentally good and has much to offer the world because our founders recognized the existence of god-given unalienable rights and designed a durable system to protect them,” he said. “but these days i must say even saying america is fundamentally good has become controversial.”"

new york (ap) — former middle school principal jamaal bowman has toppled 16-term u.s. rep. eliot engel in new york’s democratic primary in another upset victory for the party’s insurgent wing.

a political novice who has never held public office before, bowman, 44, was a progressive african american challenger who said engel, the 73-year-old chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, had lost touch with his economically and racially diverse district.

bowman declared victory in the race on june 24, a day after the primary election. the associated press was able to call the race friday after obtaining an absentee vote count that showed engel narrowly ahead among votes received by mail, but not by nearly the margin necessary to overcome bowman’s election day advantage.

“the numbers are clear, and i will not be the democratic nominee for the 16th congressional district seat in the fall election,” engel said. “serving the people of the bronx and westchester in congress has been the greatest privilege of my life, and what a remarkable 32 years it has been.”

bowman earned his extraordinary win in a campaign season upended first by the coronavirus outbreak, then by protests over the death of george floyd.

“i’m a black man who was raised by a single mother in a housing project. that story doesn’t usually end in congress. but today, that 11-year old boy who was beaten by police is about to be your next representative,” bowman said in a statement. bowman said his campaign was anchored in the fight for racial and economic justice “and it resonated in every part of the district.”

alexandra rojas, executive director of justice democrats, a progressive organization that backed bowman, said in a statement, “this win proves that a black man who survived poverty and police violence at 11 years old has the power to transform his community and country.”

both candidates were unable to do traditional campaigning because of social distancing restrictions, but bowman criticized engel for staying at his home in maryland as the pandemic turned his district in the bronx and suburban westchester county into one of the virus’s most deadly hunting grounds.

engel said he was working on behalf of the district from washington.

then, after protests over floyd’s death in minnesota gave way to two nights of looting, engel had a bad gaffe while appearing at a bronx event where he joined other local politicians appealing for peace.

“if i didn’t have a primary, i wouldn’t care,” he said while pleading with the lead organizer for a chance to speak, in a comment picked up by a live microphone.

engel, who is white, said he has “always believed that black lives matter” and said his comments were taken out of context, but bowman, who has spoken of his own experiences with police brutality, said they illustrated why the district needed new leadership.

by defeating engel, bowman replicated the success of democratic socialist alexandria ocasio-cortez, who defeated another powerful new york city democrat, joe crowley, in a neighboring congressional district two years ago.

the ap called the race after obtaining the absentee vote count from westchester county. votes cast by mail in the bronx have yet to be released, but an ap analysis of absentee ballots counted so far indicated that bowman’s lead from votes cast in person is too large for engel to overcome.

engel wished bowman well in a statement released through a spokesman and said the district desperately needs resources from washington “and we must continue to fight for them.”

the campaign was the latest proxy battle between the party’s progressive and pragmatic wings. bowman was endorsed by ocasio-cortez and u.s. sens. bernie sanders and elizabeth warren while engel picked up support from hillary clinton and u.s. sen. charles schumer.

bowman grew up in public housing in new york city. he was a teacher and school counselor for several years before becoming the founding principal of a bronx middle school, the cornerstone academy for social action.

candidates chris fink, sammy ravelo and andom ghebreghiorgis also appeared on the ballot, although ghebreghiorgis withdrew from the race and endorsed bowman.

the district is heavily democratic, so the primary winner is virtually assured of victory in the general election in november."
What Fiona Hill Learned in the White House,27,ht7wcf,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/29/what-fiona-hill-learned-in-the-white-house,4,1595063285.0,,"two weeks later, putin easily won another term as president, in an election that was widely condemned as fraudulent. as hill’s staff assembled the briefing materials for a call between trump and putin to discuss syria and north korea, the state department requested that mcmaster instruct trump not to congratulate putin. hill and mcmaster did not pass the request on to trump. “it would just make him do it even more adamantly, because he’s reflexively contrarian,” a former official told me. later, the washington post reported that trump had not followed “specific warnings from his national security advisers,” including “a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating ‘do not congratulate.’ ” predictably, trump was furious with mcmaster, and hill surmised that an official with access to the briefing materials had set him up. “we were all being used again, us and you guys in the press, by those who wanted h.r. to be fired,” she told me. hill offered to quit in solidarity if he was let go, but he said that she should stay in the job to insure a smooth transition. a few days later, trump fired mcmaster and hired john bolton, a foreign-policy hawk, as national-security adviser.

on july 15th, bolton, kelly, and hill flew to helsinki on air force one, for an arms-control summit between trump and putin. hill knew that trump wouldn’t read the materials she had prepared, but she hoped that he might sit through an oral briefing. trump wasn’t interested. he, putin, and the translators met in the finnish presidential palace. putin, familiar with u.s. policy and with trump’s habits, brought notes on topics to address. notes had been prepared for trump, but they were of limited use. after the two presidents met, a group of senior officials asked trump to tell them about the conversation. “he didn’t want to share,” the former white house official said. “his mind-set was: this is between me and my friend.”

later, at a lunch, trump invited putin to share what he’d said in their private meeting. putin referred to a proposal he’d made, to use an existing mutual-legal-assistance treaty that would allow american law-enforcement officials to be present for interviews with the russian intelligence officers who had been charged with election interference. at a post-summit press conference, putin elaborated: he would make the indicted officers available if trump allowed russian law-enforcement officers to be present during the questioning of american officials in cases of interest to putin.

hill was again struck by putin’s craftiness and gall. “my head was full of expletives,” she said. “putin was setting us all up.” he knew that the u.s. would never allow the russians to question american officials. “it was a distraction. he’s shouting, ‘fire! look over there!,’ deflecting from what russia had done in 2016.” at the press conference, trump made it clear that he believed putin’s denials of election meddling, and called his proposal “an incredible offer.” hill recalled, “i just sat there and thought, maybe i should just fall over backwards onto the media behind me and fake a medical emergency just to stop this agony.”

state department officials immediately rejected the proposal, but, on july 17th, russia’s prosecutor general’s office announced that it was seeking to interview eleven u.s. intelligence officers, businessmen, and diplomats, including michael mcfaul, the former u.s. ambassador to russia. mcfaul, an outspoken critic of trump, had recently published a memoir, “from cold war to hot peace: an american ambassador in putin’s russia.” apparently seeking reassurance that he wasn’t in jeopardy, he asked to talk to hill, and she agreed to see him. he told the washington post about the planned meeting, and one of bolton’s deputies at the n.s.c. accused her of disloyalty.

critics of trump’s behavior at helsinki were unhappy with hill, too. some members of the obama administration thought that she had become little more than a “beard” for the president. one of them told a member of hill’s team that she thought that hill and her staff had become “collaborators” and “would end up going to jail for aiding and abetting a criminal.” hill told me, “everybody thought that there was this deep, satisfying conspiracy in helsinki.” the press conference had been embarrassing, but she didn’t think she needed to resign over it. “there were no secret deals. this is not ‘the manchurian candidate.’ if there was something that i felt was really egregious, i would have quit.”

bolton and hill developed a close working relationship. he respected her opinions and trusted her to carry out his instructions. but he never included her or her colleagues in meetings with trump, and hill generally attended oval office meetings on russia only when jon huntsman, the u.s. ambassador, was visiting. in those sessions, trump had little interest in hearing the ambassador’s thoughts about putin, preferring to talk about huntsman’s daughter, abby, who was then the co-host of “fox & friends weekend.” “let’s call abby!” trump said on one occasion. “get her on the phone!”

difficult conversations with putin were left to the president’s advisers, including bolton and hill. this was less than ideal, since putin understood that they did not necessarily have the backing of the president. as the 2018 midterm elections approached, hill accompanied bolton to a meeting in moscow at which bolton warned putin that meddling would not be tolerated. putin, according to someone at the meeting, responded, “we understand that there are all sorts of people who interfere in elections, such as george soros.” as putin said the name soros, he looked at hill. she recalled, “i just returned the gaze, and i may have slightly raised an eyebrow to make it a hard stare back.” it was hill’s fifty-third birthday, and on the flight home bolton and other officials gathered for a toast and laughed about the soros moment.

on september 5th, the times published an op-ed by an anonymous senior official who claimed to be a member of a group “working diligently from within” trump’s administration “to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.” hill told me that several u.s. ambassadors warned her that rick grenell, the u.s. ambassador to germany, who was a trump favorite, was “gunning for her” and spreading a rumor that she was the op-ed’s author. the former national-security official told me, “fiona was one of the top people on grenell’s hit list.” on one phone call, hill said, grenell told her that she was “not part of the team.” (grenell disputes this version of events.) in fact, hill told me, she had been angered by the op-ed, which exacerbated distrust within the government. “i thought it was meant to make the author feel better to themselves about what they were doing,” she said. hill believed that her role was to insure that decisions by policymakers were evaluated through the appropriate channels. she promised herself that if she ever learned of something improper or illegal she would alert bolton and the administration’s lawyers. “i would never have done anything anonymously,” she said.

hill sometimes suggested to me that her time in the white house might have gone differently had she understood that her real challenge was in dealing not with putin but with the americans who sought to influence trump. “there’s the irony,” she said. “i know the intrigue in russia better than the intrigue at home.” in early 2019, she learned that the ukrainian president, petro poroshenko, who was worried that volodymyr ze​lensky was surging in the polls, was passing messages to american officials, asking what it would take to get trump’s support in the ukrainian election. u.s. officials told poroshenko that the administration would not get involved. hill had no idea that rudolph giuliani, trump’s personal lawyer, was conducting his own private diplomatic schemes on behalf of the president.

hill had planned to return to brookings by april, 2019, but, at bolton’s request, she agreed to stay through mid-july, when tim morrison, who oversaw arms control at the n.s.c., would succeed her. in april, hill met with ukrainian energy officials, including andriy kobolyev, the c.e.o. of naftogaz, ukraine’s national gas-and-oil company, and his deputy, andrew favorov, to discuss a plan to buy from the u.s. large quantities of liquefied natural gas to tide the country over in the event that russia cut off its supply. the ukrainian delegation did not mention that they were about to meet with lev parnas and igor fruman, two ukrainian-american business associates of giuliani, and tommy hicks, a wealthy private investor and a close friend of donald trump, jr. favorov told me that hill “just knew her shit.” by contrast, the meeting with giuliani’s associates, which took place at the trump international hotel in washington, was “dark and shady, like we were in some movie about corruption in d.c.”

in april, zelensky won the election in a landslide. hill heard that marie yovanovitch, the u.s. ambassador to ukraine, had been asked to return to washington. on may 1st, she met yovanovitch at greenberry’s coffee, near the state department. yovanovitch, one of the most respected and experienced ambassadors in the department, was clearly “rattled.” she told hill that she didn’t know why she had been recalled. hill, increasingly aware that she herself was being sidelined, soon discovered that gordon sondland, an ambitious hotel magnate who, in 2018, became the u.s. ambassador to the e.u., had begun to insert himself into discussions about ukraine, even though it isn’t part of the bloc. later that month, when the white house compiled a guest list of u.s. officials who would attend zelensky’s inauguration, in kyiv, sondland successfully lobbied to have his name added, according to officials. (sondland denies having lobbied for the invitation.) alexander vindman, the ukraine specialist in hill’s directorate, attended on behalf of the n.s.c. according to a former obama administration official, hill saw “that she was being swindled, managed, handled, and ignored. she thought she was at the center of the ukraine policy and realized that she wasn’t.”

on may 22nd, two days after the inauguration, hill met with amos hochstein, a former obama administration official who was working closely with kobolyev. hochstein told hill that he had recently met with zelensky and other officials in kyiv. giuliani, he said, was pressuring the ukrainians to launch an investigation into joe biden. giuliani and his business associates were pushing a spurious narrative about biden, claiming that he had engineered the firing of ukraine’s prosecutor general to protect his son hunter, who was on the board of the gas company burisma. it was giuliani, hill later learned, who had orchestrated yovanovitch’s dismissal. “amos knew so much more than i did,” hill recalled. “he kept talking—‘burisma, burisma.’ i was, like, ‘what? burisma?’ he was, like, ‘the hunter thing.’ ”

later that month, hill discovered that she had been excluded from another set of communications, about viktor orbán’s long-hoped-for meeting with trump. mick mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, had known orbán for several years, and had advocated for the two to meet. a former u.s. diplomat said that, in the meeting, orbán had reinforced trump’s negative views about ukraine. trump told reporters, “viktor orbán has done a tremendous job in so many different ways. highly respected. respected all over europe.”

on july 10th, two of zelensky’s top advisers were in washington, trying to schedule a meeting with trump. bolton did not want to commit, but sondland, who was still injecting himself into conversations about ukraine, told bolton that mulvaney had already arranged it. bolton asked hill to attend a discussion between sondland and the ukrainian delegation. hill told bolton that she learned, in the discussion, that sondland and mulvaney had made zelensky’s visit to the white house contingent upon ukraine’s agreement to pursue investigations. she later informed the n.s.c.’s legal adviser that sondland and mulvaney had bypassed the n.s.c. (under oath, sondland said that he had no recollection of such an agreement. mulvaney has denied pressuring ukraine to investigate the bidens.) when hill learned that the group was considering a phone call between trump and zelensky, she cautioned bolton and his deputies against it.

as planned, hill ended her tenure at the white house on july 15th. two days later, in her farewell toast, she referred to j. r. r. tolkien’s “lord of the rings” trilogy; her “band of brothers” at the n.s.c. was now passing “the ring” to the next group. shortly before leaving, she encountered sondland, who told her that he was coördinating with trump and mulvaney, and gave her a friendly farewell hug. “gordon, i think this is all going to blow up,” she recalls saying. (sondland denies that this conversation took place.)

hill, who remained on the payroll through august, continued to receive unclassified e-mails, including ones about the trump-zelensky phone call, which took place on july 25th. as she put it, “i had gleaned from a couple of these exchanges that maybe the call hadn’t been great.” in september, she visited her mother in bishop auckland, and so did not learn the details of the phone call until september 24th, when the white house released a summary of the call. it revealed that zelensky had asked trump for “more javelins” and that trump had asked zelensky to investigate hunter biden. later that day, nancy pelosi announced that the house of representatives would launch a formal impeachment inquiry.

the house intelligence committee, led by adam schiff, democrat of california, drew up a list of witnesses that included bolton, hill, mulvaney, sondland, yovanovitch, and kurt volker, the former special envoy to ukraine. volker, the first witness, appeared voluntarily before the committee less than a week after resigning. the white house had told bolton that he could not testify, and the democrats on the committee, aware that a court fight over a subpoena would drag on for months, dropped efforts to compel him to appear. hill insisted on being subpoenaed, and delivered her private deposition on october 14th. before her closed-door appearance, she again began receiving death threats. an f.b.i. officer who had worked with her recommended that she tape shut her mail slot and put security cameras around her house. still, hill welcomed the chance to testify. “i was given my opportunity for a clarifying moment,” she said.

the dynamics during hill’s private deposition, she said, reminded her of high school. matt gaetz, a florida republican, showed up uninvited at the hearing as a kind of protest against the impeachment inquiry, and engaged in “some absurd staring contest” with her. she was disturbed that her republican questioners insisted on repeating the false theory that ukraine had interfered in the election. she also sensed that they were trying to link her to christopher steele and his dossier. hill told them that the dossier was a “rabbit hole”—which upset steele, who had considered hill a friend. derek harvey, who had been made an adviser to the house intelligence committee’s ranking republican, devin nunes, passed notes to the republican questioner stephen castor, whom hill heard laughing while she described the lies that had been spread about her. (when castor was called out during the deposition, he insisted that he had not laughed.) during a break, harvey told hill that he’d heard that the “trolls” were coming after her again.

hill’s public testimony took place on november 21st. congressional hearings are typically dry affairs, followed mostly by lobbyists, political junkies, and retirees addicted to c-span. but, when washington is in the throes of a political scandal, a hearing can be riveting. in 1973, john dean, richard nixon’s former white house counsel, testified for five days before the watergate committee. he surmised that he had been recorded in the oval office, a statement that led to revelations that nixon had secret tapes of his meetings. in june, 2017, james comey told the senate intelligence committee that trump had asked him “what we could do to ‘lift the cloud’ ” of the russia investigation. trump had implied on twitter that he had tapes of at least one of his encounters with comey, prompting comey to say, “lordy, i hope there are tapes.”

hill, conveying a clear sense of the absurdity of the events she had witnessed, gave a brief opening statement, in which she pledged her loyalty to a country that had afforded her opportunities that would not have been available to her in the u.k., given her background and accent. sondland had testified the previous day that he, volker, and rick perry, the former energy secretary, had not wanted to deal with giuliani but were “playing the hand we were dealt.” hill described sondland and his associates as having been involved in a “domestic political errand.”

kelly, who had left the administration at the end of 2018, and mcmaster, who had taken a position at stanford, had said little publicly about trump, and they told hill they admired her fortitude. bolton, who was fired in september, 2019, had decided to save his revelations for a memoir. after hill’s testimony, he asked sarah tinsley, a longtime aide, to relay a personal message: “you did the right thing.” on march 1st, hill received an e-mail from james mattis, the former secretary of defense: “i’ve wanted to drop you a note paying my respects but hesitated in the immediate aftermath of your testimony to ask around for your email address. had word leaked out that i wanted to be in touch i imagined it could/would have been misconstrued and add to the challenges you were dealing with.” he went on, “i doubt that i’ve ever felt the combination of pride, anger and contempt as i watched you testify and what followed. i was enormously proud of your demonstrated courage and poise as you stood tall; angry at those who chose to try to defame you (they failed); and contemptuous of what we witnessed in those weeks by supposed political leaders whose hear no evil, see no evil stance revealed profiles in non-courage.”

in the end, hill said, the impeachment “came down to political mud wrestling.” the republican-controlled senate called no new witnesses, and only one senate republican, mitt romney, voted to convict trump on the charge of abuse of power. on february 5th, the day of trump’s acquittal, the u.s. had a dozen confirmed cases of covid-19. by june, the death toll in the u.s., the highest in the world, and the response to the pandemic had deepened doubts, at home and abroad, about the government’s competence. on june 3rd, mattis, who until then had been publicly silent about trump, criticized the administration’s heavy-handed response to the protests triggered by the murder of george floyd, in minneapolis, denouncing trump for dividing the nation and violating the constitutional rights of american citizens. for hill, the government’s handling of these crises provides the russians with yet another propaganda windfall. “if we can’t heal our own divisions, then we’re going to be exploited from here to eternity, and our allies will be turning away in horror,” she told me. “we’re an object of pity.”"
Oregon Department Of Justice To Sue Federal Agencies Over Protest Enforcement,39,htasdr,https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-police-portland-doj-lawsuit/,12,1595076021.0,,"update (saturday, 1:01 p.m. pt) —the oregon department of justice is suing several federal agencies for civil rights abuses, and state prosecutors will potentially pursue criminal charges against a federal officer who seriously injured a protester.

the federal lawsuit names the u.s. department of homeland security, the u.s. marshals service, the united states customs and border protection and the federal protective service, agencies that have had a role in stepped-up force used against protesters since early july. the state filed the lawsuit late friday night.

when asked for comment, the u.s. marshals service told opb it does not comment on pending litigation.

the lawsuit lists defendants specifically as john does 1-10 because the “identity of the officers is not known, nor is their agency affiliation,” the lawsuit states.

according to doj spokeswoman kristina edmunson, the suit accuses the agencies of engaging “in unlawful law enforcement in violation of the civil rights of oregon citizens by seizing and detaining them without probable cause.”

state attorneys are asking a judge to issue a temporary restraining order that ""would immediately stop federal authorities from unlawfully detaining oregonians,"" the doj said in a release.

the doj’s lawsuit is asking a judge to find that the federal agencies’ tactics are indeed unlawful and violate oregonians’ first, fourth and fifth amendment constitutional rights.

it is also asking that federal agents and officers identify themselves and their agencies before detaining or arresting any person, explain to the person why they’re being arrested or detained, and not arrest any person without probable cause or a warrant.

the agency said that its criminal justice division has also opened a criminal investigation, joined by multnomah county district attorney rod underhill, in the case of donavan la bella, a peaceful demonstrator who was shot in the head with an impact munition last saturday night, edmunson said.

those munitions are intended to be aimed below the waist.

la bella’s mom said she believes the officer aimed at la bella’s head.“he’s 6-foot-5,” said desiree la bella, referring to her son. “he has to be a terribly trained marksman to be off by 3 feet to hit him in the forehead right between the eyes. if he’s that bad of a shot at such a short distance he shouldn’t have a gun.”

related: federal law enforcement use unmarked vehicles to grab protesters off portland streets

the lawsuit, which is the second announced against federal authorities on friday, comes after reporting by opb that revealed federal agents have detained peaceful protesters using unmarked vehicles, with little explanation or indication of which agency they belong to or why people are being taken into custody.

“i share the concerns of our state and local leaders – and our oregon u.s. senators and certain congressional representatives – that the current escalation of fear and violence in downtown portland is being driven by federal law enforcement tactics that are entirely unnecessary and out of character with the oregon way. these tactics must stop,” oregon attorney general ellen rosenblum said in a statement.

the doj lawsuit specifically highlighted the case of mark pettibone, a demonstrator who was snatched off the street by federal officers in the early hours of july 16, put into a van, and brought to the federal courthouse.

“on information and belief, defendants did not have a warrant to seize pettibone or the other citizens who have been detained, and will continue to seize individuals off the street without a warrant, in the absence of an injunction,” the lawsuit reads.

due to both federal agents and their vehicles being unmarked, the lawsuit states that oregonians could be at risk of kidnapping by “militias and other civilian ‘volunteers’ taking it onto themselves to pull peaceful protesters into their cars, in a manner that resembles the federal actions described…”

pettibone echoed that concern in his declaration within the lawsuit.

“i did not know whether the men were police or far-right extremists, who, in my experience, frequently don military-like outfits and harass left-leaning protesters in portland,” pettibone said.

pettibone's arrest has spurred national attention as president trump has made portland a focal point in recent days, criticizing local elected leaders for being overly lenient on protesters. on thursday, acting homeland security secretary chad wolf flew into portland to tour the mark o. hatfield courthouse, the federal facility where graffiti and other vandalism has been frequent in seven weeks of protests over police violence and racial injustice.

since arriving just before july 4, the officers from customs and border protection’s elite bortac unit and the u.s. marshals special operations group have guarded portland’s federal courthouse. they’ve also assisted the portland police in clearing protesters from city streets.

city, state and congressional leaders have criticized the federal force's use of weapons against protesters and demanded their departure.

oregon u.s. democratic sen. jeff merkley saturday tweeted that he and sen. ron wyden, also an oregon democrat, plan to introduce an amendment to the u.s. congress' annual defense bill to ""stop the trump administration from sending its paramilitary squads onto america's streets.""

“the federal administration has chosen portland to use their scare tactics to stop our residents from protesting police brutality and from supporting the black lives matter movement,” rosenblum said in a statement. “every american should be repulsed when they see this happening. if this can happen here in portland, it can happen anywhere.”"
‘Inequality defines our time’: UN chief delivers hard-hitting Mandela day message,26,hti9ls,https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/07/1068611,13,1595114339.0,,"mr. guterres was delivering the 2020 nelson mandela annual lecture, held online for the first time, in light of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. the lecture series, held annually by the nelson mandela foundation, on the birthday of the first democratically-elected president of south africa, aims to encourage dialogue by inviting prominent personalities to discuss major international challenges.

the covid-19 spotlight

mr. guterres began by noting that the covid-19 pandemic has played an important role in highlighting growing inequalities, and exposing the myth that everyone is in the same boat, because “while we are all floating on the same sea, it’s clear that some are in superyachts, while others are clinging to the drifting debris.”

while we are all floating on the same sea, it’s clear that some are in superyachts while others are clinging to the drifting debris - antónio guterres, secretary-general, united nations

global risks ignored for decades – notably inadequate health systems, gaps in social protection, structural inequalities, environmental degradation, and the climate crisis – have been laid bare, he said. the vulnerable are suffering the most: those living in poverty, older people, and people with disabilities and pre-existing conditions.

mr. guterres pointed out that inequality take many forms. whilst income disparity is stark, with the 26 richest people in the world holding as much wealth as half the global population, it is also the case that life-chances depend on factors such as gender, family and ethnic background, race and whether or not a person has a disability.

however, he noted that everyone suffers the consequences, because high levels of inequality are associated with “economic instability, corruption, financial crises, increased crime and poor physical and mental health.”

the legacy of colonialism and patriarchy

un photo/evan schneider protests have been occurring daily in new york city against racism and police violence, following the death of george floyd.

colonialism, a historic aspect of inequality, was evoked by the secretary-general. today’s anti-racist movement, he said, points to this historic source of inequality: “the global north, specifically my own continent of europe, imposed colonial rule on much of the global south for centuries, through violence and coercion.”

this led to huge inequalities within and between countries, including the transatlantic slave trade and the apartheid regime in south africa, argued mr. guterres, and left a legacy of economic and social injustice, hate crimes and xenophobia, the persistence of institutionalized racism, and white supremacy.

mr. guterres also referred to patriarchy, another historic inequality which still resonates: women everywhere are worse off than men, and violence against women is, he said, at epidemic levels.

the un chief, who described himself as a proud feminist, said he was committed to gender equality, and has made gender parity a reality across senior un posts. he also announced his appointment of south african international rugby captain, siya kolisa, as a global champion for the spotlight initiative, which aims to engage men in fighting violence against women and girls.

‘everyone must pay their fair share’ of tax

turning to contemporary inequality, mr. guterres said that the expansion of trade, and technological progress, have contributed to “an unprecedented shift in income distribution”. low-skilled workers are bearing the brunt, he warned, and face an “onslaught” from new technologies, automation, the offshoring of manufacturing and the demise of labour organizations.

meanwhile, he continued, widespread tax concessions, tax avoidance and tax evasion, as well as low corporate tax rates, mean that there are reduced resources for social protection, education, and healthcare - services that play an important part in reducing inequality.

some countries have allowed the wealthy and well-connected to benefit from tax systems, but “everyone must pay their fair share”, said mr. guterres, and governments need to tackle the “vicious cycle” of corruption, which weakens social norms and the rule of law, and shift the tax burden from payrolls to carbon, which would help to address the climate crisis.

a new global deal

unicef/un0143514/karel prinsloo a student learns with the help of a computer tablet provided by unicef at a school in baigai, northern cameroon, tuesday 31 october 2017.

although climate change is a global problem, the effects are felt most keenly by those countries which are least to blame. the issue is likely to become more pronounced in the coming years, and millions risk malnutrition, malaria and other diseases; forced migration, and extreme weather events.

the only way towards a fair and sustainable future for all, he suggested, involves what he called a “new social contract”, which allows young people to live in dignity; women to have the same prospects and opportunities as men; and protects the vulnerable, and a “new global deal”, which ensures that power, wealth and opportunities are shared more broadly and fairly at the international level.

as part of the new social contract, labour market policies would be based on constructive dialogue between employers and workers, and would ensure human rights and fundamental freedoms.

the secretary-general called for new social safety nets, including universal health coverage, the possibility of universal basic income, boosted investment in public services, and, to reverse long-standing inequalities, affirmative action programmes and other policies to address inequalities in gender, race or ethnicity.

the un chief explained that quality education for all, and the effective use of digital technology, will be crucial to achieving these aims.

this would mean doubling education spending in low and middle-income countries by 2030 to $3 trillion a year: within a generation, all children in low- and middle-income countries could have access to quality education at all levels.

governments also need to transform the way children are taught, said mr. guterres, and invest in digital literacy and infrastructure, and help them to prepare for a rapidly changing workplace that is being upended by technology.

the secretary-general outlined some of the ways that the un is supporting these efforts, including the roadmap for digital cooperation, launched at the united nations in june, which promotes ways to connect four billion people to the internet by 2030, and “giga”, an ambitious project to get every school in the world online.

‘we stand together, or we fall apart’

the un chief ended his major strategic vision statement, by invoking the importance of international cooperation and solidarity.

“we belong to each other”, he said. “we stand together, or we fall apart”.

the world, he concluded, is at breaking point, and it is time for leaders to decide which path to follow. the choice presented by mr. guterres, is between “chaos, division and inequality”, or righting the wrongs of the past and moving forward together, for the good of all."

Inside Trump’s Failure: The Rush to Abandon Leadership Role on the Virus,26,htrt98,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html,5,1595149174.0,,"follow our live coverage of the 2020 election between joe biden and president trump.

washington — each morning at 8 as the coronavirus crisis was raging in april, mark meadows, the white house chief of staff, convened a small group of aides to steer the administration through what had become a public health, economic and political disaster.

seated around mr. meadows’s conference table and on a couch in his office down the hall from the oval office, they saw their immediate role as practical problem solvers. produce more ventilators. find more personal protective equipment. provide more testing.

but their ultimate goal was to shift responsibility for leading the fight against the pandemic from the white house to the states. they referred to this as “state authority handoff,” and it was at the heart of what would become at once a catastrophic policy blunder and an attempt to escape blame for a crisis that had engulfed the country — perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations.

over a critical period beginning in mid-april, president trump and his team convinced themselves that the outbreak was fading, that they had given state governments all the resources they needed to contain its remaining “embers” and that it was time to ease up on the lockdown."

environment and water minister tuan ibrahim tuan man said 1,864 tonnes of electric arc furnace dust (eafd) - a by-product of steel production that contains heavy metals like zinc, cadmium and lead - were found abandoned at the tanjung pelepas port in the southern state of johor, according to bernama.

“the discovery of the eafd, on transit in malaysia and bound for indonesia, is the biggest finding of its kind in malaysian history,” tuan ibrahim was quoted as saying.

he said the eafd, classified as a toxic waste under the basel convention, had been listed as concentrated zinc in declaration forms.

“the department of environment, as the basel convention authority (for malaysia), has not granted approval for or received notifications from the waste exporter to transit in malaysia,” he said.

malaysia has contacted the romanian basel convention authority to arrange for the repatriation of the containers and have engaged interpol for further investigations, bernama said.

the romanian embassy in kuala lumpur did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Trump not ready to commit to election results if he loses,307,hu2rko,https://apnews.com/aa07c0a980b3353b15f94442eb8191a5,98,1595203103.0,,"president donald trump pauses as he speaks during an event on regulatory reform on the south lawn of the white house, thursday, july 16, 2020, in washington.

washington (ap) — president donald trump is refusing to publicly commit to accepting the results of the upcoming white house election, recalling a similar threat he made weeks before the 2016 vote, as he scoffs at polls showing him lagging behind democrat joe biden. trump says it’s too early to make such an ironclad guarantee.

“i have to see. look ... i have to see,” trump told moderator chris wallace during a wide-ranging interview on ”fox news sunday.” “no, i’m not going to just say yes. i’m not going to say no, and i didn’t last time either.” the biden campaign responded: “the american people will decide this election. and the united states government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the white house.”

trump also hammered the pentagon brass for favoring renaming bases that honor confederate military leaders — a drive for change spurred by the national debate about race after george floyd’s death. “i don’t care what the military says,” the commander in chief said.

the president described the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, dr. anthony fauci, as a “a little bit of an alarmist” about the coronavirus pandemic, and trump stuck to what he had said back in february — that the virus is “going to disappear.” on fox, he said, “i’ll be right eventually.” the united states tops the global death toll list with over 140,000 and confirmed infections, with 3.7 million.

it is remarkable that a sitting president would express less than complete confidence in the american democracy’s electoral process. but for trump, it comes from his insurgent playbook of four years ago, when in the closing stages of his race against hillary clinton, he said he would not commit to honoring the election results if the democrat won.

pressed during an october 2016 debate about whether he would abide by the voters’ will, trump responded that he would “keep you in suspense.” the president’s remarks to fox are certain to fuel conversation on capitol hill, where lawmakers had already been airing concerns in private about a scenario in which trump disputes the election results.

trump has seen his presidential popularity erode over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and in the aftermath of nationwide protests centered on racial injustice that erupted after floyd’s death in minneapolis nearly two months.

trump contends that a series of polls that show his popularity eroding and biden holding an advantage are faulty. he believes republican voters are underrepresented in such surveys.

“first of all, i’m not losing, because those are fake polls,” trump said in the taped interview, which aired sunday. “they were fake in 2016 and now they’re even more fake. the polls were much worse in 2016.”

full coverage: election 2020

trump was frequently combative with wallace in defending his administration’s response to the pandemic, weighing in on the black lives matter movement and trying to portray biden, the presumptive democratic nominee, as lacking the mental prowess to serve as president.

among the issues discussed was the push for wholesale changes in policing that has swept across the nation. trump said he could understand why black americans are upset about how police use force disproportionately against them.

“of course i do. of course i do,” the president said, adding his usual refrain that “whites are also killed, too.”

he said he was “not offended either by black lives matter,” but at the same time defended the confederate flag, a symbol of the racism of the past, and said those who “proudly have their confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism.”

“they love their flag, it represents the south, they like the south. that’s freedom of speech. and you know, the whole thing with ‘cancel culture,’ we can’t cancel our whole history. we can’t forget that the north and the south fought. we have to remember that, otherwise we’ll end up fighting again. you can’t just cancel all,” trump said.

wallace challenged trump on some of his claims and called out the president at time, such as when trump falsely asserted that “biden wants to defund the police.” the former vice president has not joined with activists rallying behind that banner. he has proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.

trump continues to insist that biden “signed a charter” with one of his primary rivals on the left, sen. bernie sanders of vermont. at one point in the interview, trump calls on aides to bring him documentation to support his assertion. trump, however, is unable to point to language from a biden-sanders task force policy document released this month by the biden campaign.

trump stood behind his pledge to veto a $740 billion defense bill over a requirement that the defense department change the names of bases named for confederate military leaders. that list includes fort bragg in north carolina, fort hood in texas and fort benning in georgia.

the president argued there were no viable alternatives if the government ever tried. “we’re going to name it after the reverend al sharpton?” trump asked, referring to a prominent civil rights leader. “what are you going to name it?”

trump, 74, stuck to a campaign charge that biden, 77, is unable to handle the rigors of the white house because of his age. as for polls showing the incumbent is trailing, trump noted he was thought to be behind for much of the 2016 contest. “i won’t lose,” he predicted.

the president and top advisors have long accused biden of using the pandemic as an excuse to stay in “his basement” in his delaware home. biden has indeed shifted much of his campaign online, but frequently travels in delaware and pennsylvania, organizing speeches and small gatherings with voters and community leaders that are within driving distance of his home. biden’s campaign says it will begin resuming normal travel and campaign activities, but only when health officials and state and local authorities say it is safe.

questioned about the coronavirus, trump chided fauci, the national institutes of health expert, and repeated false claims that anybody could get a test and that increased testing was the only reason that the u.s. was seeing more cases. when wallace cited criticism about the lack of a national plan to confront the virus, trump said, “i take responsibility always for everything because it’s ultimately my job, too,” and claimed, “i supplied everybody.”

case are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down. the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus has been on the rise across nearly the entire country.

columbia, s.c. (ap) — rapper kanye west, in his first event since declaring himself a presidential candidate, ranted against historical figure harriet tubman on sunday, saying the underground railroad conductor “never actually freed the slaves, she just had them work for other white people,” comments that drew shouts of opposition from some in the crowd.

west delivered a lengthy monologue, touching on topics from abortion and religion to international trade and licensing deals, before a crowd in north charleston, south carolina. whether he is actually seeking the nation’s highest office remains a question.

tubman is one of the most respected figures of 19th century america. an african american who escaped slavery, she helped enslaved black men and women travel north to freedom and fought for the union during the civil war. she later became a supporter of women’s suffrage.

on abortion, west said that while he believes it should be legal, financial incentives to help struggling mothers could be a way to discourage the practice.

“everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars,” he said as an example.

wearing a protective vest and with “2020” shaved into his head, the entertainer appeared on a livestream of the event. several hundred people gathered in a venue, where gospel music played before west’s appearance.

the event was reportedly for registered guests only, although a campaign website had no registration or rsvp information.

speaking without a microphone, west became tearful at one point while talking about his mother, who died following plastic surgery complications in 2007.

west missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states, and it was unclear if he was willing or able to collect enough signatures required to qualify in others. last week, he qualified to appear on oklahoma’s presidential ballot, the first state where he met the requirements before the filing deadline.

west needed to collect 10,000 signatures by noon monday to appear on the south carolina ballot, according to state law. the entertainer tweeted out a list of locations around the charleston area where petitions could be signed. email to an address purportedly associated with the campaign was not returned sunday afternoon.

west, who is married to reality television star kim kardashian west, initially announced his candidacy on july 4.

China expands its amphibious forces in challenge to U.S. supremacy beyond Asia,31,hul38u,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-military-amphibious/?_ga=2.150611446.158355996.1595250985-999147806.1591893331,2,1595279927.0,,"“without an amphibious force, any military force is greatly constrained in where and how it can conduct operations,” said grant newsham, a retired u.s. marine corps colonel and researcher at the japan forum for strategic studies. newsham advised the japanese military on the formation of tokyo’s own amphibious rapid deployment brigade, formed in 2018. “jets can drop bombs and ships can fire missiles at the shore - but you might need infantry to go ashore and kill the enemy and occupy the ground.”

china’s ministry of national defense and the pentagon did not respond to questions from reuters.

at home, too, the pla marines have become an important tool in the ruling communist party’s efforts to showcase china’s increasingly powerful military to its domestic audience. the state-controlled media regularly reports on the gruelling training and military skills of the jiaolong, or sea dragon commandos - a unit from the marines special forces brigade based on hainan island off southern china.

“we should be the point of the sword in joint operations to strike terror into the heart of the enemy,” said gong kaifeng, a jiaolong commandos company commander, in a report last year on the unit's training broadcast on state television.

when the type 075 ships enter service, china will have the capacity to combine them with its other new amphibious and support vessels, chinese and foreign analysts say. these self-contained fleets can be sent to distant conflicts, deployed as a show of force to deter potential enemies or to protect chinese investments and citizens abroad. they would also allow the pla to provide disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, competing with the u.s. for prestige and soft power.

invading taiwan

for beijing, these amphibious forces will also contribute to the pla’s mounting capacity to make a landing on taiwan or seize other strategically important or disputed territory in china’s offshore regions, according to specialists in amphibious warfare.

beijing regards self-governing taiwan a province of china. xi jinping has said unifying taiwan with the mainland is a vital step in realizing the chinese people’s dream of a powerful, rejuvenated nation. in a key speech early last year calling on taiwan to open talks on peaceful reunification, xi warned that this long-standing dispute could not be deferred indefinitely. “we make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,” xi said.

china has this year stepped up military operations and exercises around taiwan, according to u.s. and taiwanese military analysts. pla air force jets, including at least one bomber and a fighter, briefly entered taiwan’s air defense identification zone on june 22, before being warned off by the taiwanese air force, the island’s military said. it was the eighth such encounter in two weeks, the military said.

taiwan launched its annual han kuang defense exercise on july 13 with an emphasis on joint operations between land, sea and air forces to defend the island from attack, according to the island's military. the exercise also involved an expanded role for reservists as the military strives to boost its firepower, senior taiwan government officials said.

“our military is always working hard to prepare for war, closely monitoring the dynamics of the chinese communist’s military and the development of the situation in the taiwan strait,” taiwan’s defense ministry said in response to questions from reuters. “we have a complete defense plan and appropriate actions to deal with the threat of the chinese communists attacking taiwan and the seizure of offshore islands, which can ensure national security.”

experts on amphibious forces note the pla already has powerful army units that are trained and equipped to make the kind of landings necessary for an invasion of taiwan. in expanding the marines, they argue, pla military planners are looking at operations across the globe, in places where china has extensive offshore investments. these commercial interests are likely to multiply as beijing presses ahead with its belt and road initiative, an ambitious bid to put china at the center of global trading routes.

china’s marines will also be important to man what is expected to become a network of strategic military bases around the world, including fortifications on territory beijing has seized in the south china sea, according to chinese and western military commentators.

beijing has already deployed marines and their armored vehicles to its first overseas base at djibouti on the horn of africa, according to pentagon reports. marines are also deployed on the flotillas china sends on naval anti-piracy missions to the gulf of aden, these reports said.

“we are currently only seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said ian easton, the senior director of the project 2049 institute, an arlington, virginia-based security research group. “ten years from now, china is almost certainly going to have marine units deployed at locations all over the world. the chinese communist party’s ambitions are global. its interests are global. it plans to send military units wherever its global strategic interests require.”

short of war, capable amphibious forces will also become a powerful diplomatic or coercive tool for beijing, military analysts say. so far, washington has had a monopoly on this type of engagement with other governments, routinely sending marine expeditionary units abroad for port visits, joint training exercises and disaster relief.

u.s. expeditionary flotillas, packed with marines, all their heavy equipment and air support, are a potent reminder of american power. a raw demonstration came in the tense period in 1999 when an australian-led united nations peacekeeping force intervened to stop violence in what was then indonesian-controlled east timor. american forces didn’t become heavily involved on the ground. but the presence of the uss belleau wood, a 40,000-tonne amphibious assault ship carrying 900 marines and heavy lift and attack helicopters, served as formidable back-up as the un troops restored order without any significant resistance from indonesia.

seizing islands

china’s first two type 075 amphibious assault vessels are now berthed together undergoing final fit-out at a state-owned shanghai shipyard, china’s official military media has reported. photographs in the official media and commercial satellite images show that the 250-meter-long vessels appear similar to flat-top amphibious assault ships in service with other advanced navies, including the u.s. fleet. america currently has a fleet of eight wasp and two america-class amphibious assault vessels.

however, in a blow to u.s. efforts to blunt the challenge from china, the wasp-class amphibious assault ship uss bonhomme richard caught fire on july 12 while tied up at its home port in san diego. the ship was extensively damaged in the fire which burned for four days. it was unclear if the ship would be salvaged, the u.s. navy said.

since 2005, china has also built a fleet of six type 071 amphibious ships, according to a 2019 report from the u.s. defense intelligence agency. these vessels can carry up to four air-cushion landing craft, similar to the hovercraft carried on u.s. amphibious landing ships, as well as four or more helicopters, armored vehicles and troops on long-distance deployments, the report said. a seventh type 071 is under construction, according to western military analysts.





this reuters annotation of a maxar technologies satellite image from april 1, 2020, shows three of china’s amphibious assault vessels at a shanghai shipyard.





china’s official shipbuilding industry journals have reported the 29,000-tonne type 071 has command and control capabilities, a medical unit and accommodation for hundreds of marines. the 210-meter long vessel has a range of 10,000 nautical miles and reached a speed of 25 knots in trials, these reports said.

to build the force that will embark on these ships, china began a rapid increase in the size of its marine force in 2017, according to pentagon reports. earlier, marines had been a low priority in the decades when china’s military built a massive ground force to defend the mainland. a regiment of marines was formed in 1953 and expanded to a division but then disbanded in 1957, according to an official timeline of major events in pla history. it was reformed in 1979, the timeline shows.

the u.s. defense intelligence agency report said china’s marine force is now organized into seven brigades, each with armor, infantry, artillery and missiles, and is the strongest force of this type among the rival claimants to disputed territories in the south china sea. china’s marines “can simultaneously seize multiple islands in the spratlys,” the report said, referring to a contested group of islands and reefs in the south china sea. they could also rapidly reinforce china’s outposts in the paracel islands, another disputed territory in the same waterway. china does not publish detailed accounts of the disposition of its forces.

“the chinese communist party’s ambitions are global. its interests are global. it plans to send military units wherever its global strategic interests require.”

amphibious warfare specialists say these marines would also be useful for seizing other disputed territory, including the uninhabited group of isles in the east china sea that are claimed by both tokyo and beijing - known as the senkaku islands in japan and the diaoyu islands in china.

selected army units are being transferred to the marines to boost the force’s capability, according to reports in the official chinese military media and western defense analysts. china’s official military newspaper, the pla daily, reported in april that two army units trained in aerial assault had been transferred to a marines brigade dedicated to helicopter landings.

the pentagon’s annual report on chinese military power in 2018 revealed that a newly established headquarters under the command of the navy was responsible for staffing, training and equipping the expanding force. and, the report said, a new commander had been appointed to lead the marines. china’s state-controlled media has identified him as major general kong jun, a former army officer who transferred to the marines in early 2017.

despite this build-up, the pentagon and other western military experts argue the pla marines remain far less capable than the 186,000-strong u.s. marine corps, with its extensive experience of amphibious and land operations.

in its 2019 report on china’s military power, the pentagon said most of the new pla marines brigades were not yet manned and equipped to be fully operational. it said china’s marines lacked sufficient armored vehicles, helicopters and training to conduct complex amphibious operations.

some western military experts suggest one reason for this: the top priorities for the pla brass are the army amphibious units and air force airborne troops that would spearhead an attack on taiwan. so, the marines “don’t have priority when it comes to things like amphibious tanks and helicopters,” said easton of the project 2049 institute, who has written a book, the chinese invasion threat, on the pla’s preparations to conquer taiwan.

the ruling communist party has long wanted control of taiwan for political reasons. the island also has huge strategic importance. it would give the pla a key foothold in the so-called first island chain, the string of islands that run from the japanese archipelago through taiwan, the philippines and on to borneo, enclosing china’s coastal seas. from bases on taiwan, chinese warships, strike aircraft and missiles would dominate the sea lanes vital to japan and south korea. and taiwan would be an ideal jump-off point for operations aimed at seizing further territory in the island chain.

newsham, the retired u.s. marine colonel, said the pla had assembled a formidable army amphibious force and sufficient ships, military and civilian, to probably land enough troops on taiwan as part of a full-scale attack that includes air, missile, naval and cyber assaults. “the pla already has a lot lined up,” he said.

new york (ap) — presidential politics move fast. what we’re watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign:

days to general election: 106

days to first state offering early voting (pennsylvania): 56

___

the narrative

president donald trump insists he’s not losing, but by virtually every objective measure he’s struggling through one of the worst moments of his presidency. trump demoted his campaign manager last week, acknowledging through his actions, if not his words, that things are not moving in the right direction.

republican allies have begun to share concern publicly about trump’s political strategy and his inconsistent leadership, most notably his handling of the coronavirus pandemic . daily infections are exploding , the death rate is ticking up and the economic recovery is in jeopardy .

trump on sunday charged, without evidence, that democratic state and local officials were planning to close schools and roll back reopening plans just to hurt him. multiple polls suggest that a majority of voters, including many republicans, simply don’t believe what trump says about the pandemic.

meanwhile, trump also refused to say whether he would accept the results of the general election . early voting begins across multiple swing states in just eight weeks.

___

the big questions

does trump have a strategy to win?

scott walker, the former wisconsin governor and a trump ally, tells us that he sees no clear strategy coming from the trump campaign. some might think that’s why trump downgraded campaign manager brad parscale last week, except that his replacement, bill stepien, had largely been running the political operation already.

there is little evidence that trump is working to expand his coalition. he seems to be betting everything that he can win by energizing his base while depressing turnout among would-be biden supporters by redefining the lifelong politician with a flood of negative advertising. trump’s campaign has reserved $146 million in television ads this fall, the vast majority of which is going to must-win states like florida and ohio he carried four years ago.

advertisement

trump’s team continues to embrace a kitchen sink messaging campaign against biden that features questions about his mental competence, his allegiance to the far left, his inconsistent record and conspiracy theories about the integrity of the election itself. the scattershot approach is frustrating allies like walker, although it’s not likely to change anytime soon.

are school closures already america’s next major crisis?

full coverage: election 2020

several weeks before many elementary and secondary schools are scheduled to open, there are clear signs that surging coronavirus infections will force education officials in several states to keep their doors closed . that leaves millions of children and their parents in limbo and threatens the economic recovery.

trump told fox news channel on sunday that democrats were planning to close schools just to hurt him but cited no evidence for his claim. he also threatened to strip federal funding from public schools if they refuse to open. such rhetoric won’t help ensure that it’s safe for children and their teachers to get back to the classroom.

is biden’s veep search actually expanding?

the biggest decision of biden’s campaign looms as he continues his search for a running mate . as few as six serious contenders advanced in the search earlier this summer. but amid pressure for biden to make a selection that would satisfy a wide range of priorities and constituencies, additional candidates have joined the vetting process in recent weeks, according to multiple democrats with knowledge of the dynamics. that’s yielding an unusually large field of contenders, including some of the nation’s best-known politicians and others who have a lower profile.

those known to be under consideration earlier include sens. kamala harris of california and elizabeth warren of massachusetts, florida rep. val demings, michigan gov. gretchen whitmer, atlanta mayor keisha lance-bottoms and susan rice, who served as president barack obama’s national security adviser. former georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams, illinois sen. tammy duckworth and california rep. karen bass have come under greater consideration more recently.

are we headed toward a constitutional crisis?

trump on sunday refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election if he lost. “i have to see,” he told “fox news sunday” host chris wallace. “no, i’m not going to just say ‘yes.’ i’m not going to say ‘no.’”

trump made a similar statement that frightened constitutional scholars four years ago, although it was quickly forgotten after trump’s victory . with his numbers looking worse heading into 2020, some are taking the threat more seriously this time. of course, the president has also spent several weeks working to undermine the integrity of the election by raising unfounded questions about mail voting . combine that rhetoric with an array of ballot issues expected as the coronavirus forces changes into the election system this fall, and it’s not hard to imagine a legitimate constitutional crisis in november.

___

the final thought

we’ve seen over and over that it doesn’t matter much who trump taps to serve as his campaign manager or chief of staff. one man and one man only is making the big decisions that will decide the president’s political future and the immediate future of the united states.

trump told us he was his own best strategist four years ago, yet many still believed he would put experienced and effective leaders around him to guide his decisions. four years later, it’s become clear that history will remember the 45th president as a man whose fate was decided almost exclusively by his own instincts.

Corporate giants shut down Trump texting,27,huqzl7,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/20/trump-massive-texting-program-suspended-372302,31,1595299409.0,,"it took five days to resolve the shutdown, leading republicans to worry the same thing could happen this fall as the president urges his supporters to vote, when the stakes will be much higher.

people familiar with the chain of events said verizon, t-mobile and at&t flagged potential regulatory problems with the peer-to-peer messaging operation, which differs from robo-texting in that texts are sent individually, as opposed to a mass blast. but within trump’s orbit, the episode has further fueled suspicions that big tech companies are looking to influence the election. in recent weeks, the president has accused twitter and facebook of censoring conservative voices and son donald trump jr. has alleged that gmail is sending reelection campaign emails to spam folders.

“they’re all working to get out the vote, so to see telecom come down and prevent any campaign or organization from getting out the vote is troubling."" tim cameron, a digital strategist who has worked for the nrsc

“a campaign’s email and text messaging list are some of the most important assets they have in 2020,” said eric wilson, a republican digital strategist who worked on marco rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign, adding that it was “really very concerning to see that such a significant issue happened and to see that it wasn’t resolved in a timely manner.”

representatives for the telecom companies declined to comment for the record. but people close to verizon, t-mobile and at&t said the decision was not made by them, but rather by third-party administrators they employ to monitor text messaging and protect consumers from spamming. they strenuously denied that there was any partisan intent and say they were merely following guidelines conveyed by the cellular telecommunications industry association, a trade group that represents mobile phone outfits.

the organization declined to specify what the trump campaign had done wrong, but said in a statement, “we expect all senders — whether airlines, schools, banks or campaigns — to include clear opt-out language and gain prior consent before sending a text.”

“these simple steps help protect consumers from spam and maintain text messaging as a trusted medium for everyone,” it added.

democrats also use text messaging in their campaigns, but the digitally focused trump reelection effort is particularly emphasizing it. it has spent the past few years harvesting cellphone numbers, including from attendees to the president’s trademark rallies. the onset of the coronavirus pandemic has ensured that voter outreach will be more digital — and text message-centered — than usual.

this month's operation was intended as a dry run to determine whether the texting program would run into problems — and to avoid reprising mitt romney’s election day experience in 2012, when his lightly tested voter turnout program crashed as people headed to the polls. come fall, the trump political apparatus is looking to send tens of millions of messages to supporters prodding them to vote.

the problem was eventually ironed out after a series of conversations with the wireless companies and their third-party administrators. but the damage was already done.

the independence day message was get-out-the-vote-themed, but the resulting shutdown of the campaign's texting infrastructure also hampered donor outreach. while republican officials declined to estimate exactly how much they had lost in prospective donations, they acknowledged it was likely substantial. trump used the long holiday weekend to accuse liberals of conspiring to tear down monuments — the kind of red-meat messaging that typically fires up his small-donor base.

republicans are calling it the latest in a string of decisions by tech titans that are hurting trump.

tim cameron, a digital strategist who has worked for the national republican senatorial committee and ex-house speaker newt gingrich, called the shutdown “odd,” especially while companies like facebook and lyft launch programs encouraging people to cast ballots this fall.

“they’re all working to get out the vote, so to see telecom come down and prevent any campaign or organization from getting out the vote is troubling,” cameron added.

the trump campaign has previously faced pushback over its text messaging tactics. three minnesotans have filed a lawsuit alleging the reelection effort sent text messages without receiving consent. a federal judge last month denied the campaign’s motion to dismiss the case.

the legal wrangling centers on a 1991 federal law which aims to shield consumers from a deluge of unwanted robocalls and texts. but changing technology has created ambiguities around the statute’s requirements, and businesses with an interest in reaching out to people via text have called on the federal communications commission to provide greater clarity.

more recently, the fcc has ruled that peer-to-peer texting does not require consent, as long as texts are sent individually and not by auto-dial or robo-dial.

democrats, too, have run into problems. last month, two minnesota residents brought a class action lawsuit against bernie sanders’ presidential campaign over what they said were routine spam texts to which they had never consented.

“peer-to-peer texting has quickly become a critical tool for republicans and democrats. both sides agree, it's going to lead to more americans voting, a great thing for our country,” said gary coby, the trump campaign’s digital director. “there is bipartisan commitment to continue working with mobile carriers and the entire mobile messaging industry to ensure the channel remains open and secure.”

it’s not the first sign of tension between trump and the country’s telecom heavyweights.

after failing to block at&t from buying cnn-owned time warner last year, trump called for a boycott on the wireless giant, writing on twitter that if ""people [stopped] using or subscribing to @att, they would be forced to make big changes at @cnn.”

the president this spring cheered the retirement of longtime at&t executive randall stephenson, tweeting that, “anyone who lets a garbage ‘network’ do and say the things that cnn does, should leave asap. hopefully replacement will be much better!""

trump has yet to weigh in on the text message shutdown. but republicans acknowledge it has left them rattled.

“i understand that telecom might want to change the rules about how political campaigns operate on their platforms,” cameron said, a charge the telecom industry strenuously denies. “but those changes should take place after the election, and once they’re in place when you’re in a period just a few months before the election, it’s not the time to change them.”"
Trump administration preparing to send federal agents to Chicago,330,huw0tt,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/20/politics/trump-administration-federal-agents-chicago/index.html,117,1595315332.0,,"(cnn) the trump administration is preparing to send federal agents to chicago this week, two law enforcement officials tell cnn, as president donald trump and top officials are promising to crack down on what they say are violence and the increase in crime in major cities.

one senior law enforcement official told cnn that there are plans to send federal agents to chicago through the end of the summer. the agents will focus on illegal gun sales and gun violence and outstanding warrants, among other targets, according to one of the sources. both sources said an announcement could be made in the coming days.

the department of homeland security plans to send more than 150 homeland security investigations agents to chicago for a 60-day stint, according to a source familiar with the deployment. homeland security investigations is a branch of immigration and customs enforcement that serves as the investigative arm of dhs and specializes in countering cross-border criminal activity.

the effort appears to be separate from the federal presence in portland , oregon, which was part of the president's demand that federal buildings be protected from protesters.

chicago's mayor warned monday about such plans in the wake of criticisms of how federal agents are facing off with protesters in portland.

HUD: Homeless shelters can use physical characteristics to ID transgender people,10,huw3oh,https://www.businessinsider.com/homeless-shelters-can-use-physical-features-spot-transgender-women-hud-2020-7?r=US&IR=T,5,1595315614.0,,"a proposal from the department of housing and urban development would allow federally funded homeless shelters to take a person's ""physical characteristics"" into account when deciding if they should be housed among men or women.

hud is working to reverse the obama-era equal access rule that provides housing to transgender people based on the gender identity with which they identify.

the rule's text, first reported by vox, says shelter staff can look for ""factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an adam's apple.""

if a person's ""biological sex"" is not apparent based on observation, staff at women's-only shelters are allowed to ask for proof.

visit business insider's homepage for more stories.

a proposed rule from the department of housing and urban development (hud) tells homeless shelters to use people's physical attributes — rather than their self-identified gender — to decide whether the homeless should be housed among men or women.

vox obtained a copy of the rule's text, which is part of hud's effort to roll back the obama-era equal access rule that ensures transgender people are served based on their gender identities.

now, the rule allows workers at federally funded homeless shelters to rely on ""factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an adam's apple, and other physical characteristics which, when considered together, are indicative of a person's biological sex.""

staff members at women's shelters may determine whether to admit someone based on visual appearance, according to vox. if the woman's gender is unclear based on her appearance, shelter workers are permitted to seek proof of her sex before granting her housing. people who are turned away may be forced to go to a men's shelter, according to vox.

""evidence requested must not be unduly intrusive of privacy, such as private physical anatomical evidence. evidence requested could include government identification, but lack of government identification alone cannot be the sole basis for denying admittance on the basis of sex,"" the rule continues, per vox.

transgender people already face enormous barriers when trying to find a home. the national center for transgender equality found that one in five trans people have faced discrimination when seeking housing, more than one in 10 have faced evictions, and one in three have been homeless.

""discrimination and criminalization have left countless transgender people, particularly transgender people of color, exposed to violence and abuse, all while family rejection can leave transgender youth with nowhere to turn,"" mara keisling, the center's executive director, said in a statement.

hud secretary dr. ben carson is a former neurosurgeon who has been hostile to transgender people during his 2016 presidential bid. in 2019, he claimed at an event that the agency ""no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women,"" while describing trans women as ""big, hairy men"" who would try to ""infiltrate"" women's homeless shelters, staffers told the washington post.

""secretary carson is contradicting the very mission of his department by trying to make shelters less safe for those who need them and further endangering the lives of marginalized people,"" keisling said."
What You Need To Know About The Battle of Portland,19,hv149r,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/07/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-battle-of-portland/,18,1595335724.0,,"what you need to know about the battle of portland

the city of portland, oregon is currently in the national spotlight after video evidence of federal agents driving rented vans and abducting activists went viral. this footage was taken in the early morning hours of july 15, and an oregon public broadcasting article published on the 16th brought the matter out of the local social networks of portland activists and on to the national stage.

as i write this, mainstream media personalities are beginning to parachute into portland to cover what some have dubbed the “fascist takeover of portland”. the word “gestapo” is trending on twitter.

the abduction filmed on the 15th did not happen in a vacuum. as other local reporters have noted, it was the end result of more than six weeks of escalating state violence against largely nonviolent demonstrators. i have been in the streets of portland documenting this movement since the very first riot. before the national press unleashes a flood of new stories based on their first few hours in town, i’d like to explain what’s been happening:

state and federal law enforcement are at war with the people of portland.

the beginning

depending on who you ask, portland’s fifty-plus nights of protests either started on may 27th, when a group organized by several indigenous activists and other activists of color occupied the steps of the justice center, or on may 29th, portland’s first night of large scale protests in the wake of george floyd’s death. the evening began with a large, peaceful rally at north portland’s peninsula park. several thousand citizens gathered there, and marched 4.1 miles to merge with the protesters occupying the steps of the justice center.

the multnomah county justice center contains the portland police bureau’s chief headquarters, as well as the city jail. the youth liberation front, who describe themselves as “several packs of feral teens,” had occupied the steps of the justice center for a little less than three days at this point. they were all raided by the police on the night of the 28th, but for the most part police presence was minimal in the days leading up to the 29th.

while several thousand citizens marched from peninsula park, a crowd of hundreds gathered at the justice center. there were no police in sight. at one point a black man on a trike rolled up and started playing “it’s been a long, long time coming” by sam cooke. a dance party ensued:

pretty high fucking mood here in portland right now pic.twitter.com/kswtygzmmb — robert evans (the only robert evans) (@iwriteok) may 30, 2020

at 10:35 p.m. local time, the crowd at the justice center marched off into the streets of downtown portland and, several minutes later, met up with the crowd from peninsula park. together, both groups marched back to the justice center and surrounded it.

at a little before 11 p.m., several dozen protesters began to shatter the windows of the justice center. they entered the building, trashing the interior and lighting random fires inside. i watched all this happen from feet away, and it is my opinion that the destruction was unplanned, yet more or less inevitable — you could feel it in the mood of the crowd. the 3rd precinct in minneapolis had just burned: there was absolutely no way portland wasn’t going to try to do the same thing.

of course, the portland police bureau (ppb) arrived very shortly thereafter. in one of the more gentlemanly moments of the entire uprising, they gave a warning to people who’d brought their families and dogs, urging them to leave. a sizable chunk of more moderate demonstrators went home. a thousand or more protesters ranked up, and began shouting at the police. at a little after midnight, the ppb launched the first of what would eventually be hundreds of tear gas grenades into the crowd.

the crowd scattered, pushed by police in several different directions at once. they split into several groups. one rampaged through a series of downtown banks, shattering windows and lighting fires as they ran from the cops. another, larger group of demonstrators tore through the luxury shopping district, sacking the apple store, louis vuitton, h&m and, eventually, looting a target. the rest of the night was a messy haze of gas, flash-bangs, and burning barricades.

the portland police have stated that more than a dozen riots took place over the last fifty days, but may 29th remains the only night that truly felt like the actual people of this city were rioting.

a very bad weekend

portland mayor ted wheeler was out of town on what has become known as riot night. at 11:49 p.m., less than an hour into the rioting, he posted this angry tweet:

enough. i had to leave portland today because my mother is dying. i am with family to prepare for her final moments. this is hard, this is personal, but so is watching my city get destroyed. i’m coming back now. you will be hearing from me, @portlandpolice, community leaders. — mayor ted wheeler (@tedwheeler) may 30, 2020

wheeler declared a state of emergency early the next morning and instituted an 8 p.m. curfew for the entire city. well over a thousand protesters assembled the next day, saturday, in front of the justice center. starting at around 6:00 p.m., they occupied the intersection of 3rd and main, which sits between the justice center and the federal courthouse. police mostly held back behind the justice center until a little after 6:50, when a group of four activists sat down in the middle of the intersection of 2nd and main.

police quickly shoved the demonstrators out of the intersection and then occupied it themselves, ensuring it was still just as closed to traffic as it had been when the protesters occupied it. groups of protesters began to move in to confront the police and laid down in front of their riot line:

this situation very quickly turned violent. police began by pulling people up from the ground and then pushing forward into the crowd behind them, shoving with their nightsticks until, at about 6:58 p.m., one hour before curfew, police started hitting people. the crowd retreated at first, but eventually formed up and halted, waving protest signs in the officers’ faces. police swung several times at crowd members, driving them back, and eventually charged into the crowd with abandon, even striking at people who were on the ground. at one point an officer lost his baton and charged into the crowd, pummeling a demonstrator with his gloved fists.

following this, the portland police ordered the crowd to step back from the road and into the parks. they then began launching tear gas, coating the parks and also dousing dozens of random motorists who had the misfortune to be anywhere within several blocks of downtown.

again, the demonstrations continued for hours. the crowd was eventually chased down to the waterfront and broken apart by a curtain of tear-gas. thousands of portlanders watched the day’s violence on livestreams by various journalists and came out the next day, sunday the 31st of may, to register their displeasure. an enormous demonstration, between 7-10,000 people, rallied at laurelhurst park.

by the time the crowd started marching they were all in violation of the curfew. but there were far, far too many people to arrest, and the police kept their distance almost the entire march. they seemed to panic at one point, when the crowd began marching across the burnside bridge into downtown, towards the justice center. several riot trucks, loaded down with officers, came roaring in to block the bridge. when they got a good look at the sheer size of the crowd, they turned back around.

the crowd eventually reached and surrounded the justice center. a tense, hours-long stand-off ensued. activists demanded the police take off their riot gear, then amended that to asking them to take a knee. the police were unmoved. eventually, the crowd thinned out enough that the ppb felt secure dispersing it. the evening ended with small groups of protesters running through the streets, pursued by officers hanging off the sides of riot trucks and shooting wildly at everyone they saw. it kind of sucked — i have no other words to describe it.

the cycle of violence

after that first terrible weekend, the situation in portland began to stabilize into something predictable. on monday, june 1st, a second mass rally, similar in size to the one on may 31st, assembled at revolution hall near the middle of the city. these people attempted to march to the justice center, but by that point the police had called in for an enormous chain-link fence, to wall it and the federal courthouse off from the rest of the city.

the protest on june 1st was distinctly different from anything that had come before. a new group of inexperienced activists took the wheel, and they placed great emphasis on talking with the police and avoiding any confrontation. in this they were successful, and the crowd marched across the hawthorne bridge, toured downtown, and marched back to revolution hall with barely any sight of police officers.

this would prove to be the beginning of a split within oregon’s protest movement. on one end were more moderate liberal marchers, who sought to avoid conflict with the police while engaging in “peaceful protest.” on the other end were more radical demonstrators, who found the rally on june 1st to be pointless. after this night, the two parts of the movement grew further and further apart.

the more moderate demonstrators coalesced around a new organization called rose city justice, which continued to lead mass demonstrations for the next couple of weeks. most of their marches followed the same basic pattern as the one on june 1st, although they also occupied chunks of highway on several occasions. they succeeded in avoiding conflict with the police, but their numbers rapidly dwindled. on june 30th, they announced an end to their nightly marches.

meanwhile, the more extreme members of the movement gravitated towards a series of nightly protests around the fence walling the justice center and courthouse off from the rest of the city. thanks to a joke i made during a livestream, they began calling it the “sacred fence.” it has a twitter account now.

the rallies at the fence were met with intense police violence from the very beginning. on june 2nd, after another mass rally by the group that became rose city justice, about a thousand activists peeled off and approached the fence. they demanded to be allowed to protest at the justice center, and were forced away from the fence by a barrage of police impact munitions and tear gas.

the crowd reformed, repeatedly, and continued to march on the fence. the police eventually responded by an indiscriminate barrage of grenades, kettling the crowd on all sides with walls of tear gas. the amount of gas used was so overwhelming that a photograph of the resultant nightmare was used for a new york magazine spread:

again, large numbers of motorists stuck in traffic were tear gassed by the police, temporarily blinding a number of them and helping to spark eight lawsuits seeking to ban the use of tear gas by the ppb.

“tear gas tuesday,” as it came to be known, was also the very first night where portland crowds were able to repeatedly reform after being gassed and dispersed by the police. as one activist told me after a particularly heavy bout of gassing, “it’s only really scary the first time. then you get used to it.” the crowd at the sacred fence started to bring more traffic cones to douse gas canisters — they also brought umbrellas and shields to deflect impact munitions. they continued to march on the fence, prompting the police to reduce its size to just covering the area immediately around the justice center and courthouse.

the nightly demonstrations took on a predictable cadence after this. crowds would assemble around the fence and heckle the officers inside. on some nights, the police would choose to start firing impact munitions into the crowd, and eventually gassing them. on other nights, they would not. every use of force was justified by the police due to the crowd throwing something over the fence: fireworks, water bottles, even a can of beans one time. and, apparently, a half-eaten granny smith apple.

more items recovered that were thrown at officers: full beverage cans, bricks, bottles, rocks, food. pic.twitter.com/rtgildcuks — portland police (@portlandpolice) june 6, 2020

the portland police removed their fence on june 15th, as the nightly demonstrations at the justice center had faded down to just a few hundred individuals on a good night. the justice center protests became a regular outlet for activists, a place where someone could always go to have a confrontation with the police. as often as not, the nights there ended in violence.

yet through the latter half of june and into early july, protesters began experimenting with different tactics. some small groups of activists started destroying statues, starting with thomas jefferson and george washington on june 14th and 18th. on june 25th, spurred on by the creation of the seattle autonomous zone, several hundred portland activists attempted to occupy the north precinct before being forced out by tear gas and batons. at one point, portland police broke the window of a protester’s car and pulled them out into a cloud of tear gas.

after being pushed out of the precinct, the crowd set an enormous dumpster fire, which they used to ward off a police advance for several minutes.

for unclear reasons, a small group of activists moved over to the mid-k beauty supply, which abuts the north precinct, and set fire to the plywood covering its windows. this was a contentious decision and angered several members of the crowd. as the police advanced and began to fire tear gas, a larger group of activists beat the fire out before fleeing.

the next day, june 26th, a number of black community leaders in portland issued a statement condemning the demonstration at the north precinct. one of them, pastor dr. steven holt, called the fire at mid-k beauty supply “a terrorist activity.” together with mayor ted wheeler, this group held a press conference in front of the burnt plywood façade of mid-k.

as june ended, portland protest culture settled into an odd rhythm. there were nightly gatherings at the justice center, which sometimes ended in police violence and sometimes ended in parties. several times a week, new rallies at places like the north precinct or the portland police association headquarters would occur. these were often heavily promoted by the anti-fascist group youth liberation front, who are probably the strongest consistent voice for portland’s radical protest scene. on any given day, portlanders could generally find some sort of peaceful rally or, if they choose, wind up in a skirmish with the ppb.

the battle in the courts

on june 11th, a federal judge in portland issued a two-week restraining order on the use of tear gas. this was a partial granting of the request of a local activist group, don’t shoot portland. under the terms of the “ban,” portland police were only able to use gas as a “life-saving measure.” this ban came with a loophole, however. riots are assumed to be life-threatening situations, and so the ppb increasingly started making riot declarations to justify their use of tear gas.

in one five-day period, from june 30th to july 4th, the ppb declared three riots. the justifications for this were often questionable. for example: the rally on june 30th was a march of about three hundred people that ended at the portland police association headquarters. the ppa is portland’s local police union. it is a private entity, but the city seems to deploy significant resources to protect it.

by the time the marchers arrived at the ppa building in north portland, it was surrounded by a riot line, with numerous police vehicles and riot troopers waiting in reserve. the state troopers who guarded the front of the building wore no identifying numbers or name tags. within minutes of the crowd’s arrival, the police declared an unlawful assembly and demanded the crowd disperse. they justified this by citing “criminal activity” in the crowd, but what that meant was unclear.

within an hour, and with no clear justification, the ppb declared a riot and began firing tear gas into both the crowd and the neighborhood around them. local residents were kept out of their homes, and some wound up stuck outside their houses and apartments in the gas cloud.

a few weeks later, on july 14th, a second march again formed up around the portland police association headquarters. on this occasion the riot declaration was made after a police officer slapped the phone out of an activists hand and sent it careening into the window of the ppa building. it broke a window, which the ppb used as justification to declare a riot and deploy tear gas.

so here's the video, from teebsgaming on https://t.co/dafgnlpdl3 , of an officer smacking the phone from a protester's hand into the window of the ppa building. and the broken window is what they then used as their reason to declare a 'riot' and gas people. #portlandprotest pic.twitter.com/x8iqqmfvtx — kboo community radio (@kboo) july 14, 2020

portland police have also been taken to court for their treatment of local journalists. they have regularly targeted press during demonstrations, with the worst night so far being the first protest at the portland police association. three reporters were arrested within the span of a few minutes: cory elia, lesley mclam and justin yau.

video taken by elia shows that his encounter started when he walked past an officer he recognized, john bartlett, and mentioned his name while livestreaming. officer bartlett knocked elia’s phone out of his hands. several minutes later, a group of officers grabbed elia, tossed him to the ground and arrested him. he was charged with two counts of assaulting a police officer.

i filmed elia’s arrest and saw no sign of any resistance. you can judge for yourself here.

justin yau was arrested the same night for filming an arrest himself. he was also charged with felony riot. lesley mclam also initially faced felony charges, but the district attorney rejected these charges. these arrests came after weeks in which portland police assaulted a number of local journalists. sergio olmos was shoved repeatedly by police on the night of june 6th. cory elia was thrown into a wall and kicked while on the ground the same night. reporter donovan farley was assaulted on june 7th while attempting to film an arrest. officers beat him on the legs with truncheons and maced him as he tried to leave.

on july 2nd, less than 48 hours after the march on the ppa building, u.s. district judge michael h. simon issued a temporary restraining order against the city, banning police from arresting or using force on anyone they “know or reasonably should know” was a journalist or legal observer. two weeks later, on july 16th, portland police arrested local reporter andrew jankowski while he was covering a demonstration.

at this point, most of the portland press corps, including myself, are actively suing the portland police bureau. the federal injunction does seem to have moderated their behavior, but at the end of the day the level of the anger of individual officers seems to be the only real factor that determines whether or not a journalist spends the night in jail.

the edge of all-out war

on july 4th, portland’s thirty-ninth consecutive night of protests, more than a thousand people assembled in front of the justice center and federal courthouse downtown. they began launching dozens of commercial-grade fireworks into the concrete facades of both buildings, prompting a response from the police and federal agents inside both buildings.

what followed resembled nothing so much as a medieval siege. the windows of both government buildings had been covered in plywood weeks ago, after the first riots. officers inside fired out through murder holes cut in the plywood, pumping rubber bullets, pepper balls and foam rounds into the crowd, while the crowd formed phalanxes of shield-bearers to protect the men and women launching fireworks back in response. federal agents dumped tear gas into the street, but portland’s frontline activists had long since lost their fear of gas. the feds and the police were eventually forced to sally out with batons to drive the crowd back.

i reported on the fighting in mosul back in 2017, and what happened that night in the streets of portland was, of course, not nearly as brutal or dangerous as actual combat. yet it was about as close as you can get without using live ammunition. at times, dozens of flash-bangs and fireworks would detonate within feet of us over the course of a few minutes. my ears rang for days afterwards. my hands shook. i could not write for days.

the whole situation prompted the first major federal response to portland’s nightly protests. it started in the media, with cbp commissioner mark morgan going on fox news to denounce local activists as “criminals.”

“these are not protesters, these are criminals, who got together and actually brought weapons, they brought shields, they brought frozen water bottles, rocks, lasers, weapons with the intent to destroy a federal building and harm law enforcement officers.”

i take some issue with this, because there was never any real chance of either the federal courthouse or the justice center being seriously damaged by fireworks. both buildings are, at this stage in the protests, essentially fortresses. before federal agents opened fire, activists in the park actually seemed much more interested in shooting fireworks at the justice center, to provide a show for their friends incarcerated inside.

a prisoner inside the justice center began waving out at the crowd, and there was much rejoicing. pic.twitter.com/esvm37omhn — robert evans (the only robert evans) (@iwriteok) july 5, 2020

i also take issue with the next thing mark morgan said:

“one of the criminals, that were actually trying to assault one of the cbp employees while he was being arrested, the report right now is that a pipe bomb- a fused incendiary device and a machete was actually discovered during that search. think about that… think about the deadly consequences from these criminal actions.”

this is rather interesting, because the acting deputy secretary of homeland security actually posted a picture of this “pipe bomb”:

you may notice that this “bomb” has no hole for a fuse. when i showed this to activists on the street, most of them suggested this was probably a device for breaking windows. that seems very likely now that we have the charging document from that weekend. the man with the machete is andrew faulkner. he is charged with assaulting a federal officer by shining a laser pointer at their face. neither he, nor any other portland protester, have faced any charges related to the possession of a pipe bomb.

mark morgan referred to this device, and the other “weapons” of these protesters, as deadly. however, so far, the only person who came close to dying as a result of these demonstrations is donovan labella. on saturday, july 11th, labella attended one of the nightly rallies in front of the justice center. people who were in attendance at the time described the general mood as subdued, and the crowd as passive, when federal agents with the u.s. marshals began charging out to arrest and shoot protesters.

in the video below, donovan can be seen holding a set of speakers above his head. federal agents fire a munition towards him, and he gently tosses it away. he does not throw the munition towards officers, merely away from himself. after this, a federal agent shoots him directly in his skull with a rubber bullet. donovan collapses instantly, his skull shattered.

use of force experts interviewed by oregon live say the agent likely did not intend to hit donovan in the head, “since the risk of serious injury is high.” sid heal, a retired los angeles sheriff’s department commander, stated: “in this particular case, there is no rational way to say that deadly force was authorized.” on july 18th, the new york times reported on a leaked dhs memo which warned that the agents deployed to portland had no training in riot control or managing protests.

on july 10th, one day before donovan was shot, president donald trump had congratulated the head of the department of homeland security, chad wolf, for crushing the protest movement in portland. at a meeting of military commanders in doral, florida he praised wolf by stating: “it was out of control. the locals couldn’t handle it, and you people are handling it very nicely — so nicely that the press doesn’t want to write about it.”

yet of course the protests and riots have continued, even after labella’s brutal maiming. as i type this, hundreds of portlanders are engaged in a series of pitched skirmishes with federal agents and police officers, just as they have been most nights since the end of may. as federal forces have failed to contain the unrest, the trump administration has turned up the heat on their rhetoric. acting secretary wolf visited portland on the 16th. he called protesters “lawless anarchists.” in a statement issued the same day, he wrote that:

“a federal courthouse is a symbol of justice — to attack it is to attack america. instead of addressing violent criminals in their communities, local and state leaders are instead focusing on placing blame on law enforcement and requesting fewer officers in their community. this failed response has only emboldened the violent mob as it escalates violence day after day.”

this is untrue. virtually all crime, including violent crime, has been lower in the city of portland during the last several weeks. the acting secretary’s statement was filled with a number of other inaccuracies as well. the bulk of the letter is a dated list of all the alleged crimes committed by portland protesters, who are generally referred to as “violent anarchists”. under the heading for 07/05/2020:

this is certainly very sneaky. by stating it “appears” to be a pipe bomb the statement avoids addressing the fact that no actual pipe bomb has ever been found and no one has been charged for possession of one. despite the acting secretary wolf’s claims that these demonstrators are intensely violent, the vast majority of the crimes he attributes to them are simple acts of vandalism:

perhaps this will change as the protests continue. but thus far, the only escalation seen recently has been the federal agents now roaming the streets of downtown portland in rented vans, arresting activists seemingly at random. these men display no identification, no name tag or badge number or anything else that might be useful identifying them. that fact has rightly shocked americans across the country, but at this point, it is nothing new to portland protesters.

portland police have been hiding their names for weeks, instead using numbers that cannot be correlated to names by any means available to citizens. members of multiple different law enforcement agencies, all with different rules of engagement from the ppb, have been policing demonstrations since the very beginning. as tuck woodstock, a local reporter, noted on twitter:

“this is the natural escalation of the last 7 weeks. this is what has come of portlanders protesting police brutality for 50 days: more bizarre acts of police brutality. portlanders are risking everything every day. please notice.”

that is, in the end, what both the portland press corps and the people out in the streets, protesting every night, seem to want from the rest of the united states. please pay attention to the videos of officers ripping people’s face masks off to spray mace directly into their mouths. please pay attention to the video of donovan labella, blood gushing from his head, seizing on the ground. and, yes, please pay attention to the videos of men in full combat gear abducting activists off the street.

pay attention, because it is my belief that all of this will not stay confined to portland. your city might be next."

“if the court really believes what it just did, then it just handed president trump a great deal of power, too,” yoo, a professor at berkeley law, said.

“the supreme court has said president obama could [choose not to] enforce immigration laws for about 2 million cases. and why can’t the trump administration do something similar with immigration – create its own … program, but it could do it in areas beyond that, like healthcare, tax policy, criminal justice, inner city policy. i talked to them a fair amount about cities, because of the disorder.”

in a fox news sunday interview, trump declared he would try to use that interpretation to try to force through decrees on healthcare, immigration and “various other plans” over the coming month. the white house consultations with yoo were first reported by the axios news website.

constitutional scholars and human rights activists have also pointed to the deployment of paramilitary federal forces against protesters in portland as a sign that trump is ready to use this broad interpretation of presidential powers as a means to suppress basic constitutional rights.

“this is how it begins,” laurence tribe, a harvard constitutional law professor, wrote on twitter. “the dictatorial hunger for power is insatiable. if ever there was a time for peaceful civil disobedience, that time is upon us.”

yoo became notorious for a legal memo he drafted in august 2002, when he was deputy assistant attorney general in the justice department’s office of legal counsel.

it stated: “necessity or self-defense may justify interrogation methods that might violate” the criminal prohibition on torture.

memos drafted by yoo were used for justifying waterboarding and other forms of torture on terrorism suspects at cia “black sites” around the world.

asked if he now regretted his memos, yoo replied: “i’m still not exactly sure about how far the cia took its interrogation methods but i think if they stayed within the outlines of the legal memos, i think they weren’t violating american law.”

in a book titled defender in chief, due to be published next week, yoo argues that trump was fighting to restore the powers of the presidency, in a way that would have been approved by the framers of the us constitution.

“they wanted each branch to have certain constitutional weapons and then they wanted them to fight. and so they wanted the president to try to expand his powers but they expected also congress to keep fighting with the president,” he said.

in a june article in the national review, he wrote that a supreme court decision that blocked trump’s attempt to repeal barack obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals programme, known as daca and established by executive order, meant trump could do the same thing to achieve his policy goals.

daca suspended deportations of undocumented migrants who arrived in the us as children. as an example of what trump might achieve in the same way, yoo suggested the president could declare a national right to carry firearms openly, in conflict with many state laws.

“he could declare that he would not enforce federal firearms laws,” yoo wrote, “and that a new ‘trump permit’ would free any holder of state and local gun-control restrictions.

“even if trump knew that his scheme lacked legal authority, he could get away with it for the length of his presidency,” he said. in a telephone interview, he added: “according to the supreme court, the president can now choose to under-enforce the law in certain areas and it can’t be undone by his successor unless that successor goes through this onerous thing called the administrative procedure act, which usually takes one to two years.”

constitutional scholars have rejected yoo’s arguments as ignoring limits on the executive powers of the president imposed by the founders, who were determined to prevent the rise of a tyrant.

tribe called yoo’s interpretation of the daca ruling “indefensible”.

he added: “i fear that this lawless administration will take full advantage of the fact that judicial wheels grind slowly and that it will be difficult to keep up with the many ways trump, aided and abetted by bill barr as attorney general and chad wolf as acting head of homeland security, can usurp congressional powers and abridge fundamental rights in the immigration space in particular but also in matters of public health and safety.”

on the deployment of federal paramilitary units against portland, yoo said he did not know enough of the facts to deem whether it was an abuse of executive power.

“it has to be really reasonably related to protecting federal buildings,” he said. “if it’s just graffiti, that’s not enough. it really depends on what the facts are.”

alka pradhan, a defence counsel in the 9/11 terrorism cases against inmates in the guantánamo bay prison camp, said: “john yoo’s so-called reasoning has always been based on ‘what can the president get away with?’ rather than ‘what is the purpose and letter of the law?’

“that is not legal reasoning, it’s inherently tyrannical and anti-democratic.”

pradhan and other defence lawyers in the pre-trial hearings at the guantánamo bay military tribunal have argued that the use of torture against their clients, made possible by yoo’s 2002 memo, invalidated much of the case against them.

“the fact that john yoo is employed and free to opine on legal matters is an example of the culture of impunity in the united states,” she said."
Ohio House Speaker Arrested In Connection With $60 Million Bribery Scheme,378,hvczsj,https://www.npr.org/2020/07/21/893493224/ohio-house-speaker-arrested-in-connection-to-60-million-bribery-scheme,34,1595385331.0,,"ohio house speaker arrested in connection with $60 million bribery scheme

updated at 6:19 p.m. et

fbi agents arrested ohio house speaker larry householder on tuesday morning at his rural farm. householder was taken into custody in connection with a $60 million bribery scheme allegedly involving state officials and associates.

four others were also arrested: former ohio republican party chairman matt borges, householder adviser jeffrey longstreth and lobbyists neil clark and juan cespedes.

the charges are linked to a controversial law passed last year that bailed out two nuclear power plants in the state while gutting subsidies for renewable energy and energy efficiency.

the federal complaint describes a years-long bribery campaign to build support for householder's bid to become house speaker and then pass the nuclear bailout law with his help. householder won the speakership in january 2019, and the bailout passed in july 2019. it went into effect in october.

householder, a republican, represents a district east of columbus. he first began serving in the ohio house in 1997 and was speaker from 2001 to 2004, when he stepped down because of term limits. he then worked as perry county auditor before returning to the house in 2017.

householder, longstreth, clark, borges and cespedes were each charged with ""conspiracy to participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity."" the charge carries a maximum of 20 years in prison.

the criminal complaint also charges generation now, which it describes as ""a 501(c)(4) entity secretly controlled by householder.""

federal prosecutors say that between march 2017 and march 2020, entities related to an unnamed company — but that would appear to be nuclear power company firstenergy solutions — paid approximately $60 million to householder's generation now.

""make no mistake, this is larry householder's 501 (c)(4),"" u.s. attorney david devillers told reporters on tuesday. the money from the scheme was spent to the detriment of other political candidates and the people of ohio, devillers said.

members of householder's enterprise used those payments for their own personal benefit and to gain support for householder's bid to become speaker, prosecutors say.

""in the spring and fall of 2018, the enterprise spent millions in company a money to support house candidates involved in primary and general elections whom the enterprise believed both would vote for householder as speaker and, ultimately, would follow his lead as speaker and vote for bailout legislation for company a,"" the complaint states.

in exchange for payments, prosecutors say, householder and his associates helped pass house bill 6, then worked to ensure it went into effect by defeating a ballot initiative.

the plan worked. the complaint says householder-backed candidates that benefited from money from generation now helped to elect householder as the speaker. house bill 6 was introduced three months into his term – legislation worth $1.3 billion to company a.

regular payments to householder's secret company from company a began in march 2017, a couple months after he took a trip on company a's private jet, according to the federal complaint. but the payments got much bigger after the legislation was introduced: in may 2019, while the bill was pending before lawmakers, company a allegedly wired $8 million to generation now.

householder and his associates used some of the money on mailers and advertising to support the legislation, and some of it for their own benefit, prosecutors say.

the bill was passed by a vote of 51-38. after the bill was signed into law by gov. mike dewine, a campaign began to organize a ballot initiative to overturn the law. company a-controlled accounts responded by wiring $38 million to householder's company between july and october 2019.

in total, company a allegedly paid the householder enterprise $60 million over a three-year period, in exchange for the billion-dollar-bailout.

prosecutors say the payments were ""akin to bags of cash – unlike campaign or pac contributions, they were not regulated, not reported, not subject to public scrutiny—and the enterprise freely spent the bribe payments to further the enterprise's political interests and to enrich themselves.""

prosecutors say that while there are no charges yet against company a, the investigation is ongoing.

firstenergy solutions, the nuclear power plant company, was renamed energy harbor after it emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. the akron-based company employs about 2,600 people, according to financial disclosures from february.

""we are reviewing the complaint and will cooperate fully with the government's investigation,"" energy harbor said in a statement to npr.

at a tuesday court hearing, the defendants were ordered to surrender any firearms and to remain within the southern district of ohio. they are barred from communicating with anyone who may become a witness in the trial, including the other men charged tuesday. those with passports were ordered to surrender them. preliminary hearings are set for early august.

householder has faced scrutiny before. in 2004, there were reports of his engaging in alleged corrupt activity, though he was never charged.

gov. mike dewine called for householder's resignation after the charges were announced on tuesday afternoon.

""i am deeply concerned about the allegations of wrongdoing issued today by the u.s. attorney's office,"" dewine tweeted. ""because of the nature of these charges, it will be impossible for speaker householder to effectively lead the ohio house of representatives; therefore, i am calling on speaker householder to resign immediately. this is a sad day for ohio.""

last year's nuclear bailout law tacked on a charge to residents' power bills, sending $150 million a year to the nuclear power plants. they are owned by the company energy harbor, which was previously known as firstenergy solutions.

the law also included a subsidy for two coal plants.

npr member station wosu reported that firstenergy contributed more than $150,000 to ohio house republicans in the run-up to the 2018 election — including over $25,000 in donations to householder's campaign.

""according to the state lobbyist database, energy harbor is the only client listed for cespedes,"" wosu reported. ""borges also worked as a lobbyist for firstenergy solutions, while longstreth is connected to generation now, which campaigned against the bailout referendum.""

the american wind energy association called for an inquiry into the circumstances of house bill 6's passage.

""it now appears that the passage of this bill was not just against the will of the people, but also may have involved serious and possibly criminal impropriety,"" said andrew gohn, the association's eastern state affairs director, in a statement. ""we call for a full examination of the circumstances surrounding this attack on clean energy and for gov. dewine and the legislature to pause implementation of hb 6 and ultimately repeal this harmful and regressive legislation."""
Economists Think Congress Should Keep Paying Unemployed Workers $600 A Week — Or Even More,17,hvdh5m,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-think-congress-should-keep-paying-unemployed-workers-600-a-week-or-even-more/,5,1595386856.0,,"congress is back in session, and it has a weighty task before it — figuring out what to do about the economy as covid-19 infections spike across the country and states roll back their reopenings. one central point of tension: the $600-per-week supplemental unemployment insurance benefit that was enacted in march as part of the cares act and is set to expire on july 31.

democrats have proposed extending the payment until jobless rates in states fall below a certain threshold. republicans, meanwhile, are leery of continuing the full payments, saying they will discourage people from returning to work. and it’s true that research has shown that many workers are making more money on the beefed-up benefits than they would be at their old jobs.

but in the latest installment of our regular survey of quantitative macroeconomic economists, conducted in partnership with the initiative on global markets at the university of chicago booth school of business, the 33 economists in our study collectively thought there was a 59 percent chance that either keeping the payment steady or increasing it to above $600 per week would be most beneficial to the economy. they said there was about a 33 percent chance that reducing the weekly payment to less than $600 would most benefit the economy, and only a 7 percent chance that letting the program completely lapse would be most beneficial. this makes sense considering that another recent igm survey found that most economists blamed high unemployment on companies that weren’t hiring — not on people choosing not to work because of unemployment payments.

jonathan wright, an economics professor at johns hopkins university who has been consulting with fivethirtyeight on the design of the survey, pointed out that some extension of unemployment insurance is important because many workers are still out of a job. states can continue to offer benefits regardless of what the federal government does, but those don’t last forever, either — and some states are less generous than others.

how should congress handle unemployment insurance? likelihood that each federal policy choice would most benefit the entire economy over the rest of 2020, according to economists option probability keep the weekly payment at $600 37% reduce the weekly payment to less than $600 33 increase the weekly payment to more than $600 22 allow federal pandemic unemployment insurance to completely lapse 7 the survey of 33 economists was conducted july 17-20. source: fivethirtyeight/igm covid-19 economic survey

of course, the perspectives on congress’s response are nuanced, and many of the economists think the benefits should ideally be phased out as the economy improves, assuming there are no logistical hurdles. when we drilled into some of the ways that federal policymakers could aid jobless workers, the experts thought there was a 37 percent chance that the best strategy would be to continue paying jobless workers $600 weekly for now but peg federal unemployment benefits to key economic indicators so they become gradually less generous as the economy improves. they said there was a 26 percent chance it would benefit the economy more if the workers were paid less than $600 per week for a fixed period of time, and a 22 percent probability that it would be better to continue paying jobless workers $600 a week even if it meant some would make more than they did while working.

deborah lucas, an economist at mit, said she would opt for temporarily leaving the weekly payment at $600, or even increasing it a bit, although she said the payments should ramp down if the economy improved enough. “the fact that a considerable number of people are making more this way than when they were working seems like a good thing,” she said, adding that this will only be true for low earners, who might otherwise feel pressure to take jobs that would endanger their health. “in effect, it enhances social insurance protections and is a step towards universal basic income, both policies i think would improve social welfare even in the absence of a pandemic.”

[related: where the latest covid-19 models think we’re headed — and why they disagree]

not all of the economists were a fan of expanding or maintaining the $600 weekly payment, though. annette vissing-jørgensen, an economist at the university of california, berkeley, said it was fundamentally unfair that some essential workers were making less money than nonessential workers who were out of a job. she added that while she’s concerned overall about making it more financially attractive for workers to stay home from their jobs, particularly if hiring starts to pick up again, there “could be a role for continuing some level of extra benefits” in states that are less generous. others noted that while the extra payment made sense as a short-term stimulus measure, economists might approach the long-term consequences of such a generous supplement differently.

still, it was notable that the least popular response to the question above was an alternative to the $600-per-week payment that’s been floated by some republicans, who have proposed a “back to work bonus” for people who return to their jobs instead of continuing to supplement workers’ unemployment benefits. economists thought there was only a 16 percent chance this would do the most to benefit the economy.

“continued unemployment support has the twin benefits of alleviating poverty for jobless workers and sustaining consumer demand in the economy,” said allan timmermann, professor of finance and economics at the university of california, san diego. timmermann has also been consulting with us on the survey. “[it] is viewed as a highly effective tool to prevent the economy from stalling.”

along similar lines, we asked economists how they would allocate $1 trillion in a hypothetical covid-19 stimulus package if they wanted to do the most good for the entire economy (with the assumption that the health crisis itself would be addressed with a separate bill). the economists ranked their top three priorities and gave unemployment insurance the highest share of no. 1 responses. but though that benefit was in the top three of priorities for a majority of the experts, at 67 percent, it didn’t see the highest share of overall top-three responses. by that measure, the clear priority according to economists was funding state and local governments — which is consistent with a previous survey in which they thought one of the most likely causes of economic disaster would be an unwillingness to bail out those governments. in this week’s survey, 85 percent of respondents thought that should be among lawmakers’ top three priorities, and 36 percent said it should be no. 1.

what should be the priorities of a federal stimulus? priorities for a hypothetical federal stimulus package in order to have the greatest overall economic benefit, ranked by economists share of economists who ranked it as priority … category no. 1 no. 2 no. 3 in top 3 state and local governments 36% 21% 27% 85% jobless workers (via unemployment insurance) 39 15 12 67 small businesses 6 21 21 48 public k-12 schools 12 15 18 45 individuals (via stimulus checks) 3 21 12 36 health care institutions 0 6 9 15 other 3 0 0 3 higher education 0 0 0 0 large corporations 0 0 0 0 the survey of 33 economists was conducted july 17-20. source: fivethirtyeight/igm covid-19 economic survey

“state and local is going to be a huge drag on the economy because they are a sizable share of spending, cannot really run much in the way of deficits, their tax revenue is badly hit and congress has done little to help so far,” wright said. so cushioning states and localities could do a lot to support the economy, he said.

other areas of focus that frequently came up among the economists’ top three priorities were funding for small businesses (48 percent) and public k-12 schools (45 percent) and another round of individual stimulus checks (36 percent). none of our economists, however, thought funding either large corporations or colleges and other institutions of higher learning was a priority.

in addition to our usual questions about gross domestic product in the second and fourth quarters, we asked the economists to forecast third-quarter real gdp growth in this installment of the survey. the results shed some light on just how much the prospect of a true “second wave” of coronavirus in the winter could slow down economic growth.

on average, economists thought real gdp in the second quarter of 2020 — which ended june 30, with an advance gdp estimate set to be released later this month — declined by an annualized rate of 27 percent compared with the first quarter. they also thought real gdp would grow by about 8 percentage points quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter, with an upper-bound estimate of 17 percent and little chance of negative growth again. but their forecasts looked bleaker for the fourth quarter, with a median forecast of 3 percent growth, a 90th-percentile forecast of 9 percent and a 10th-percentile forecast in the red again (at -3 percent) — all more pessimistic than in the third quarter.

some of that reflects the increased economic activity of the summer (relative to the early spring), even with the virus circulating around the country; the likelihood of some kind of third-quarter bounce back was high, given how bad economists think second-quarter gdp will end up. but the forecast also speaks to the uncertain course that the virus — and therefore, the economy — might take over the rest of 2020.

[related: how americans view the coronavirus crisis and trump’s response]

robert barbera, an economist at johns hopkins university, said part of the problem in forecasting quarterly shifts is that month-to-month change can be so extreme. his forecast for the third quarter was less optimistic because he expected most of the initial bounce back to happen in may and june, which are both part of the second quarter. the third quarter might see an uptick in august and september and look quite a bit better than the second quarter, he said, but that’s partially because the second quarter was so bad. predicting the fourth quarter is even more difficult — in part because a bounce back in the economy is so dependent on americans’ willingness to resume ordinary life.

however the course of the recession plays out, our economists think america could be due for a massive wave of personal bankruptcies in the second half of the year. during the first half of 2020, total bankruptcy filings — the vast majority of which were by individuals — were actually down 23 percent relative to the first half of 2019, according to court data from epiq aacer. but don’t be fooled: that was almost certainly because of the heavy use of grace periods and extensions by creditors, which will eventually expire (if they haven’t already). in our survey, 67 percent of economists thought total filings would increase significantly in the second half of 2020 relative to the second half of 2019; only 6 percent thought they would see the same kind of year-over-year decrease in the second half of 2020 that they saw in the first half.

taken as a whole, the economic picture painted by this week’s survey is no brighter than in previous installments. the panel’s predictions for future gdp have scarcely budged over the past two weeks, and the experts remain wary that whatever gains the economy is making over the summer could be wiped out by the virus before year’s end. but they also clearly think congress has a few tools at its disposal to avoid making the recovery harder than it needs to be. the big question is — will policymakers use them?

the memorandum marks the trump administration's latest effort to change the way us populations are counted and advance the president's immigration agenda. and like previous efforts, the issue will end up in court.

""i have accordingly determined that respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base, to the extent feasible and to the maximum extent of the president's discretion under the law,"" the order states.

[Opinion] Let's stop the nonsense about federal agents in Portland,0,hvhcop,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/508227-lets-stop-the-nonsense-about-federal-agents-in-portland,42,1595399098.0,,"there have been conflicting reports about federal agents in camouflage and unmarked vehicles detaining protesters in portland, ore., without cause. this comes on the heels of scenes of federal officers, outfitted in blue shirts and tactical vests but no official patches or badges, protecting facilities in washington, d.c., in june. the events have called into question the role of federal law enforcement and how it intersects with traditional policing.

while many federal law enforcement agencies are investigative in nature and have special agents, not police officers, some do have a more traditional police role. the secret service uniformed division has been in operation since 1922 and provides traditional law enforcement services around the white house and foreign embassies in the u.s. its agents conduct operations around the president and other dignitaries, including k-9, explosive ordnance disposal, and counter-assault teams. the capitol police is approximately 1,500 police officers strong and functions much like a traditional police department. many other agencies have uniformed police officers as well, including the fbi, whose police officers protect the agency’s headquarters, fbi academy in quantico, va., and its enormous field offices in washington and new york.

for all the controversy that surrounds j. edgar hoover today, the longtime fbi director, who died nearly a half-century ago, strongly opposed the notion of establishing a national police force. it was a primary motive for hoover’s setting up the fbi national academy (fbina) in 1935. not to be confused with the academy that trains new fbi special agents, the fbina created the first executive training for police supervisors, some of whom were the only members of their departments to receive any formal training long ago. today, the fbina remains the gold standard for senior police officers who lead departments across the country and the world.

the federal building and courthouse in portland have been under assault by demonstrators for more than two weeks. in addition to the “mere graffiti” that opponents of the federal response have pointed to, there has been substantial damage to windows and doors; protesters have attempted to set fire to the facility; and federal agents attempting to stop the violence have been assaulted while the protestors blind them with laser lights. portland mayor ted wheeler has sided with the protesters and told portland police to back down. last week he told the acting homeland security secretary chad wolfchad wolffederal official says voting security remains strong as polls begin to close hillicon valley: officials express confidence in voting security amid early technical glitches | unidentified robocall told millions to 'stay home' ahead of election day: report | qanon's danger rises with divisive election voters line up at polls as country braces for results more to send the federal agents away.

while all americans cherish the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances, what’s happening in oregon is not that. most jurisdictions, portland included, require protesters to apply for a permit and comply with laws and regulations relating to protest activity. but in recent weeks, police response in cities such as seattle, portland and new york has been to allow protesters to flagrantly break the law without recourse. a protester who assaulted the new york police department chief of department during a demonstration on the brooklyn bridge on thursday leaving him bloodied, was released without bail.

the federal government is sovereign to the states and does not need a governor’s or mayor’s permission to enforce federal law. if local police will not protect federal property, the federal government can. contrary to some media reports, the federal agents making arrests in portland can be seen wearing identifying patches on their uniforms, with “police” emblazoned on their vests, and acting commissioner mark morgan has confirmed they are customs and border protection (cbp) agents. the agents have appeared in rented, unmarked vans because they are on temporary duty assignments in portland; it’s not an effort to keep their identities secret.

critics have pointed to arrests made by these agents away from the federal courthouse as evidence they are rounding up “innocent protesters.” federal agents are not precluded from making probable-cause arrests, or arrests based on warrants, away from federal property. since many of these federal teams have been in place for weeks, it is likely they have arrest packages on individuals accused of previously committing crimes who are now being identified through investigations. in several videos, agents can be seen bypassing individuals to arrest persons of apparent interest; these appear to be targeted operations, not the roundup of innocents.

all of law enforcement is accountable to the citizens by way of their elected officials. if the people of portland, seattle and new york are fine with having anarchy in their streets, they can continue to vote for politicians who handcuff the police and back them down. if the rest of the country wants federal law enforcement to look like that, too, they can vote that way in november. in the meantime, however, the hyperbolic references comparing u.s. federal agents to guantanamo bay, stormtroopers and nazis should stop.

james m. casey was a police officer and fbi agent for 32 years. in 2004-2005 he was assigned to the national security council as a director of intelligence, and he retired in 2012 as special agent in charge of the fbi’s jacksonville division. he is president of fcs global advisors, a private investigative and crisis management firm."

president trump has a message for suburban voters. and it's not a subtle one.

""they want to destroy our suburbs,"" trump recently warned in a call with supporters.

""people have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they're going to watch it go to hell,"" he said from the south lawn of the white house.

trump has been issuing increasingly dire and outlandish warnings about what democrats will do to the suburbs. he warns suburbanites will face rising crime and falling home values if they elect joe biden.

the message: be afraid, be very afraid.

the newest ad from trump's campaign is a very dramatic dramatization of an older white woman calling 911 when she sees an intruder. but no one is there to answer her call for help. as she is attacked, the words ""you won't be safe in joe biden's america"" flash on the screen.

trump campaign youtube

this is all based on the false claim that biden wants to defund the police. biden has specifically said he doesn't want to defund the police. his campaign says these are ""smears"" that aren't working.

from july 1 to july 20, trump's campaign spent more than $18 million on television ads hitting this theme, according to the tracking firm ad analytics. it's a similar argument to one trump made ahead of the 2018 midterms, that caravans of migrants would cross the border bringing gangs and crime. democrats won control of the house in a wave election, led by a suburban backlash to trump.

""people are not afraid of what he's trying to make them afraid of,"" said christine matthews, a republican pollster who has been critical of trump.

in 2016, voters in the suburbs made up 50% of the electorate. trump won those voters narrowly that year. now polls show him trailing biden badly in the suburbs.

trump hadn't explicitly addressed suburban voters until about a month ago, when, in a speech to young supporters gathered at a phoenix megachurch, trump, referring to racial justice protests in seattle, said it was bedlam.

""that's exactly what will come to every city near you, every suburb and community in america, if the radical-left democrats are put in charge,"" trump claimed.

from there, the appeals to suburban voters and his ideas about what issues matter to them have only gotten more direct. trump has pushed for schools to reopen, threatening to pull funding if they don't, without explaining how it can be done safely while coronavirus cases spike. and he has targeted an obama-era fair housing regulation, promising to sign an executive order halting it.

the 2015 regulation deals with racial segregation of housing and requires local municipalities to address historic patterns of it. but trump warned last week that it would ""destroy"" the suburbs.

""your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise,"" he said. ""people have worked all their lives to get into a community, and now they're going to watch it go to hell. not going to happen, not while i'm here.""

that kind of racial view, pitting whites in the suburbs against blacks and latinos who might move in, is an appeal that seems to stem from an anachronistic view of the suburbs.

""he thinks it's basically the planned development of levittown in the 1960s as opposed to today's suburbs, which are multiracial, diverse and highly educated,"" matthews said.

many suburban voters do think liberal activists have overstepped, said ryan costello, a former republican congressman from the pennsylvania suburbs. but, he added, they don't ascribe that to biden, and they don't think he is going to defund their local police departments.

costello said that right now, people in the suburbs are worried about schools opening safely, with the emphasis on safely. they're worried about the coronavirus and the economy.

""this is really a referendum on how president trump is handling the pandemic,"" costello said. ""that's the kind of stuff that suburban voters that don't have a deep partisan allegiance are going to look at. and that's where they're going to render their value judgments.""

and so far, americans largely disapprove of the job trump is doing handling the coronavirus. on average, 58% now say they disapprove of it.

costello announced his retirement from the house of representatives in 2018 rather than face near-certain defeat in a wave led by suburban backlash to trump. he questions the logic of the president's current political strategy.

""if you're going to attack an opponent, there has to be something that is relatable in that attack on an opponent,"" costello said. ""i live in the suburbs, and i don't know how he would eliminate the suburbs. it doesn't make much sense to me.""

the trump campaign is downplaying this erosion of a key group that helped with his win in 2016.

""president trump brought new voters into the republican party in 2016 and has realigned the political electorate, creating a broad coalition of support across all demographics that will carry him to victory in november,"" trump campaign deputy national press secretary samantha zager said in an email when asked about biden's apparent lead in the suburbs.

in 2016, trump brought in a surge of rural white voters, who don't live in the suburbs but may respond to his messages about urban crime and the dangers of the left.

""what does suburban really mean?"" ernest mcgowen, an associate professor of political science at the university of richmond, asked rhetorically. ""what does it mean as a thing? is it a geography, or is it an identity?

mcgowen, who has studied african americans in the suburbs and lives in the suburbs himself, says that suburban identity is about accomplishment, but not excess. in the suburbs, you know your kids will go to good schools with extracurricular activities. you'll need a lawnmower.

and mcgowen points out, that doesn't mean you are all that close to the city anymore. the suburbs have expanded into what used to be rural areas.

""what we're calling a suburb now is going to be part of the metro in a few years,"" mcgowen said. ""and what we're calling exurbs is going to actually be the suburbs as we would know them.""

the suburbs are again shaping up to be where 2020 could be won or lost."
Kansas school board rejects delaying in-person K-12 classes,80,hw2lr9,https://apnews.com/6a64799654f6a9ccb944299898f8d367,6,1595482206.0,,"gov. laura kelly puts on a mask during a press conference monday, july 20, 2020. gov. kelly signed an executive order monday that mandates the use of masks in schools, daily temperature checks and hand sanitizer in each classroom.

topeka, kan. (ap) — kansas schools will be allowed to reopen in mid-august after republican officials on wednesday again thwarted a plan from democratic gov. laura kelly aimed at reversing a resurgence in reported coronavirus cases.

the gop-controlled state board of education on wednesday voted 5-5 and rejected a proposal from kelly to delay the restart of k-12 classes for three weeks until after labor day. decisions on when school buildings reopen will be left to the state’s 286 local elected boards.

republican officials and conservatives outside state government have argued that it’s inappropriate for kelly to impose “one size fits all” pandemic measures. top republicans in the gop-controlled legislature made similar arguments for weeks to pressure kelly into lifting statewide restrictions on businesses and public gathering, which she did may 26.

the growth in kansas’ reported coronavirus cases had bottomed out in early june but began climbing again until the state recently saw its worst spikes of the pandemic. reported cases have more than doubled in six weeks, exceeding 24,000 as of wednesday, with more than 300 covid-19-related deaths.

kelly said in a statement that its vote “puts our students, faculty, their families and our economy at risk.” the state’s top public health official, dr. lee norman, warned the board that children can be ”very active disease spreaders.”

“a school cannot be a safe island in an unsafe community where there is a marked increase in the number of cases,” norman said.

the board had an emergency zoom meeting. republican member jim porter, of fredonia, who supported kelly’s order, suggested it was ironic to debate the wisdom of reopening schools “from the comfort and safety of our own homes.”

the board’s action prevents kelly from issuing an executive order setting sept. 9 as the start of classes for both public schools and private ones that are accredited by the state. the governor already had ordered them to have students and staff wear masks and have them checked daily for fever, and those mandates still stand.

kansas also has a long tradition of letting local school districts set their own schedules and decide what’s taught and how their buildings operate. the state board approved 1,100 pages of guidelines for reopening schools last week but did not impose mandates.

as of wednesday, coronavirus cases had been reported in all 105 of the state’s counties except for two sparsely populated rural ones in western kansas, rawlins and wallace counties. but infection rates vary widely, with only 15 counties above the state’s figure of 8.27 reported cases for every 1,000 residents and 67 with fewer than 4 for every 1,000 residents.

“our state is extremely diverse,” senate president susan wagle, a wichita republican, said after the board’s vote. “the democratic process and engagement from many kansans prevailed today.”

wagle and the small-government, free-market kansas policy institute think tank had publicly urged people to lobby the board to reject kelly’s order. board members said they received thousands of calls and emails from all points of view.

republicans have an 8-2 board majority on the board and kelly needed four gop votes to prevail. her plan received three.

the board’s vote wednesday was required under a state law enacted last month as a compromise between kelly and gop lawmakers who pushed to curb her power.

many republicans have argued that kelly was too slow to reopen the state’s economy after locking it down for five weeks starting in late march. some also were critical when she ordered all k-12 school buildings closed in mid-march for the rest of the last school year.

educators agree that children benefit from interacting with each other and that in-person classes generally are better for instruction than online classes.

board member michelle dombrosky, an olathe republican who opposed kelly’s order, suggested that delaying the start of the new school year would hurt the “least fortunate” students most.

“we’re giving parents the choices,” she said. “this needs to be a local decision.”

but it wasn’t clear that all local districts could be ready to reopen schools in mid-august. five superintendents in johnson county in the kansas city area, the state’s most populous county, urged the state board to delay the start of fall classes given “the complexity of these issues” related to the pandemic.

“you have various constituencies, parents and teachers unions and others, who have interests in the decisions,” said david smith, a spokesman for one the shawnee mission district in johnson county. “now, we are going to have to wrestle with all of those interests and figure out, given the fact that we don’t have an order, what makes the most sense.”

the state health department reported wednesday that kansas has had 24,104 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, which was an increase of 770, or 3.3%, since monday. it also reported one additional covid-19-related fatality since then, raising the state’s death toll to 308, though johns hopkins university pegs that figure at 317.

“i want to be on the right side of history on this one,” said board member ann mah, a topeka democrat who supported the governor’s proposed delay.

Trump Reportedly Told Diplomat To Push U.K. Government To Steer Golf Tournament To His Resort.,62,hwakq3,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/07/21/trump-reportedly-told-diplomat-to-push-uk-government-to-steer-golf-tournament-to-his-resort/amp/,5,1595513605.0,,"topline

u.s. ambassador to the united kingdom robert “woody” johnson told colleagues that president trump pressured him in 2018 to entreat the british government to move the british open golf tournament to the trump turnberry resort in scotland, the new york times reported tuesday.

key facts

“mr. johnson apparently felt pressured to try,” the times reported, citing three people with knowledge of the incident. johnson reportedly broached the subject weeks later with then-british secretary of state for scotland david mundell against the advice of johnson’s deputy, lewis a. lukens, who was forced out months later. mundell told the times it would be “inappropriate” to comment on the story and the british government said johnson, “made no request of mr. mundell regarding the british open or any other sporting event,” but didn’t say whether he mentioned turnberry. “the episode left mr. lukens and other diplomats deeply unsettled,” the times reported, with johnson reportedly emailing several state department officials about it. the white house declined to comment to forbes or the times.

chief critic

“it is diplomatic malpractice because once you do that, you put yourself in a compromised position,” former obama ethics czar norman eisen told the times. “they can always say, ‘remember that time when you made that suggestion.’ no experienced diplomat would do that.”

key background

the story comes as the latest in a long line of allegations that trump has used the presidency to benefit his businesses. trump’s hotel in d.c. has come under legal scrutiny centered around its alleged use as a vehicle for lobbying the white house by visiting foreign dignitaries. the story is also not the first alleged impropriety centered around turnberry. politico reporter natasha bertrand reported in september 2019 that air national guard crews made abnormal stops at the resort, potentially transferring millions to the trump organization from defense department coffers. more recently, trump floated the possibility of hosting the g7 at his doral resort in florida, which was also rumored to be discussed as a possible venue for the republican convention.

news peg

while trump cannot be prosecuted under conflict-of-interest laws that govern the actions of other government officials, he is subject to the emoluments clause of the constitution, which prohibits federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments. “experts on government ethics pointed to one potential violation of the emoluments clause that still may have been triggered by the president’s actions,” the times reported. “the british or scottish governments would most likely have to pay for security at the tournament, an event that would profit mr. trump.”

Trump announces 'surge' of federal officers into Democratic-run cities,337,hwg5me,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/22/donald-trump-federal-officers-police-surge-chicago,106,1595541652.0,,"donald trump has announced a “surge” of hundreds of law enforcement officers into democratic-run cities including chicago, drawing condemnation from civil liberties watchdogs.

the us president’s move came after a crackdown by federal agents on anti-racism protesters in portland, oregon, and was consistent with his emphasis on “law and order” as a key component of his reelection campaign.

“today, i’m announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into american communities plagued by violent crime,” trump said at the white house on wednesday. “we’ll work every single day to restore public safety, protect our nation’s children and bring violent perpetrators to justice.”

the aggressive move renewed fears of an expanding state security apparatus threatening the rights of peaceful demonstrators. the american civil liberties union tweeted: “we will continue to defend our constitutional rights from trump’s lawlessness – in portland, chicago, and wherever else necessary.”

with just over a hundred days until the presidential election, trump has argued that violence would worsen if his democratic rival, joe biden, is elected. he cast the latest move in starkly political partisan terms.

“my administration will be working to remove dangerous offenders sprung loose by these deadly policies and, frankly, by these deadly politicians,” he said. “america must be a sanctuary for law-abiding citizens, not criminal aliens. my vision for america’s cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left.”

the fbi, drug enforcement administration, us marshals service and department of homeland security would all send agents to chicago, trump added, giving a lengthy description of recent violence in america’s third biggest city and accusing its democratic leaders of failing residents.

“no mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city,” he said.

the announcement pits trump against lori lightfoot, the mayor of chicago, who has made clear her opposition to federal intervention.

“under no circumstances will i allow donald trump’s troops to come to chicago and terrorize our residents,” she tweeted on tuesday.

yet on wednesday, the president denied the initiative was a political stunt and claimed chicago actually wanted his help. “the cities, unfortunately, that are in trouble are all run by democrats. you have radical left democrats running cities like chicago and so many others … unfortunately, that’s the way it is. i mean, that’s the facts.

“mayor lightfoot sent me a letter yesterday, and i think, in their own way, they want us to go in. there’ll be a time when they’re going to want us to go in full blast, but right now we’re sending extra people to help. we’re arresting a lot of people that have been very bad.”

he added: “she’s a democrat. she’s making a big mistake. people are dying in chicago and other cities, and we can solve the problem.”

a reporter challenged trump over why he blamed his predecessor, barack obama, for a rise in crime in chicago in 2016, yet does not accept responsibility now. he replied: “because president obama was invited in, and he did a poor job. president obama could have gone into chicago. he could have solved the problem, and he didn’t. in our case, they don’t want us in. we can solve the problem very easily.”

the president and william barr, the attorney general, also announced on wednesday that two dozen agents would be dispatched to albuquerque, new mexico.

barr said: “today, we have extended operation legend to chicago and albuquerque to protect the residents of those cities from senseless acts of deadly violence by targeting those involved in gang activity and those who use guns to commit violent crime.”

the justice department says chicago is experiencing a significant increase in violent crime, with murders currently up 51% over 2019, while albuquerque is on pace to break 2019’s record for murders in the city.

martin heinrich, a democratic senator for new mexico, condemned the intervention. “instead of collaborating with the albuquerque police department, the sheriff is inviting the president’s stormtroopers into albuquerque,” he said.

the president has linked the growing violence in the streets with protests against racial injustice in what critics say is a ploy to stoke fears in predominantly white suburbs. experts in criminal justice say the rise in crime is more complex, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and economic slump.

the unrest in portland only grew after federal agents in camouflage were seen taking people away in unmarked cars without probable cause. several lawsuits have been filed questioning the federal government’s authority to use broad policing powers in cities.

democratic mayors of 15 cities, including portland, have condemned the use of the agents in a letter to barr and the acting homeland security secretary, chad wolf.

the announcement on wednesday marked an expansion of a justice department programme launched by barr on 8 july. “operation legend” was initially devised to address violent crime in kansas city, missouri, and named after legend taliferro, a four-year-old boy fatally shot there last month. the first federal arrest under operation legend was announced on monday.

leon panetta, a former defence secretary and cia director, said: “one of the last holdouts for tyrants is to try to have the military be able to protect them, and that fear that he may try to do that raises a lot of concerns about just how far will he go to try to ‘take over’ a lot of these cities and states in terms of their ability to conduct law enforcement on their own.”

panetta added: “it’s interesting, because federalism has always been a calling card for republicans to avoid having the federal government impose its will on states and communities. to have a president who’s prepared to send federal officers into these communities i think represents a step that ought to not only create fear in the people that are impacted by that decision, but should raise a hell of a lot of fear for those republicans who have defended federalism most of their lives.”"
Texas county stores bodies in trucks as state sets one-day record for COVID-19 deaths,309,hwjoxu,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/texas-county-stores-bodies-in-trucks-as-state-sets-one-day-record-for-covid-19-deaths-idUSKCN24N2F2,20,1595553407.0,,"(reuters) - texas on wednesday set one-day records for increases in covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations in the state, forcing one county to store bodies in refrigerated trucks and prompting a top health official there to call for new stay-at-home orders.

texas, which reported 197 deaths and 10,893 hospitalizations, has been one of the states hardest hit by the resurgent coronavirus. hidalgo county, at the southern tip of the state on the u.s. border with mexico, has seen cases rise 60 percent in the last week, according to a reuters tally, with deaths doubling to more than 360.

“we’ve got to lasso this virus, this stallion, bring the numbers back down and get control of this thing,” hidalgo county judge richard cortez said. “because our hospitals – they’re war zones, they are really struggling right now.”

cortez, a democrat who serves as the top county official, issued a shelter-in-place order for residents. that mandate put him at odds with republican governor greg abbott, who maintains that local officials do not have the authority to make residents stay home.crematoriums in the hidalgo area have a wait list of two weeks, cortez said, forcing the county to use five refrigerated trucks that can hold 50 bodies each.

hidalgo’s top medical official, dr. ivan melendez, partly blamed abbott’s move to override local officials for the spike in coronavirus infections, which he said has jammed the local medical system at every level.

“do i think that a stay-at-home order is medically indicated at this point? absolutely,” melendez said.

on tuesday, u.s. deaths from covid-19 topped 1,000 in a single day for the first time since june 10. more than 142,000 people have died in the country during the past five months and deaths are rising in 23 states, according to the reuters tally.

the country’s three most populous states, florida, texas and california, top the list of 44 states where cases are increasing, based on a reuters analysis.

school disputes

california on wednesday reported more than 12,800 new infections, a one-day record. the state has now eclipsed new york for the highest number of cases overall, although new york has seen far more deaths at 32,000 versus 7,800 in california.

the surge has fueled disputes over mandatory mask orders and how best to resume schooling.

in chicago, dozens of teachers staged a socially distant motor protest against mayor lori lightfoot’s plan for chicago public schools to start the academic year with a mix of in-person instruction and remote learning.

“if the biggies make the decisions that teachers are going back fully in class, then somebody is going to die. if it isn’t a student, it’ll be a teacher, a teacher’s grandmother or a student’s grandmother,” said retired teacher jerome jordan, 78.

the protesting teachers said officials have not unveiled a detailed plan to clean schools adequately, provide disinfectant and personal protective equipment and instruct them how to implement social distancing in large groups of children.

in georgia, a third judge has been appointed in the dispute between republican governor brian kemp and atlanta’s keisha lance bottoms, a democrat and mayor of the state’s largest city, over whether people must wear masks.

among the few states seeing a drop in infections was arizona, another recent hotspot which saw new infections fall 13 percent last week. hospitalizations in the state have steadily trended downward after peaking on july 13.

arizona governor doug ducey, a republican, was encouraged by those trends, his office said in a written statement, but cautioned that it was not time for the public to let down its guard.

“we need to continue doing the things we know make a difference: wearing a mask, physically distancing and staying home as much as possible,” ducey’s office said in the statement."
"Judge rules media outlets have to turn over images, footage of May Seattle protest that turned violent",332,hx0e81,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/508839-judge-rules-media-outlets-have-to-turn-over-images-footage-of-may,110,1595620342.0,,"a king county, wash., judge on thursday ruled five news outlets must turn over unpublished photos and footage from a may 30 seattle protest for social and racial justice to the city's police department.

king county superior court judge nelson lee on thursday morning ruled the department’s subpoena was enforceable and that the materials were necessary for its investigation of alleged theft of seattle police department (spd) guns and burning of spd vehicles after the protest turned violent, according to the seattle times.

the seattle times was one of the outlets subpoenaed.

the suspects police are seeking allegedly damaged six vehicles, smashing windows and stealing equipment. the subpoena is seeking footage and photos from a 90-minute period in a four-block area.

lee ruled that while the outlets were not protected by the state shield law, which governs the circumstances in which authorities can seek unpublished materials from journalists, police could only use the materials to identify suspects in the alleged arsons and theft of the guns. they could not pursue other crimes if the materials contain evidence of other wrongdoing, according to the newspaper.

photos and videos on reporters’ personal cellphones are also exempt from the subpoena, which only applies to images on professional equipment.

in addition to the times, the department subpoenaed tv stations kiro7, king5, komo4 and kcpq13.

times executive editor michele matass flores argued the subpoena “puts our independence, and even our staff’s physical safety, at risk,” according to the newspaper.

“the media exist in large part to hold governments, including law enforcement agencies, accountable to the public,” she said. “we don’t work in concert with government, and it’s important to our credibility and effectiveness to retain our independence from those we cover.”

eric stahl, the attorney for the media outlets, argued that the police could not demonstrate they would be able to identify suspects from the materials they were seeking, and that “you have to have a strong reason to believe there is actually going to be critical evidence” in such images before subpoenaing them.

“we think there was too much speculation going on,” stahl said after the hearing, saying the outlets had not yet decided whether they would appeal the decision."

(kaya taitano/social media/via reuters)

nicholas sandmann, the covington catholic high school student who sued major news outlets in the aftermath of their coverage of a controversial interaction he and several of his classmates had with a native american activist, said friday that he has settled his libel lawsuit against the washington post.

“on 2/19/19, i filed $250m defamation lawsuit against washington post. today, i turned 18 & wapo settled my lawsuit,” sandmann wrote in a tweet friday morning, adding that he thanks his lawyers, his family, and “millions of you who have stood your ground by supporting me.”

“i still have more to do,” sandmann added.

sandmann sued the post and other major news outlets after their coverage portrayed sandmann and his classmates as racist and aggressive towards nathan phillips, an elderly native american man, during a confrontation near the lincoln memorial on january 18 of last year.

viral video of the incident showed sandmann, who was 16 at the time, and phillips standing face to face as phillips loudly beat on a drum inches away from the kentucky high schooler’s face while sandmann smirked. nbc asserted that sandmann “blocked” phillips and “did not allow him to retreat” during their interaction. longer versions of the video showed that phillips approached sandmann, who stood mostly still during the incident. before the encounter between sandmann and phillips members of the black hebrew israelites, a militant black nationalist group, began a confrontation with the teenagers, taunting and shouting slurs at them.

sandmann and his classmates wore “make america great again” caps and were attending the annual anti-abortion march for life, while phillips was participating in the indigenous peoples march.

also on friday, sandmann tweeted a veiled warning to twitter ceo jack dorsey.

“the fight isn’t over. 2 down. 6 to go. don’t hold your breath @jack,” sandmann wrote.

in january, cnn settled sandmann’s multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit against them for an undisclosed amount of money. the suit cited the “emotional distress nicholas and his family suffered” due to the network’s coverage of the encounter. sandmann also has ongoing lawsuits against abc, cbs, nbc, the new york times, gannett, rolling stone, and several other news outlets.

“it used to be in the old days before this, you’d write a letter and you’d say, ‘this letter is really bad,’ you put it on your desk and you go back tomorrow and you say, ‘oh, i’m glad i didn’t send it,’” trump told barstool sports’ founder dave portnoy.

“but we don’t do that with twitter. we put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you start getting phone calls, ‘did you really say this?’ i say, ‘what’s wrong with that?’ and you find a lot of things,” continued the president, who is often the subject of criticism over his use of his twitter account. “you know what i find? it’s not the tweets, it’s the retweets that get you in trouble.”

trump went on to say he doesn’t always look closely at the tweets that he shares from his twitter account, which has 84 million followers.

he had similarly said that some of his tweets create problems for the white house in an interview last year.

trump also told portnoy he believed twitter to be a powerful messaging tool, explaining that he uses it to cut against “fake news” — a phrase he often uses in deriding critical press coverage of his administration.

the president’s interview with barstool sports was taped thursday, marking opening day for the abbreviated 2020 major league baseball season, and was published online friday.

trump has a long track record of tweeting or retweeting controversial messages, including recently sharing a tweet of a video showing an apparent trump supporter yelling “white power” in response to protesters. trump later deleted the tweet, and the white house said the president had not heard the racist phrase when he shared it.

he also came under fire for a tweet he sent in late may criticizing protesters in minneapolis and warning that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” — repeating a phrase that was used by a miami police chief cracking down on protests during the civil rights era. trump later denied knowing the racially charged history of the phrase.

in june, twitter said it labeled a trump tweet with an official advisory “for violating our policy against abusive behavior, specifically, the presence of a threat of harm against an identifiable group.”

and earlier this month, trump retweeted a game show host who alleged that the centers for disease control and prevention and others were lying about the novel coronavirus in order to hurt his reelection chances."

artyom mozgov, 20, is among the thousands of people who have been protesting for two weeks in the russian city of khabarovsk, seven time zones east of moscow on the chinese border.

""people go out every day without any kind of organization,"" mozgov, a political activist, told npr. ""i'm really happy that people from my region have finally taken responsibility for their lives, understand what's happening in our country and go out and protest.""

since july 11, he and other residents have been demanding the release of the former regional governor, sergei furgal, who was arrested two days earlier by masked federal agents on charges of organizing contract killings 15 years ago. furgal, now in pretrial detention in a moscow prison, maintains his innocence, and locals are demanding he be released and face the charges in his hometown.

the size and durability of the demonstrations are unprecedented for khabarovsk, a provincial capital with a population of 600,000. for president vladimir putin, whose aversion to street protests is well known, they pose an additional challenge as russia battles the coronavirus pandemic and the economic downturn it caused.

on monday, putin officially fired furgal and appointed mikhail degtyaryov, a little-known national legislator from the city of samara, as acting governor.

""i wish you good luck, i'll see you later,"" putin told degtyaryov in a videoconference before the new governor got on a plane to make the almost eight-hour flight from moscow to khabarovsk.

on his first night in town, protesters chanted, ""degtyaryov, go away!"" he responded defiantly, streaming his walk to work the next morning on instagram.

""i won't leave because there's a lot of work to do,"" he said. ""the region has been without a leader for 10 days, and there's a stack of papers on my desk a meter high.""

the new governor's main task will be to quell the protests rocking the region.

""i'm afraid degtyaryov is not up to the job,"" said nikolai petrov, an expert on russia's regions at the chatham house think tank in london. ""for one, he came from far away, and secondly, he doesn't have any real leadership experience.""

degtyaryov is from the same political party as the deposed governor, but putin is mistaken in assuming that will help his appointee defuse the khabarovsk protests, petrov said.

both degtyaryov and furgal are members of the liberal democratic party of russia, which belongs to the so-called systemic opposition — a handful of parties the kremlin uses as sparring partners for the ruling united russia party. nationalist firebrand vladimir zhirinovsky, who has spoken out in furgal's defense, has led the party since the collapse of the soviet union nearly three decades ago.

degtyaryov's party affiliation is irrelevant to most protesters in khabarovsk, who view him as someone imposed from moscow, petrov said. furgal, on the other hand, is a popular local figure who trounced the kremlin-backed incumbent governor in a landslide election two years ago.

in many regions of russia, the liberal democratic party of russia — much like the communist party — has drawn voters not thanks to any particular ideology but as a safe way to voice protest. last year, the party took an absolute majority of the khabarovsk regional assembly, with united russia hanging onto just two seats. united russia was swept out of khabarovsk's city council, with the liberal democratic party of russia taking 34 of 35 seats.

""putin personally — and putin's stooges who run the far east — hate khabarovsk region and its inhabitants because time and again, they lose elections there,"" opposition leader alexei navalny said in a video posted thursday that was widely shared on social media.

the last straw for the kremlin was a recent vote on constitutional amendments allowing putin to stay in power until 2036, because furgal didn't deliver the expected results, navalny said. turnout in the khabarovsk region was 44%, among the lowest in the country, with 62% voting in favor of the amendments. nationwide, turnout was 68%, with 78% for the changes.

now the kremlin is intent on restoring the primacy of united russia and deterring other provinces from going the way of khabarovsk, navalny said.

the kremlin's approach is not without risk, petrov warned.

""the people in khabarovsk are showing that it's possible to protest and that the kremlin can't do anything to them if there are 30,000 or 40,000 of them,"" he said. ""the longer the protests continue, the more negative a role they play for the kremlin.""

the khabarovsk protest may inspire other regions to vote against kremlin-backed candidates in september elections. people living in the far-flung reaches of siberia and russia's far east are less susceptible to pressure from the kremlin, petrov said.

the kremlin now confronts the dilemma of using force or making concessions that will be closely watched by other regions, he said. a wave of protests in moscow last summer was followed by arrests and criminal cases against participants.

two opposition activists in khabarovsk, dmitry nizovtsev and sergei naumov, said they were attacked and beaten by unidentified assailants in two separate incidents since thursday.

mozgov said police have summoned him to appear next week on suspicion of violating a law on public rallies.

the protests have become more radical, first opposing meddling by moscow, then voicing support for the arrested former governor and now calling for putin's resignation, he said.

on saturday, demonstrations in khabarovsk will enter their third week.

""i think even more people will come out than on the past two weekends,"" mozgov said. ""we, the residents of khabarovsk, hope our acting governor, degtyaryov, will come out to talk with us. everything depends on that.""

putin's governor, though, has already said he has better things to do than meet with ""those who shout below my window."" degtyaryov announced on instagram that he will be traveling this weekend to a remote, unspecified part of the khabarovsk region."
Local TV stations across US to air conspiracy theory on Fauci,356,hxq0u6,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/25/sinclair-tv-stations-fauci-plandemic-conspiracy-theory,37,1595725122.0,,"sinclair television said on saturday it would delay airing an interview with a conspiracy theorist who claims baselessly that dr anthony fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, created the coronavirus behind the current pandemic.

dr judy mikovits, a former research scientist, is behind the widely discredited plandemic video, which makes a string of false and outlandish claims including that any coronavirus vaccine will kill millions and that beaches should not be closed because the sand and ocean will somehow treat covid-19.

fauci is the 79-year-old director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. he has served six presidents, but donald trump has sought to keep him off television, called him “alarmist” and frequently undermined his work.

the us is in the grip of a worsening coronavirus outbreak in which more than 4.1m cases have been recorded and more than 145,000 people have died.

mikovits’ lawyer, larry klayman, was also interviewed on sinclair’s america this week with the former fox news host eric bolling. footage was posted online.

according to the southern poverty law center, which monitors far-right groups in the us, klayman, the founder of the judicial watch, is “a pathologically litigious attorney and professional gadfly notorious for suing everyone from iran’s supreme leader to his own mother”.

on bolling’s show, klayman and mikovits said they planned to sue fauci because, mikovits claimed, in the last decade the doctor “manufactured” and shipped coronaviruses to wuhan, china, the origin of the pandemic.

before sinclair announced its delay, bolling told cnn he did not “know of any video [mikovits] was in prior to or after appearing on my show” and said: “frankly, i was shocked when she made the accusation.”

the host also said he had questioned mikovits’ claim, which onscreen he called “hefty”, and had added dr nicole saphier, a fox news contributor, to the show in order to provide balance.

“i asked our producers to add saphier to the show for the express purpose of debunking the conspiracy theory,” bolling said. “i believe viewers see that i did not and do not endorse [mikovits’] theory.”

saphier said it was “highly unlikely” fauci made the coronavirus. but she also said it was possible the virus was made in a laboratory.

leading trump allies have pushed that claim as the administration seeks to blame china for the pandemic. experts say the disease originated in a wet market, where live wild animals are sold for food.

speaking to the guardian in may, professor eric oliver, a university of chicago political scientist and author of enchanted america: how intuition and reason divide our politics, said medical conspiracy theories were the most widely circulated and believed.

“this sort of contagious disease that’s invisible makes people extremely apprehensive,” he said, adding that the coronavirus pandemic is “a profoundly displacing event and the uncertainty and anxiety it has generated in health, the economy and politics are just really deep.

“some people are primed to seek out some sort of simple answer to very complex political and health issues and into that void conspiracy theories rush right in.”

sinclair offers a considerable platform, through tv stations across the us.

the company’s links to the trump administration have come under scrutiny, for example when in 2018 local news anchors were instructed to read an identical script criticising “fake” news stories.

its chairman, david d smith, has said that in 2016 he told trump: “we are here to deliver your message.”

in a statement on saturday, the company said: “we are incredibly aware of the dangers of covid-19 and our stations across 81 markets have remained steadfast in covering their communities with a focus on safety and adherence to local protocols and regulations nationwide.

“after further review, we have decided to delay this episode’s airing. we will spend the coming days bringing together other viewpoints and provide additional context. all stations have been notified not to air this and will instead be re-airing last week’s episode in its place.”"
North Korea declares state of emergency as Covid-19 case reported,237,hxypm9,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/kim-jong-un-conveys-urgent-meeting-after-suspected-case-of-covid-19,20,1595757855.0,,"north korea has declared an emergency and a lockdown in a border town after a person suspected of having coronavirus returned from south korea after illegally crossing the border, state media has said.

if confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by north korean authorities.

kim jong-un convened an emergency politburo meeting in response to what he called a “critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”, the north’s kcna state news reported.

a person who defected to south korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two koreas to the town of kaesong this month with symptoms of covid-19, according to kcna.

“an emergency event happened in kaesong city where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus, returned on 19 july after illegally crossing the demarcation line,” kcna said.

the agency did not say if the person had been tested, but said an “uncertain result was made from several medical checkups of the secretion of that person’s upper respiratory organ and blood”, prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.

one analyst said the announcement was important, not only because north korea was for the first time reporting a suspected coronavirus case but also because it suggested it was appealing for help.

“it’s an ice-breaking moment for north korea to admit a case,” said choo jae-woo, a professor at kyung hee university in seoul. “it could be reaching out to the world for help. perhaps for humanitarian assistance.”

north korea is under economic pressure because of international sanctions over its nuclear programme. cho han-bum, a senior fellow at the korea institute for national unification in seoul, said it was significant that north korea was reporting that its first suspected coronavirus case was imported.

“north korea is in such a dire situation, where they can’t even finish building the pyongyang general hospital on time. pointing the blame at an ‘imported case’ from south korea, the north can use this as a way to openly accept aid from the south,” cho said.

kcna did not elaborate on how the unidentified “runaway” had crossed one of the world’s most heavily guarded borders but said the incident was being investigated and the military unit responsible would face “severe punishment”.

the south’s joint chiefs of staff (jcs) said there was a “high chance” that someone had indeed crossed and the military was checking surveillance footage. it suggested it might be able to identify the person.

“our military has specified some people and is verifying facts in close collaboration with related agencies,” the jcs said.

north korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from russia and other countries and imposed strict border closures. thousands of people were quarantined as it took precautions to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, but restrictions had recently been eased."
Putin says Russian Navy to get hypersonic nuclear strike weapons,155,hy64fx,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-navy-day-parade-putin/putin-says-russian-navy-to-get-hypersonic-nuclear-strike-weapons-idUSKCN24R0CJ,12,1595795401.0,,"moscow (reuters) - russian president vladimir putin said on sunday the russian navy would be armed with hypersonic nuclear strike weapons and underwater nuclear drones, which the defence ministry said were in their final phase of testing.

putin, who says he does not want an arms race, has often spoken of a new generation of russian nuclear weapons that he says are unequalled and can hit almost anywhere in the world. some western experts have questioned how advanced they are.

the weapons, some of which have yet to be deployed, include the poseidon underwater nuclear drone, designed to be carried by submarines, and the tsirkon (zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, which can be deployed on surface ships.

the combination of speed, manoeuvrability and altitude of hypersonic missiles, capable of travelling at more than five times the speed of sound, makes them difficult to track and intercept.

speaking in st petersburg at an annual naval parade that showcases russia’s best ships, nuclear submarines and naval aviation, putin said the navy’s capabilities were growing and it would get 40 new vessels this year.

he did not specify when it would receive new hypersonic weapons, but suggested that day was drawing closer.

“the widespread deployment of advanced digital technologies that have no equals in the world, including hypersonic strike systems and underwater drones, will give the fleet unique advantages and increased combat capabilities,” putin said.

in a separate statement released via russian news agencies, the defence ministry said testing of the belgorod, the first submarine capable of carrying the poseidon drones, was underway and testing of the weapons systems was nearing completion.

“work is being successfully completed to create modern weapons systems for the navy,” it was cited as saying.

putin last year threatened to deploy hypersonic missiles on ships and submarines that could lurk outside u.s. territorial waters if the united states moved to deploy intermediate-range nuclear weapons in europe.

washington has not deployed such missiles in europe, but moscow is worried it might."
Ramirez goes deep twice as Indians beat Royals,3,hyf828,https://www.reuters.com/article/baseball-mlb-cle-kc/ramirez-goes-deep-twice-as-indians-beat-royals-idUSMTZXEG7Q3FX87I,6,1595827804.0,,"jose ramirez hit two homers and drove in four runs on sunday afternoon, powering the cleveland indians to a 9-2 victory over the kansas city royals and a series win over their american league central rival.

slideshow ( 24 images )

after being held to a total of four runs while splitting a pair of season-opening games, the indians came alive offensively with 13 hits in the series finale, including three apiece by ramirez and domingo santana, and two by cesar hernandez.

right-hander carlos carrasco (1-0) benefitted from the big-time support, coasting through six innings with 10 strikeouts. he allowed both royals runs on five hits and one walk.

it was carrasco’s first start since being diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia last june. he returned in september and took on a role in the bullpen, but this season he has reclaimed his longtime job in the starting rotation.

ramirez, one of five indians with 20 or more homers last season with 23, smacked the club’s first of the season, a three-run shot off royals reliever kevin mccarthy, in the fourth inning, increasing cleveland’s lead to 7-1.

the two-time all-star added a solo shot off richard lovelady in the sixth, giving him multiple homers in a game for the 13th time in his career. he also belted a pair against the royals last season on july 4.

ramirez finished 3-for-5 and scored four times.

cleveland wasted no time jumping on royals right-hander ronald bolanos (0-1), taking advantage of a throwing error by third baseman erick mejia to grab a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first. franmil reyes and santana had two-out, rbi singles in the inning. both runs were unearned.

the 23-year-old bolanos, making his royals debut after having been acquired in july from san diego, was pulled after two innings, having allowed three hits and the two unearned runs. he walked one and struck out one.

the indians added another pair of runs in the third. hernandez, who had opened the inning with a single, made it 3-0 when he raced home from first on ramirez’s single and subsequent throwing error by royals right fielder franchy cordero. francisco lindor followed by doubling home ramirez.

a sacrifice fly by bradley zimmer in the seventh completed the cleveland scoring.

salvador perez and whit merrifield drove in runs for the royals, who were coming off a 3-2, 10-inning win over the indians on saturday.

adalberto mondesi and maikel franco had two hits apiece for kansas city.

"'It’s my constitutional freaking right': Black Americans arm themselves in response to pandemic, protests",392,hyg7f6,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/26/black-americans-gun-owners-380162,88,1595831242.0,[deleted],"while the vast majority of demonstrators across the u.s. this summer have been unarmed, some have sought to make a statement with their guns. in stone mountain, ga., an open carry state, at least 150 african americans asserted their second amendment right as a tool of protest. dressed in black and armed with semi-automatic rifles, the group marched through stone mountain park to protest its depiction of confederate generals.

a similar march organized by black gun owners took place in oklahoma city in june, timed to president donald trump’s rally in nearby tulsa. smith said his organization is not affiliated with such groups but empathizes with their members.

“any time any community has been pushed and pushed like ours has been pushed, i may not agree with what you do as another organization, but i certainly understand where that stems from,” he said, adding that the groups' efforts were done out of “survival and being able to protect your community.”

their demonstration and others have drawn the ire of some conservatives. georgia sen. kelly loeffler decried the “mob rule” in atlanta during a june 24 interview on fox news , as the cable network played images of black protesters carrying semi-automatic weapons. “we’re a nation of the rule of law and this is exactly what will happen if we defund the police,” loeffler warned.

her rhetoric echoes that of the white house and other republicans in washington, who have taken an increasingly antagonistic tone towards protesters and members of the black lives matter movement over the past month.

trump has referred to the movement as a ""hate group"" and repeated talking points in favor of tough policing. the president and his supporters, meanwhile, defended a white st. louis couple captured on video pointing guns at black protesters marching by. according to fox news, the couple told police they retrieved their firearms after spotting armed protesters.

other members of his circle have taken to calling black lives matter protesters ""marxists"" who have been ""planning to destroy the police for years.""

attempts to fan fears of armed, militant black americans is not a new political tactic. in 1969, fbi director j. edgar hoover described the black panther party , which advocated for african americans to take up guns as a form of self-defense, as ""the greatest threat to internal security of the country."" concerns about the group in the late 1960s even prompted the national rifle association, no fan of gun restrictions, to partner with california gov. ronald reagan to pass gun control legislation that limited open carry at the state capitol."
Why Florida Could Go Blue In 2020,42,hyscrn,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-florida-could-go-blue-in-2020/,9,1595885656.0,,"this is the second in a series of articles examining the politics and demographics of 2020’s expected swing states.

electorally, florida bounces around like a beach ball. in 2008 and 2012, as americans nationwide backed barack obama for president, florida voted democratic too. but in 2016, when donald trump reclaimed the white house for the republicans, florida switched its allegiance to the gop. indeed, the sunshine state has voted for the national winner in each of the past six presidential elections.

but in 2018, florida stopped following national trends. in a great year for democrats nationwide, which saw them net 40 house seats and seven governorships, the “blue wave” stopped at florida’s sandy beaches. although the national political environment leaned almost 9 percentage points in democrats’ favor, republican rick scott defeated incumbent democratic sen. bill nelson by 0.1 points, and republican ron desantis defeated democrat andrew gillum by 0.4 points in the open-seat race for governor. the results prompted some pundits to relabel florida a “red state” going into the pivotal 2020 election.

[related: how arizona became a swing state]

they’re right, to a degree: florida has long been a slightly red state. since 2004, it has consistently voted 3 or 4 points more republican than the nation as a whole in presidential elections. (indeed, polls of florida are currently 0.9 points better for president trump than national polls, according to fivethirtyeight’s polling averages.) but could what happened in 2018 — when florida was so much redder than the nation that it was out of reach for democrats, even in a wave election — happen again in 2020?

it’s true that, on the surface, nelson and gillum barely improved upon hillary clinton’s 1.2-point loss in florida in 2016. accounting for the much bluer national environment, that would imply either that florida is immune to shifts in the national mood or that the state lurched to the right sometime in the intervening two years. but as the map below shows, nelson actually performed from 3 to 14 points better than clinton in a majority of florida counties, even though he lost many of her voters elsewhere in the state. (gillum’s map told a similar story, so we’re not showing it, as of the two 2018 democratic candidates, nelson — a moderate white man in his 70s — is a better stand-in for the party’s presumptive 2020 presidential nominee, joe biden.) this is important because it underscores that the state is not “wave-proof”; instead, it’s made up of some complex coalitions that we’ll dive into more momentarily.

ultimately, scott (and desantis) won because they did significantly better than trump in a handful of big counties, virtually erasing democratic gains elsewhere. most glaringly, miami-dade county — florida’s most populated county — and osceola county voted more than 8 points more republican in the 2018 senate race than in the 2016 presidential race. in addition, nelson underperformed clinton by 6 points in the much less populous hendry county.

what’s so special about these counties? they are florida’s three majority-hispanic counties, and it turns out that hispanic voters voted significantly less democratic in 2018 than in 2016. according to exit polls, hispanic voters voted for nelson 54 percent to 45 percent (the gubernatorial numbers were virtually identical), two years after they supported clinton 62 percent to 35 percent. so the big question for democrats in 2020 is whether biden can return to clinton’s level of support among hispanics.

[related: how popular is president donald trump?]

it’s hard to say for sure, as the reasons for democrats’ 2018 underperformance in florida are as diverse as the state’s hispanic population. for example, puerto rican floridians (who make up 32 percent of osceola county) strongly dislike trump, but they actually gave scott high marks for focusing on their community in the wake of hurricane maria. but with trump back on the ballot in 2020, there’s good reason to think that their republican sympathies will evaporate once again. according to carlos odio, the co-founder of data firm equislabs, a private poll recently gave biden a 41-point lead among puerto rican voters in florida, which would be close to the 46-point lead clinton enjoyed in a latino decisions poll immediately before the 2016 election.

democrats may not be able to solve their problems so easily with cuban americans, though, who make up the plurality (36 percent) of crucial miami-dade county. cuban americans are the rare bloc of hispanic voters who truly lean republican; in fact, they outright backed trump in 2016. trump is estimated to have won between 50 percent and 58 percent of florida’s cuban american vote in 2016, and this group has been even more republican in past presidential elections. they still vote strongly republican in elections for lower offices as well. for instance, the florida international university cuba poll, which has measured public opinion among cuban americans for almost 30 years, found that scott and desantis each won about 70 percent of the cuban american vote in miami-dade. this was likely instrumental in miami-dade’s rightward shift in 2018: an analysis of the 2016 and 2018 results by democratic data consultant matthew isbell found that the miami-dade precincts that swung hardest toward the gop were its most cuban american precincts.

[related: the latest political polls collected by fivethirtyeight]

and unfortunately for biden, trump’s crusades against socialism and hardline stance against cuba and its close ally venezuela may have elevated his standing among cuban americans. an equislabs poll from november 2019 found that 63 percent of cuban american voters in florida would vote to reelect trump (though, of course, that was long before the pandemic started dragging down his polling numbers across the board). that wouldn’t be as bad for democrats as 2018, but equislabs estimates that level of support would be worth a net of 90,000 more trump votes in florida than in 2016.

however, even if trump makes inroads with cuban americans, some historical trends suggest that miami-dade will not be as red as it was in 2018. for reasons ranging from disproportionately low democratic turnout in midterms to the cuban american habit of voting more republican in nonpresidential races, the margin in miami-dade is almost always less democratic in midterm years than in the presidential years on either side. so miami-dade’s right turn in 2018 was actually completely predictable — and it might not mean anything for 2020.

the real question mark is whether miami-dade will follow the pattern of recent years in 2020 and be bluer than it was in 2016. for reasons ranging from generational change (cuban americans born in the u.s. are more likely than their immigrant parents and grandparents to vote democratic) to the ubiquitous urban and suburban realignment, the county has voted more democratic in every successive presidential election since 2004.

of course, there’s always the possibility that this trend won’t continue.

one final point in biden’s favor is florida’s large population of older americans. of all the states in the union, florida has the largest proportion of residents age 65 or older (20 percent) — and polls indicate that biden is winning among these voters nationally. that’s unusual for a democrat these days, too, which speaks to biden’s current electoral strength. there is evidence that biden isn’t doing quite as well among older floridians (trump was leading among them by 8 points in both a recent cbs news/yougov poll and the latest new york times upshot/siena college poll), but the former vice president is still doing better than either clinton (who lost among voters age 65 or older by 17 points) or nelson (who lost among them by 14) did, according to the exit polls.

if this trend holds, it has the potential to help biden all across the state, but especially in counties with lots of retirement communities. two of these counties are where democrats also lost ground in the 2018 senate race: collier (which was 4 points redder in 2018 than in 2016) and sumter (which was 3 points redder). collier, on the southwest coast, is home to naples and is 31 percent age 65 or older. and sumter, the location of famously massive retirement community the villages, is a whopping 56 percent age 65 or older. unlike miami-dade and osceola, these counties might really be drifting toward republicans in the long term, but biden may have what it takes to temporarily reverse that trend.

[related: our 2020 national polling averages]

in summary, it’s not unreasonable to believe that biden will be able to hold onto (or build upon) nelson’s gains in the blue counties in the map above, thanks to the current pro-democratic national environment. and with the help of hispanic voters, older voters, or both, it’s also not hard to imagine biden returning to clinton’s levels of support in some of the counties that drifted red in 2018. however, trump is fighting to build upon his 2016 support among these voters too, and without them, biden will have a hard time winning the state — as 2018 showed.

the bottom line: the outlook is bright for democrats in the sunshine state. on average, polls of florida show biden leading trump by a healthy 7.1 points. if that holds, it would be a blowout by florida standards — the widest margin for a presidential candidate since george h.w. bush won by 22 points in 1988. but, of course, if florida does go blue again in 2020, it would put the state in a very familiar role: as a beach ball once again.

National security adviser Robert O'Brien tests positive for Covid-19,109,hyta9l,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/27/national-security-adviser-robert-obrien-tests-positive-for-covid-19-382347,7,1595888972.0,,"the line recalled similar language trump has used in the past when expressing displeasure at senior officials, though there's no indication that o'brien's job is on the line or that trump is mad at him.

but the president's remarks come days after a thursday phone call between trump and russian president vladimir putin -- the kind of high-level meeting that would typically demand the national security adviser's close involvement. the white house released a spartan readout of the call that did not list the participants, and administration officials declined to answer questions about whether o'brien was in the oval office at the time.

according to a white house statement, o’brien “has mild symptoms and has been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site. there is no risk of exposure to the president or the vice president. the work of the national security council continues uninterrupted.”

the news of o'brien's diagnosis caught some nsc staffers by surprise -- one nsc official said he heard about it from the press this morning. another white house official said it was business as usual at the white house on monday, with no temperature checks to enter the white house grounds as there used to be earlier in the pandemic.

trump economic adviser larry kudlow told reporters on monday morning that o’brien got infected from his daughter, and it's unclear how much in-person contact he’s had recently with trump. anyone who is near the president is tested regularly for the disease.

o’brien, 54, and his deputy matt pottinger were early internal advocates of swift action to combat the outbreak. more recently, he has focused on coordinating the administration’s pushback against a rising china — he went to paris earlier this month to meet with several european counterparts about china and other foreign policy issues, bringing along several conservative journalists. in late june, he traveled to arizona to deliver a speech comparing chinese leader xi jinping to josef stalin.

according to bloomberg news, which first reported o’brien’s positive test, he “contracted the virus while taking a few days off from work, spending time with his family” and is currently working from home. a white house official said o’brien was visiting family late last week, and nsc staffers who interacted with o’brien are getting tested, although it’s unknown how many. an nsc spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
Anti-fascists linked to zero murders in the US in 25 years | US news,58,hyubiw,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/27/us-rightwing-extremists-attacks-deaths-database-leftwing-antifa,59,1595892364.0,,"as trump rails against ‘far-left’ fascism, new database shows leftwing attacks have left far fewer people dead than violence by rightwing extremists

donald trump has made warnings about the threat of antifa and “far-left fascism” a central part of his re-election campaign. but in reality leftwing attacks have left far fewer people dead than violence by rightwing extremists, new research indicates, and antifa activists have not been linked to a single murder in decades.

a new database of nearly 900 politically motivated attacks and plots in the united states since 1994 includes just one attack staged by an anti-fascist that led to fatalities. in that case, the single person killed was the perpetrator.

white supremacists or anti-police libertarians? what we know about the 'boogaloo' read more

over the same time period, american white supremacists and other rightwing extremists have carried out attacks that left at least 329 victims dead, according to the database.

more broadly, the database lists 21 victims killed in leftwing attacks since 2010 , and 117 victims of rightwing attacks in that same period – nearly six times as much. attacks inspired by the islamic state and similar jihadist groups, in contrast, killed 95 people since 2010, slightly fewer than rightwing extremists, according to the data set. more than half of these victims died in a a single attack on a gay nightclub in orlando, florida, in 2016.

‘leftwing violence has not been a major terrorism threat’

the database was assembled by researchers at the center for strategic and international studies (csis), a centrist thinktank, and reviewed by the guardian.

its launch comes as trump administration officials have echoed the president’s warnings of a violent “leftwing” revolution. “groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate, violent and extremist agenda,” the attorney general, william barr, said amid nationwide protests following the death of george floyd. a new justice department taskforce on violent anti-government extremists listed “antifa” as a major threat, while making no mention of white supremacy.

defining which violent incidents constitute politically motivated acts of terrorism, and trying to sort political violence into leftwing and rightwing categories, is inherently messy and debatable work. this is particularly true in the us, where highly publicized mass shootings are common, and some have no clear political motivation at all.

stated political motives for violent attacks often overlap with other potential factors, including life crises, anger issues, a history of violent behavior and, in some cases, serious mental health conditions.

while researchers sometimes disagree on how to categorize the ideology of specific attacks, multiple databases that track extremist violence, including data maintained by the anti-defamation league, and from journalists at the center for investigative reporting, have found the same trend: it’s violent rightwing attacks, not “far-left” violence, that presents the greater deadly threat to americans today.

“leftwing violence has not been a major terrorism threat,” said seth jones, a counter-terrorism expert who led the creation of csis’s dataset. .

categorizing ‘leftwing’ extremist attacks

most of the deadly extremist attacks the csis researchers categorized as “leftwing” were killings of police officers by black men, many of them us military veterans, who described acting out of anger or retribution for police killings of black americans.

these shooting attacks include the murder of two police officers in new york city in 2014, after michael brown and eric garner’s killings; and the murders of five officers in dallas, texas, and three officers in baton rouge, louisiana, in 2016.

some of the gunmen who killed police had connections to black nationalist groups, which extremism researchers at csis and elsewhere said they typically categorize as leftwing, largely because in the 1960s, influential black nationalist groups like the black panther party were anti-capitalist and considered part of the new left.

making that categorization is less straightforward today, some researchers acknowledge, since some prominent black nationalist organizations express homophobic, misogynistic and antisemitic views, values that set them in opposition to the current american left.

mark pitcavage, a senior fellow at the adl’s center on extremism, noted that gavin eugene long, who staged an attack on police in baton rouge, had ties to black nationalism and was also part of an offshoot of the sovereign citizens movement, an anti-government ideology that is typically categorized as rightwing.

in several of the high-profile leftwing attacks included in the csis list the only fatality was the perpetrator. a mass shooting attack on a group of congressional republicans during a baseball practice outside of washington dc, in 2017 left the republican congressman steve scalise seriously injured, and three other people shot.

the gunman, james hodgkinson, 66, was the only one killed in the attack. hodgkinson had deliberately targeted republicans and had expressed disgust with trump.

many of the other leftwing attacks or plots in the csis database, including by anarchists, environmental groups and others, resulted in no deaths at all. often, leftwing plots, particularly by animal rights activists, have targeted businesses or buildings, “and their primary weapons have been incendiaries designed to create fires or destroy infrastructure – not kill people,” said jones, the researcher who led the creation of the data set.

the one deadly anti-fascist attack listed in the database occurred in july 2019, when willem von spronsen, a 69-year-old white man, was shot dead by police outside an ice detention center in tacoma, washington. authorities said von spronsen had been throwing molotov cocktails, setting flares, that he set a car on fire and that he had a rifle. local activists told media outlets they believed he had been trying to destroy buses parked outside the facility that were used to transport people who were being deported.

von spronsen, who had previously been arrested at a protest outside the detention center, was involved in a contentious divorce, and both a friend and his ex-wife had described him as suicidal. in a letter he wrote to friends before his death, von spronsen called detention centers “concentration camps” and said he wanted to take action against evil, buzzfeed news reported. “i am antifa,” he reportedly wrote.

no one was harmed in the attack except von spronsen, according to media reports.

researchers who monitor extremist groups at the anti-defamation league and the global project against hate and extremism said they, too, were not aware of a single murder linked to an american anti-fascist in the last 20 to 25 years.

heidi beirich, a co-founder of the global project against hate and extremism, said some leftwing groups were known for more radical and violent tactics in the 1960s, adding: “it’s just not the case today.”

mark pitcavage said he knew of only one killing, 27 years ago, that might potentially be classified as connected to anti-fascist activism: the shooting of a racist skinhead, eric banks, by an anti-racist skinhead, john bair, in portland, oregon, in 1993.

‘a false equivalence’

given the discrepancies between the deadly toll of leftwing and rightwing violence, american law enforcement agencies have long faced criticism for failing to take the threat of white supremacist violence seriously, while at the same time overstating the risks posed by leftwing protesters. after a violent rally in california in 2016, law enforcement officers worked with neo-nazis to build criminal cases against anti-fascist protesters, while not recommending charges against neo-nazis for stabbing the anti-fascists.

antifa activists have been the targets of domestic terror attacks by white supremacists, including in a terror plot early this year, in which law enforcement officials alleged that members of the neo-nazi group the base had planned to murder a married couple in georgia they believed were anti-fascist organizers.

“antifa is not going around murdering people like rightwing extremists are. it’s a false equivalence,” said beirich.

“i’ve at times been critical of antifa for getting into fights with nazis at rallies and that kind of violence, but i can’t think of one case in which an antifa person was accused of murder,” she added.

the new csis database only includes attacks through early may 2020, and does not yet list incidents connected with the massive national protests against police violence after minneapolis police killed george floyd, including the killings of two california law enforcement officers by a man authorities say was linked to the rightwing “boogaloo” movement.

today, jones said, “the most significant domestic terrorism threat comes from white supremacists, anti-government militias and a handful of individuals associated with the ‘boogaloo’ movement that are attempting to create a civil war in the united states.”

daily interpersonal violence and state violence pose a much greater threat to americans than any kind of extremist terror attack. more than 100,000 people have been killed in gun homicides in the united states in the past decade, according to estimates from the centers for disease control and prevention. us police officers shoot nearly 1,000 americans to death each year. black americans are more than twice as likely to be shot by the police as white americans, according to analysis by the washington post and the guardian.

but the president’s rhetoric about “antifa” violence has dangerous consequences, not just for anti-fascists, but for any americans who decide to protest, some activists said.

yvette felarca, a california-based organizer and anti-fascist activist, said she saw trump’s claims about antifa violence, particularly during the george floyd protests, as a message to his “hardcore” supporters that it was appropriate to attack people who came out to protest.

“it’s his way of saying to his supporters: ‘yeah, go after them. beat them or kill them to the point where they go back home and stay home afraid,’” felarca said."
Experimental COVID-19 vaccine is put to its biggest test,15,hyxdk8,https://apnews.com/33c57aa5d44d5cec2842964345fa16b1,6,1595901823.0,,"nurse carolyn grausgruber gives volunteer ithaca firefighter wade bardo, of erin, n.y., an injection as the world's biggest study of a possible covid-19 vaccine, developed by the national institutes of health and moderna inc., gets underway monday, july 27, 2020, in binghamton, n.y.

(ap photo/hans pennink)

the biggest test yet of an experimental covid-19 vaccine got underway monday with the first of some 30,000 americans rolling up their sleeves to receive shots created by the u.s. government as part of the all-out global race to stop the pandemic.

the glimmer of hope came even as google, in one of the gloomiest assessments of the coronavirus’s staying power from a major employer, decreed that most of its 200,000 employees and contractors should work from home through next june — a decision that could influence other big companies.

final-stage testing of the vaccine, developed by the national institutes of health and moderna inc., began with volunteers at numerous sites around the u.s. given either a real dose or a dummy without being told which.

“i’m excited to be part of something like this. this is huge,” said melissa harting, a 36-year-old nurse who received an injection in binghamton, new york. especially with family members in front-line jobs that could expose them to the virus, she added, “doing our part to eradicate it is very important to me.”

another company, pfizer inc., announced late monday that it had started its own study of its vaccine candidate in the u.s. and elsewhere. that study also aimed to recruit 30,000 people.

it will be months before results trickle in, and there is no guarantee the vaccines will ultimately work against the scourge that has killed over 650,000 people around the world, including almost 150,000 in the u.s.

“we’ve been sitting on the sidelines passively attempting to wear our masks and social distance and not go out when it’s not necessary. this is the first step of becoming active against this,” said dr. frank eder of meridian clinical research, the company that runs the binghamton trial site. “there’s really no other way to get past this.”

as if to underline how high the stakes are, there were more setbacks in efforts to contain the coronavirus.

in washington, the trump administration disclosed that national security adviser robert o’brien has the virus — the highest-ranking u.s. official to test positive so far. the white house said he has mild symptoms and “has been self-isolating and working from a secure location off site.”

the move to restart the national pastime ran into trouble just five days into the long-delayed season: two major league baseball games scheduled for monday night were called off as the miami marlins coped with an outbreak — the marlins’ home opener against the baltimore orioles, and the new york yankees’ game in philadelphia, where the marlins used the clubhouse over the weekend.

as for relief from the economic damage done by the virus, republicans on capitol hill rolled out a $1 trillion package that includes another round of $1,200 direct payments but reduces the extra $600 a week in federal unemployment benefits that expire for millions of americans on friday. republicans proposed $200 a week, saying the generous bump discourages people from returning to work. democrats call the added benefits a lifeline for those who have lost their jobs.

treasury secretary steven mnuchin and white house chief of staff mark meadows worked through the weekend on the gop proposal and have agreed to negotiate with house speaker nancy pelosi and democratic senate leader chuck schumer. house democrats passed a $3 trillion relief package a couple of months ago.

in europe, rising infections in spain and other countries caused alarm only weeks after nations reopened their borders in hopes of reviving tourism . over the weekend, britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from spain, norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire iberian peninsula, and france urged its citizens not to visit spain’s catalonia region.

scientists set speed records getting vaccines into massive testing just months after the coronavirus emerged. but they stressed that the public shouldn’t fear that anyone is cutting corners .

“this is a significant milestone,” nih director francis collins said after the first test injection of moderna’s vaccine was given, at 6:45 a.m. in savannah, georgia. “yes, we’re going fast, but no, we are not going to compromise” on proving whether the vaccine is safe and effective.

“we are focusing on speed because every day matters,” added stephane bancel, ceo of massachusetts-based moderna.

after volunteers get two doses a month apart, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus is spreading unchecked.

the answer probably won’t come until november or december, cautioned dr. anthony fauci, nih’s infectious-diseases chief.

among many questions the study may answer: how much protection does just one dose offer compared with the two scientists think are needed? if it works, will it protect against severe disease or block infection entirely?

don’t expect a vaccine as strong as the measles vaccine, which prevents about 97% of measles infections, fauci said, adding he would be happy with a covid-19 vaccine that’s 60% effective.

several other vaccines made by china and by britain’s oxford university began smaller final-stage tests in brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. but the u.s. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country.

full coverage: virus outbreak

every month through the fall, the government-funded covid-19 prevention network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate, each with 30,000 volunteers.

the final u.s. study of the oxford shot is set to begin in august, followed by a candidate from johnson & johnson in september and one from novavax in october.

that’s a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science. in recent weeks, more than 150,000 americans filled out an online registry signaling interest, collins said. but many more are needed.

nih is working to make sure that the study isn’t just filled with healthy, younger volunteers but includes populations hit hardest by covid-19, including older adults, those in poor health and african-americans and latinos.

“we really are going to depend upon that sense of volunteerism for individuals from every different corner of society if we’re going to really find out how this vaccine, and its potential to end this terrible pandemic, is go to work in each of those groups,” collins said.

How Local Covid Deaths Are Affecting Vote Choice,155,hzevob,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/upshot/polling-trump-virus-election.html,56,1595972596.0,,"to understand whether these community-level experiences are affecting people’s views of the president and his party, we need local-level data on both covid-19 deaths and people’s views of mr. trump and his fellow republicans over time — as the death tolls change place to place. this is a challenge; a typical poll of 1,000 people cannot deliver sufficiently granular data. there are more than 3,000 counties in the country, and the death tolls are changing in each of them in different ways every week.

the democracy fund + u.c.l.a. nationscape project has been interviewing 6,250 people a week since july 2019. to date, there are more than 300,000 completed interviews spanning every state in the country and most counties. the survey is conducted online and is fielded by the market research firm lucid.

the data contain more cases in big places like los angeles county than in small ones, like grafton county, n.h., but there are enough people in counties with varying rates of covid-19 deaths over time to investigate whether a relationship exists.

for our analyses, people in the survey are assigned their county’s per-capita 60-day cumulative number of covid-19 deaths. the 60-day period is that just preceding the date each person was interviewed. in this way, we capture variation in county-level deaths within counties because people in the same county are interviewed on different days.

similarly, because people have been interviewed all over the country on the same dates, we also have captured variation across counties at the same moment. some counties had high covid-19 death rates in april, while others did not. as we moved into may and june, a different set of counties experienced rising rates. the goal is to figure out whether the differences in covid-19 deaths per capita in a county at a given point in time are affecting how people plan to vote in 2020 and how they rate the president. (we also try to account for possible confounding factors that might also be changing broadly at the same time: see more on the methodology at bottom.)

the analyses reveal clear patterns across multiple levels of geography (states and counties) and different offices (president, senate and house). local coronavirus fatalities are hurting republicans running for federal offices."

Police: 'Umbrella Man' was a white supremacist trying to incite George Floyd rioting,211,hzl8el,https://www.startribune.com/police-umbrella-man-was-a-white-supremacist-trying-to-incite-george-floyd-rioting/571932272/,16,1595993469.0,,"a masked man who was seen in a viral video smashing the windows of a south minneapolis auto parts store during the george floyd protests, earning him the moniker ""umbrella man,"" is suspected of ties with a white supremacist group and sought to incite racial tension, police said.

a minneapolis police arson investigator said the act of vandalism at the autozone on e. lake street helped spark a chain reaction that led to days of looting and rioting. the store was among dozens of buildings across the city that burned to the ground in the days that followed.

""this was the first fire that set off a string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and the rest of the city,"" sgt. erika christensen wrote in a search warrant affidavit filed in court this week. ""until the actions of the person your affiant has been calling 'umbrella man,' the protests had been relatively peaceful. the actions of this person created an atmosphere of hostility and tension. your affiant believes that this individual's sole aim was to incite violence.""

police identified ""umbrella man"" thanks to a tip that came via e-mail last week, christensen said.

the star tribune could not independently verify the police account, which has so far only surfaced in the search warrant, and isn't naming the man because so far he has not been charged with a crime. the man, who has a criminal history that includes convictions of domestic violence and assault, did not respond to messages seeking comment. spokespersons for the minneapolis police department and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, which is also involved in the investigation, declined to comment.

floyd's death under the knee of a since-fired police officer set off protests that spread around the world and stirred widespread reckoning over racial injustice. derek chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, and three of his former colleagues also at the scene, j. alexander kueng, thomas lane and tou thao, have been charged with aiding and abetting chauvin.

rioters set fire to the autozone near lake street and 27th ave. s. on may 27.

at least two people died in the subsequent riots, which eventually spread as far as north minneapolis and south st. paul, and caused roughly $500 million in damage. authorities have since charged a handful of people with arson-related crimes.

a widely shared livestream video from may 27 — two days after floyd's death — showed the man walking casually along the front of the former site of autozone at e. lake street and minnehaha, breaking out its windows with a 4-pound sledgehammer, prompting some protesters to confront him and demand that he stop. before that, police say, the man, clad head to toe in black and carrying a black umbrella, had spray-painted ""free [expletive] for everyone zone"" on the double front doors.

at the time, activists seized on the footage as proof that outside ""provocateurs"" were trying to derail what had been a mostly peaceful demonstration. but others on social media pointed out that at least some looting had gone on before the video surfaced.

christensen wrote in the affidavit that she watched ""innumerable hours"" of videos on social media platforms to try to identify ""umbrella man,"" to no avail. investigators finally caught a break when a tipster e-mailed the mpd identifying him as a member of the hells angels biker gang who ""wanted to sow discord and racial unrest by breaking out the windows and writing what he did on the double red doors,"" she wrote.

police have also connected the 32-year-old man to a widely publicized incident in stillwater late last month, in which a muslim woman was confronted by men wearing white supremacist garb.

a subsequent investigation revealed the man was also an associate of the aryan cowboy brotherhood, a small white supremacist prison and street gang based primarily in minnesota and kentucky. several of its members were also present at the stillwater incident.

andy shoemaker, a former st. paul police officer who has investigated criminal motorcycle gangs, said the aryan cowboys are relatively new with loyalties to the hells angels, who operate across the state.

""they're another group that's basically a farm system, a minor league for the hells angels,"" he said, adding the angels occasionally recruit members from some of these offshoot clubs.

the weeks that followed floyd's death brought dozens of reports of racially motivated assaults against minorities and minority-owned businesses.

leaked intelligence briefings show that federal authorities were monitoring the movements and online activity of white nationalists and other extremist groups that descended on the city during the riots. the president of the hells angels summoned 75 members of the aryan cowboy brotherhood to the help protect the club's headquarters in north minneapolis, according to an intelligence memo, which surfaced in june as part of a massive trove of leaked law enforcement documents dubbed ""blue leaks."" a club member later posted a warning to protesters on facebook saying that while the angels agreed with the anti-law enforcement message, any protests that reached the clubhouse or ""any of our neighborhoods"" would be ""met with a very unfriendly welcome party.""

another leaked memo suggested that local biker gangs were taking advantage of the unrest to step up their drug trafficking in the metro area, and that bikers ""associated with white racially motivated violent extremists"" had discussed inciting riots while posing as members of the anti-fascist group antifa. it wasn't immediately clear from the leaked materials whether any of these threats materialized.

after the protests began, footage of ""umbrella man"" roared around social media, prompting speculation about the man's identity. one persistent rumor argued ""umbrella man"" was an undercover st. paul police officer seeking to incite violence, a claim apparently based on a tweet citing information from a woman who claimed to have once been married to the officer.

in response, st. paul police released time-stamped surveillance videos showing that the officer was in st. paul at the time of the incident, and police chief todd axtell released a statement scolding social media users for spreading misinformation that could ""jeopardize the officer's reputation and safety and chip away at the trust this police department has worked so hard to build with its community.""

justin terrell, executive director of the council for minnesotans of african heritage, said conversations around floyd's death and the ensuing riots are important, but they often fail to account for the persistence of structural racism.

""i think at the end of the day, we need to start dealing with those issues, because i think this 'umbrella man,' he is a rotten piece of fruit at the farthest branch of the tree, [but] we've gotta get to the roots,"" terrell said. ""i think we have to do the work to get there, which america has never done, and minnesota sure hasn't.""

Reporters And Legal Observers Say Federal Officers In Portland Shot At Them,155,hzp4ts,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/federal-officers-shoot-mace-reporters-portland-lawsuit,30,1596006131.0,,"washington — journalists and legal observers covering protests in portland, oregon, say federal law enforcement officers have shot at them, maced them, and forced them to move, in violation of a federal judge's order.

us district judge michael simon entered a temporary restraining order on july 23 that blocks federal officers from arresting or using physical force against clearly marked journalists and legal observers in portland. in first-person declarations filed in court on tuesday, legal observers and reporters described being shot at and maced, and in some instances they provided video footage of the incidents.

lawyers for the journalists and legal observers are asking simon to hold the us department of homeland security and the us marshals service in contempt of court. they want simon to prohibit any federal agent who violates the temporary restraining order (tro) from being involved in ""armed operations"" in oregon; to consider a ""complete ban"" on the use of lethal or ""less lethal"" weapons by federal officers; and to order senior trump administration officials, including acting dhs secretary chad wolf and senior dhs official ken cuccinelli, to appear in court and explain why they shouldn't face sanctions.

""every day it has existed, federal agents have intentionally violated the court’s tro. as a result of the federal agents’ defiance of the court’s order, the free press remains unsafe while trying to document and observe the cataclysmic violence that federal authorities are inflicting on portland. the federal agents — and their commanders, whom the court ordered to be notified of the tro — are not above the law,"" lawyers representing the journalists and legal observers wrote.

the trump administration has deployed more than 100 federal officers to respond to demonstrations in portland, largely around the mark o. hatfield us courthouse. federal agents have been accused of using excessive force in their response to protests around the courthouse and of making unlawful arrests of protesters; one viral video appeared to show federal agents grabbing a person off the street and placing them into an unmarked van earlier this month.

attorney general bill barr defended the administration's response in testimony on tuesday before the house judiciary committee, saying that at night, the peaceful daytime protests have devolved into violence. the justice department on monday tweeted photos of items that federal officers confiscated from ""violent agitators"" outside the courthouse, including ""gasoline, hockey sticks, defense shields, leaf blowers, paint sprayers, paint cans with paint,"" and a jar it sad was ""prepped for a molotov cocktail.""

a justice department spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

the latest court filing from the american civil liberties union of oregon and other lawyers includes nine declarations from journalists and legal observers who alleged they were targeted by federal officers in violation of simon's order last week.



haley nicholson, who said in her declaration she was wearing a neon green legal observer hat while filming the demonstrations on july 24, included a link to a video that appears to show an officer pointing a gun through an opening in a fence and shooting into a group of people standing on the other side. nicholson said the officer shot her from about 4 feet away in her chest with a 40mm rubber bullet, and included a photo of the bruise."
"Police departments begin to withdraw from security agreements for 2020 DNC, some citing directive on crowd munitions",59,hztuwl,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/07/27/dnc-police-departments-withdraw-security-agreements-milwaukee/5520421002/,31,1596024501.0,[deleted],"close

at least 100 law enforcement agencies have withdrawn agreements to send personnel to next month's democratic national convention, some of them citing orders to milwaukee's police chief to cease the use of tear gas and pepper spray during demonstrations.

the withdrawals cast doubt on a program to bring about 1,000 police officers from outside agencies to help shore up security for the event, scheduled for the week of aug 17. among the agencies confirmed to have withdrawn are police departments in fond du lac, franklin, greendale and west allis.

asked on monday if the agreements were collapsing, fond du lac police chief william lamb said, ""yes,"" adding that he expects other agencies from across the state to withdraw from the program.

""we regret having to do that,"" said lamb, who chairs the wisconsin police executive group, which consists of police chiefs from cities with populations of more than 20,000 people.

the action by lamb and others comes as milwaukee's fire and police commission issued a directive last week to milwaukee police chief alfonso morales to change department policy to discontinue the use of tear gas and pepper spray.

morales spoke to several media outlets tuesday and told at least one that more than 100 law enforcement agencies had backed out of agreements with the city for security at the convention. in a letter to the u.s. department of justice sent two weeks ago, milwaukee officials listed fewer than 60 partner agencies as assisting with dnc security.

police confirmed tuesday afternoon that more than 100 law enforcement agencies are no longer assisting with the event.

""mpd’s top priority remains to ensure that next month’s dnc is a safe event for all visitors and participants,” the department said in the statement.

morales abruptly postponed a scheduled interview with the milwaukee journal sentinel tuesday afternoon.

""we respect the fire and police commission's decision,"" lamb said in an interview. ""but in this particular case, we strongly disagree with the actions they've taken. we believe (that) in removing those tools, the use of chemical irritants or pepper spray, from the available resources that the law enforcement officers would have at their disposal if protests become non-peaceful would severely compromise the safety of the public and also the safety of the law enforcement officers who would be assigned to protect the dnc.""

lamb sent a letter to milwaukee police on july 6 outlining his organization's concerns about limiting the use of tear gas and pepper spray. his group has not received a reply, he said, but added that he understands that the situation in milwaukee is ""fluid.""

west allis police first sent a letter to morales with concerns in mid-june after milwaukee's common council temporarily halted the purchase of those chemicals. a more recent bid for barricades, pepper spray, a ""tactical gas delivery system,"" food and drink for officers and other equipment appears on its way to being fulfilled.

but then came the directive from the milwaukee fire and police commission.

""our concern is that in the event protests turn non-peaceful, such a policy would remove tools from officers that may otherwise be legal and justifiable to utilize in specific situations,"" west allis deputy chief robert fletcher said in an email.

the decision to withdraw was not done lightly, he said, but the department believed such a policy would compromise the safety of officers and the public.

franklin police chief rick oliva raised similar concerns in a letter he sent to morales last week stating that his agency was no longer sending personnel to assist at the convention ""due to recent decisions by milwaukee elected and appointed officials.""

""it is apparent there is a lack of commitment to provide the milwaukee police department with the resources it needs to ensure the safety of peaceful protesters, attendees, citizens and police personnel,"" oliva wrote in his july 23 letter, copies of which were sent to mayor tom barrett, the common council president and the fpc. ""i can not send personnel if they are not properly equipped or will not be allowed to engage in appropriate actions which would ensure their safety.""

oliva noted in his letter that the agreement had said officers were to be provided ""sufficient resources to handle multiple unruly persons,"" and that the deal allowed for early termination if the city ""fails to comply with or perform any material term, condition or obligation contained in the agreement.""

in a letter to morales tuesday, greendale police chief ryan rosenow echoed oliva's message and said he would no longer be sending officers to assist.

waukesha's police chief said he is consulting with the city attorney's office on how to withdraw from the agreement, which had promised about two dozen waukesha officers.

""my position is we're not going to be sending our officers to support the dnc,"" said chief daniel thompson, who was hired in march after a 29-year career with the milwaukee police department.

""i understand that use of chemical irritants and pepper spray is serious and those are to be used only when legally justified,"" he said. ""but when you take that out of the continuum that doesn’t leave the officers much other than getting harmed or using deadly force and that’s not good for any officer or the public.""

the milwaukee police department declined to comment on the situation.

""for security purposes and the safety of the delegates and those attending the democratic national convention, the milwaukee police department declines to comment on the staffing for its operational plan,"" according to a statement released monday evening.

griselda aldrete, executive director of the fpc, referred questions about the issue to commissioner nelson soler, who did not respond to an interview request. soler serves as chairman of the policies and standards committee, which is reviewing operating procedures for crowd control.

other agencies remain, while some have stepped back for other reasons

some agencies are still planning to send officers to assist with the event.

green bay police chief andrew smith said at this point his department is one of them.

“we made a commitment that we would assist chief morales and the milwaukee police department,” smith said. “we intend to honor that commitment.”

glendale police captain rhett fugman said monday that his department still plans to send five officers to assist with the dnc.

west bend police chief kenneth meuler said he remains committed to sending about a dozen officers for the effort.

“i am confident that chief morales and city officials will work out an agreement to address the concerns that some of the other chiefs have raised,"" said meuler, a former milwaukee police department captain.

the wisconsin state patrol also still plans to provide security assistance at the dnc and so does the rock county sheriff's office.

milwaukee common council president cavalier johnson said the council has ""only asked for transparency when it comes to the use of chemical irritants — especially during a time when tensions between law enforcement and the community need to be de-escalated.""

""i’m very thankful to police forces from green bay, west bend and other communities from across wisconsin and the united states that not only will honor their commitment to provide security during the democratic national convention but also respect the moment that our nation is in as we collectively re-examine police-community relations,"" he said.

others are no longer sending officers to help but said the decision was made independently of concerns about the covid-19 pandemic and any recent directives.

eau claire police chief matt rokus said he decided against sending the 10 officers the agency had originally planned to send to assist with the convention in february.

""the commitment to send 10 officers was made by our previous chief, prior to my appointment,"" rokus said.

he added that eau claire previously had three large local music festivals and another large event planned that would have coincided with the original july dates of the dnc in milwaukee.

""it really had to do with local needs at the time,"" rokus said.

new jersey state police said monday that their deployment of about 55 people was canceled. no reason was given.

Trump Is Now Openly Defying the Supreme Court,345,i00tfi,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/daca-donald-trump-supreme-court.html,78,1596058580.0,,"the trump administration announced on tuesday that it will continue to defy a federal court order compelling the full restoration of daca, the obama-era program that allows 700,000 immigrants to live and work in the united states legally. by doing so, the administration has chosen to flout a decision by the supreme court, effectively rejecting the judiciary’s authority to say what the law is.

donald trump first attempted to rescind the deferred action for childhood arrivals program in september 2017, a move that would’ve stripped its beneficiaries of work permits and subjected them to deportation. but his administration continually cut corners, failing to explain the basis for its decision and refusing to consider the impact of daca repeal on immigrants, their communities, and their employers (including the u.s. army). this june, the supreme court ruled that the administration’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious” under federal law and therefore “set aside” daca repeal.

to implement that decision, u.s. district judge paul grimm compelled the administration to restore daca to its pre-repeal condition on july 17. grimm’s order required the department of homeland security to let daca beneficiaries renew their status for two years, accept new applicants, and restore “advance parole,” which permits travel outside the country. but dhs did not do that. instead, the agency maintained that it would reject new daca applicants. it also declined to accept daca renewals or reinstate advance parole.

at a hearing friday, grimm tore into justice department attorneys for flouting his order. the government’s actions, he explained, created “a feeling and a belief that the agency is disregarding binding decisions” from the supreme court. doj attorneys insisted that daca applications were merely “on hold,” or “placed into a bucket,” while the administration decided how to proceed. but, as grimm retorted, “it is a distinction without a difference to say that this application has not been denied, it has been received and it has been put in a bucket.” the judge once again directed dhs to comply with the law by accepting new applicants and processing renewals.

incredibly, the agency has decided to disobey this order, as well. on tuesday, acting dhs secretary chad wolf declared that it would not accept new applications and would only grant one-year extensions to current beneficiaries “on a case by case basis.” this tactic will make it easier for trump to deport daca beneficiaries if he wins reelection, since their status will expire sooner. the agency will also deny advance parole “absent exceptional circumstances.” this new policy is nothing less than brazen defiance of a federal court ruling. grimm, and the supreme court itself, ordered daca’s full resuscitation, which requires the acceptance of new applicants and the conferral of two-year renewals. there is simply no legal basis for dhs’s zombie version of the program.

the administration has tried this malfeasance before with a different policy—and it didn’t work then, either. after the supreme court blocked trump’s addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, trump insisted they would find a way to do it anyway. that court decision, too, found that the government had violated the law through dishonest incompetence. and in its aftermath, the administration scrambled to work around scotus and snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat. it failed, though not before tiptoeing up to the line of defying the supreme court.

now the administration has crossed that line—sprinted past it, really, without any apparent hesitation. it is true that scotus allowed the trump administration to take another stab at rescinding daca. but wolf’s memo does not purport to initiate a new process of winding down the program. rather, wolf presented these new rules as “interim changes” while dhs decides how to repeal daca legally. certainly, the agency can go back to the drawing board and devise a new method of killing the program. but neither the supreme court’s decision nor grimm’s order gave wolf the power to “limit [daca’s] scope in the interim.”

it is no surprise that dhs, whose agents are unconstitutionally kidnapping and brutalizing peaceful protesters in portland, oregon, would disregard the law. trump is doubling down on his smash-and-grab approach to governance. while the president demands law and order and attorney general william barr complains about mass disrespect of authority, the administration is intent on getting its way even when it means ignoring a federal court order. the president’s men are restrained only by their own sense of what they can get away with.

washington (ap) — russian intelligence services are using a trio of english-language websites to spread disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, seeking to exploit a crisis that america is struggling to contain ahead of the presidential election in november, u.s. officials said tuesday.

two russians who have held senior roles in moscow’s military intelligence service known as the gru have been identified as responsible for a disinformation effort meant to reach american and western audiences, u.s. government officials said. they spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

the information had previously been classified, but officials said it had been downgraded so they could more freely discuss it. officials said they were doing so now to sound the alarm about the particular websites and to expose what they say is a clear link between the sites and russian intelligence.

between late may and early july, one of the officials said, the websites singled out tuesday published about 150 articles about the pandemic response, including coverage aimed either at propping up russia or denigrating the u.s.

among the headlines that caught the attention of u.s. officials were “russia’s counter covid-19 aid to america advances case for détente,” which suggested that russia had given urgent and substantial aid to the u.s. to fight the pandemic, and “beijing believes covid-19 is a biological weapon,” which amplified statements by the chinese.

the disclosure comes as the spread of disinformation, including by russia, is an urgent concern heading into november’s presidential election as u.s. officials look to avoid a repeat of the 2016 contest, when a russian troll farm launched a covert social media campaign to divide american public opinion and to favor then-candidate donald trump over democratic opponent hillary clinton. the u.s. government’s chief counterintelligence executive warned in a rare public statement friday about russia’s continued use of internet trolls to advance their goals.

even apart from politics, the twin crises buffeting the country and much of the world — the pandemic and race relations and protests — have offered fertile territory for misinformation or outfight falsehoods. trump himself has come under scrutiny for sharing misinformation about a disproven drug for treating the coronavirus in videos that were taken down by twitter and facebook.

officials described the russian disinformation as part of an ongoing and persistent effort to advance false narratives and cause confusion.

they did not say whether the effort behind these particular websites was directly related to the november election, though some of the coverage appeared to denigrate trump’s democratic challenger, joe biden, and called to mind russian efforts in 2016 to exacerbate race relations in america and drive corruption allegations against u.s. political figures.

though u.s. officials have warned before about the spread of disinformation tied to the pandemic, they went further on tuesday by singling out a particular information agency that is registered in russia, inforos, and that operates a series of websites — inforos.ru, infobrics.org and oneworld.press — that have leveraged the pandemic to promote anti-western objectives and to spread disinformation.

officials say the sites promote their narratives in a sophisticated but insidious effort that they liken to money laundering, where stories in well-written english — and often with pro-russian sentiment — are cycled through other news sources to conceal their origin and enhance the legitimacy of the information.

the sites also amplify stories that originate elsewhere, the government officials said.

full coverage: virus outbreak

an email to inforos was not immediately returned tuesday.

beyond the coronavirus, there’s also a focus on u.s. news, global politics and topical stories of the moment.

a headline tuesday on inforos.ru about the unrest roiling american cities read “chaos in the blue cities,” accompanying a story that lamented how new yorkers who grew up under the tough-on-crime approach of former mayors rudy giuliani and michael bloomberg “and have zero street smarts” must now “adapt to life in high-crime urban areas.”

another story carried the headline of “ukrainian trap for biden,” and claimed that “ukrainegate” — a reference to stories surrounding biden’s son hunter’s former ties to a ukraine gas company — “keeps unfolding with renewed vigor.”

u.s. officials have identified two of the people believed to be behind the sites’ operations. the men, denis valeryevich tyurin and aleksandr gennadyevich starunskiy, have previously held leadership roles at inforos but have also served in a gru unit specializing in military psychological intelligence and maintain deep contacts there, the officials said.

inforos and one world’s ties to the russian state have attracted scrutiny in the past from european disinformation analysts.

in 2019, a european union task force that studies disinformation campaigns identified one world as “a new addition to the pantheon of moscow-based disinformation outlets.” the task force noted that one world’s content often parrots the russian state agenda on issues including the war in syria.

a report published last month by a second, nongovernmental organization, brussels-based eu disinfolab, examined links between inforos and one world to russian military intelligence. the researchers identified technical clues tying their websites to russia and identified some financial connections between inforos and the government.

“inforos is evolving in a shady grey zone, where regular information activities are mixed with more controversial actions that could be quite possibly linked to the russian state’s information operations,” the report’s authors concluded.

on its english-language facebook page, inforos describes itself as an “information agency: world through the eyes of russia.”

U.S. economy suffers titanic 32.9% plunge in 2nd quarter and points to drawn-out recovery,43,i0mxrh,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/economy-suffers-titanic-329-plunge-in-2nd-quarter-gdp-shows-and-points-to-drawn-out-recovery-2020-07-30,17,1596147916.0,,"the numbers: an economy badly battered by the coronavirus shrank at a record 32.9% annual pace in the second quarter, underscoring just how big a hole the u.s. finds itself in as it labors to recover from the deepest recession in american history.

the tidal wave of damage from the first global pandemic in a century was almost as bad as wall street expected. analysts polled by marketwatch had forecast a 35% decline in gross domestic product at an annual pace, the official scorecard of the u.s. economy.

the economy began to recover in mid-may after a severe contraction at the beginning of the quarter, but the u.s. faces a long road back, analysts say. millions of americans are still out of work, thousands of businesses have closed and many of those that remain open have had to scale back operations because of tepid demand or ongoing government restrictions.

the recent surge in coronavirus cases in about half of u.s. states, especially large ones such as texas, florida and california, has also dealt a blow to a fragile economic recovery.

previously gdp had never shrunk by more than 10% on an annualized basis in any quarter since the government began keeping track shortly after world war two.

what happened: consumer spending, the main engine of the economy, contracted by a record 34.6% annualized clip in the spring.

the decline was especially sharp in services — travel, tourism, medical care, eating out and the like. businesses that rely on large groups of customers and heavy store traffic bore the brunt of government lockdowns after the pandemic erupted. spending on services nosedived at a 43.5% annual pace.

households also spent far less on goods, though the decline wasn’t quite as steep. purchases dropped 11.3%. americans bought more cars, groceries and certain other household staples with many working from home, but sales of clothing, gasoline and many other goods all fell sharply.

business investment also stumbled badly as companies froze or slashed spending. outlays on infrastructure such as oil rigs sank 35% while spending on equipment shrank by 37.7%. both are record declines.

investment in new housing also shriveled up by 38.7%, but it appears to have sprung back quickly. record low mortgage rates have spawned a rash of new home sales and spurred builders to step up construction toward the end of the quarter.

the level of inventories also shrank by a whopping $234.6 billion annual rate in the second quarter, compared to an $80 billion dropoff in the first quarter.

companies cut back on production as sales slumped and exports tumbled. that’s also weighed heavily on the economy, though production has picked up in the last few months after the economy largely reopened.

government spending was a mixed bag. the federal government stepped in with massive infusions of aid for businesses, households and the unemployed, but states and localities have suffered a big drop in tax revenue even as expenses soared.

overall government outlays edged up 2.7% in the spring. federal spending jumped more than 17%, offsetting a 5.6% decline in state and local outlays.

international trade was a smaller drag on the economy. exports dwindled by 64% in the second quarter, topping a 53% drop in imports. the coronavirus caused massive disruptions in the flow of global trade and a worldwide economic slump resulted in far less demand.

read:u.s. trade deficit in goods falls 6% as exports rebound, but the big picture is still ugly

it may be months if not years before trade fully recovers, economists say, especially with the u.s. and china still at loggerheads on a number of issues. the two countries have the world’s largest economies.

the rate of inflation, meanwhile, fell at a 1.9% pace in the second quarter after increasing early in the year. the cost of many goods and services have fallen as companies cut prices to try to drum up sales. inflation is likely to remain low until the pandemic fades.

looking back at the first quarter, the originally reported 5% drop in gdp was unchanged. the pandemic struck in early march and tore a huge hole the economy in the final month of the quarter.

big picture: the economy is primed to expand in the third quarter, but the surge in coronavirus cases in many u.s. states has already taken some air out of the recovery. economists polled by marketwatch predict gdp will expand at an 18% annual pace from july to september, though estimates are likely to be ratcheted down.

the path of the recovery depends heavily on whether congress passes another massive relief package, economists say, and whether the pandemic is brought under control again. prolonged uncertainty will only cause americans to save more and spend less, thus hurting the economy.

Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain dies after battle with coronavirus,139,i0n6q4,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/former-gop-presidential-candidate-herman-cain-dies-after-battle-with-coronavirus.html,10,1596148807.0,,"herman cain, a former presidential hopeful who was once considered by president donald trump for the federal reserve, has died after being hospitalized with the coronavirus. he was 74.

cain's death was announced thursday on his website by dan calabrese, who edits the site and had previously written about his colleague's diagnosis.

""herman cain – our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us – has passed away,"" calabrese said in the blog post. ""we all prayed so hard every day. we knew the time would come when the lord would call him home, but we really liked having him here with us, and we held out hope he'd have a full recovery.""

cain was among the highest-profile public figures in the united states to have died from covid-19. less than two weeks before receiving his diagnosis, cain attended trump's campaign rally in tulsa, oklahoma, which had been staged despite concerns about mass gatherings during the pandemic.

cain, a stage 4 cancer survivor, tweeted a photograph of himself at trump's rally showing him surrounded by other attendees, none of whom appeared to be wearing masks or other protective gear.

cain tweet june 20

a july 2 statement from cain's social media accounts announcing his hospitalization said, ""there is no way of knowing for sure how or where mr. cain contracted the coronavirus."" the trump campaign said after cain's diagnosis that he had not met with the president at the tulsa rally.

the campaign said that all attendees at the event had their temperatures checked upon entry, and that masks and hand sanitizer were handed out but not required to use. before the event, the campaign revealed that six members of the team involved in the rally preparations had tested positive for the virus and had been quarantined.

trump later thursday tweeted his condolences for cain and his family.

""my friend herman cain, a powerful voice of freedom and all that is good, passed away this morning,"" the president wrote. ""herman had an incredible career and was adored by everyone that ever met him, especially me. he was a very special man, an american patriot, and great friend.""

trump tweets

at a thursday evening press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic, trump added that cain ""was a very special person, i got know him very well. and unfortunately he passed away from a thing called the china virus.""

white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany had earlier tweeted that cain ""embodied the american dream and represented the very best of the american spirit.""

mcenany tweet

cain had been hospitalized in atlanta on july 1, two days after being told he had tested positive for covid-19, according to his social media.

he did not require a respirator and was ""awake and alert"" when he checked in to the hospital, the statement said. ""please join with us in praying for mr. cain, and for everyone who has contracted the coronavirus – as well as their families,"" it said.

cain had been a business executive and board chairman of a branch of kansas city's federal reserve bank before moving into republican politics and eventually becoming a presidential candidate and a favorite of the conservative tea party faction.

last year, trump briefly considered picking cain as his nominee to join the federal reserve board. cain remained a vocal supporter of trump's after his nomination was withdrawn.

a former ceo of the restaurant chain godfather's pizza, cain became a player in republican politics as an economic advisor to bob dole's 1996 presidential campaign before briefly launching his own bid in 2000.

in the 2012 gop presidential primary season, cain gained outsized media coverage with his catchy ""9-9-9"" economic plan to replace much of the federal tax code with a 9% business transactions tax, a 9% personal income tax and a 9% sales tax. critics called the plan ""dubious"" and impractical.

sen. mitt romney of utah, who would clinch the gop nomination in 2012, tweeted thursday that he was saddened to hear of cain's passing.

romney tweet

cain suspended that campaign in december 2011 following multiple allegations of sexual harassment, ranging back to his time as chief executive of the national restaurant association in the 1990s. cain denied the allegations.

after his hospitalization, cain's social media accounts occasionally provided vague updates on his condition. a message on july 5 said he was ""making progress"" and that ""more encouraging news"" was expected to come soon. two days later, cain's twitter account said ""doctors are trying to make sure his oxygen levels are right.""

on july 10, another tweet said cain himself described his status as ""cruise control,"" because ""the progress is slow but his breathing is getting stronger every day. make no mistake: he is improving!""

cain tweet july 5 making progress

the most recent update came monday, when cain's social media revealed that he was ""being treated with oxygen for his lungs"" nearly a month after entering the hospital. ""he really is getting better, which means it is working,"" the update said.

calabrese repeatedly declined cnbc's requests for additional information on cain's condition throughout his struggle with the virus.

""we're not saying anything else beyond what we've posted on social media,"" calabrese said in a july 7 email. ""that's herman's and gloria's wish so i appreciate you respecting it.""

in addition to his wife gloria etchison, survivors include his two children, melanie and vincent, calabrese said.

Judge orders Trump to halt immigration wealth test during national coronavirus emergency,9,i0nct3,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-orders-trump-to-halt-immigration-wealth-test-national-coronavirus-emergency/,11,1596149417.0,,"a federal judge in new york on wednesday ordered the trump administration to stop enforcing a sweeping wealth test on people applying for green cards and visas for the duration of the national emergency over the coronavirus, agreeing with democratic-led states that the rules discourage immigrants from seeking public assistance during the pandemic.

the ""public charge"" rule first went into effect in february after the supreme court set aside lower court orders that had blocked the regulation, which gives officials more power to deny applications for green cards and visas from immigrants or prospective immigrants whom the government determines rely — or could rely — on certain government programs, like food stamps and housing vouchers.

""defendants' interest in effectuating the rule fails to measure up to the gravity of this global pandemic that continues to threaten the lives and economic well-being of america's residents,"" judge george daniels of the u.s. district court in manhattan wrote in his order, referring to the government. ""no person should hesitate to seek medical care, nor should they endure punishment or penalty if they seek temporary financial aid as a result of the pandemic's impact.""

since immigrants in the u.s. applying for green card status don't qualify for most welfare programs, the public charge rule mostly affects those seeking to move to the country from abroad. to determine whether prospective immigrants are likely to become a ""public charge,"" caseworkers consider their wealth, age, educational skills, english language proficiency and health.

in april, the attorneys general in new york, connecticut and vermont asked the supreme court to reconsider its decision to allow the public charge regulation to remain in place, saying the restrictions were hindering nationwide efforts to contain the spreading coronavirus. the high court denied their request but left open the possibility for the states to pursue relief in lower courts.

the states files declarations by doctors, local officials and advocates who said immigrants across the country fear they could jeopardize their immigration status by seeking medical treatment and government aid during the pandemic. citing these declarations, daniels said in his order that the public charge regulation was presenting immigrants with an ""impossible choice between jeopardizing health and personal safety or their immigration status.""

on thursday, a spokesperson for u.s. citizenship and immigration services, which administers the public charge rule, said the agency was ""currently reviewing"" wednesday's court order. ""uscis will fully comply with the court's order and will be providing additional guidance,"" the spokesperson added.

the government can seek to appeal wednesday's order. a spokesperson for the justice department did not respond to a request for comment.

in a separate order on wednesday, daniels also blocked the state department, which oversees visa processing abroad, from implementing its own version of the public charge rule. a state department spokesperson declined to comment or confirm that the rule's implementation had been halted, citing pending litigation."

rev. clayton said the national association for the advancement of colored people (naacp) will soon be filing a written complaint to gov. phil murphy — who ordered the vote-by-mail only election — and state attorney general grubir grewal.

paterson activist ernest rucker said his experience this election is an example of the kind of corruption that allegedly took place. rucker said he never received a ballot but that election records show someone mailed in a ballot in his name.

“i was robbed of the right to vote or not vote,” rucker said. “i was disenfranchised.”

new jersey deputy assembly speaker benjie wimberly and his family had a different issue. “my vote and my wife and two sons’ votes did not count in this past municipal election,” he said.

wimberly said he is a supporter of gov. murphy but given the history of vote-by-mail controversies, the governor should have done more to allow in-person voting and to ensure safeguards were in place for those ballots sent by mail. that one in five ballots were eliminated, some due to alleged corruption, wimberly said he was ""fed up with this … that’s how you disenfranchise voters. that’s the bottom line.”

wimberly said he was still waiting for an explanation from the board of elections as to why his family’s votes were set aside. he said if the issue is a signature matching the one on file, it's possible for signatures can change over the years. he said the voting booths should be open for elections, adding that if people can shop in supermarkets and liquor stores using checkout machines, they can do it for elections too.

“it is what is right for the people,” wimberly said. “we need in-person voting machines with social distancing.”

in paterson, new jersey, over eight hundred ballots were eliminated due to ballot stuffing and other allegations, however two thousand other ballots have been eliminated without an explanation.

murphy ordered elections vote-by-mail in an attempt to keep people safe during the coronavirus crisis. in the upcoming primary, the governor will allow one in-person voting site per town.

in addition to apparent problems with the vote count in paterson, nbc new york has shown video of ballots left out in building lobbies, of one voter handling many ballots, and reported on postal workers reporting finding hundreds of ballots at a time stuffed in mailboxes in paterson – and even in a neighboring town, haledon.

two councilmembers are demanding a recount and criminal investigation. mohammed akhtaruzzaman said wednesday his lawyer filed a formal appeal with the courts. “the integrity of this election is in question,” he said.

“(authorities) should take a close look at how the paterson election went, put the corrective action in place and if there is wrongdoing i would hope they would uncover that and take all appropriate action,"" said longtime councilman bill mckoy.

a winning candidate, luis velez, agreed. he added that authorities need to be more transparent given the widespread fraud allegations.

“the individuals conducting the investigation should come out and talk and bring back the confidence of those voters and where they stand with those investigations,"" velez said.

to date spokespersons for the state attorney general, the nj secretary of state, the fbi and u.s. attorney have all declined to say if an investigation is underway. numerous residents and candidates have said fbi agents and investigators from other agencies have been in town asking questions. a spokesman for the justice department civil rights division in washington dc also had no comment.

murphy has said the problems in paterson would be looked at but advised one paterson resident who had raised doubts about the process to “keep the faith.”

assemblyman wimberly, who said he is a strong murphy supporter, said he has been disappointed in the governor’s response to date. “keep the faith is not the answer any voter is looking for in particular the 3,200 voters who had their votes thrown out in this past municipal election.”

the vote for the council means control of $300 million in spending. add in school funding and state aid, the city budget totals nearly $1 billion dollars. veteran paterson press writer and editor joe malinconico said paterson has a history of voter fraud and election controversies. malinconico said one key question unanswered by election officials is why those 3,200 votes were apparently rejected.

“what is the track record on rejecting vote-by-mail ballots?” malinconico said is another issue. malinconico is awaiting word from the board of elections as to what percentage of mail votes were rejected in the past as compared to 19 percent seemingly rejected in this all vote-by-mail election.

“it’s one out of every five people, imagine that. if one out of five people showed up at the polls on election day and were turned away, we would have an incredible backlash in this country.”"

Unsealed Epstein documents detail alleged abuse by Ghislaine Maxwell,3,i17yor,https://thehill.com/homenews/news/509932-unsealed-epstein-documents-detail-alleged-abuse-by-ghislaine-maxwell,3,1596232721.0,,"court documents unsealed late thursday detail alleged abuse by ghislaine maxwell, a british socialite and associate of jeffrey epstein who is facing criminal charges.

the trove of more than 600 pages of documents were released by u.s. district judge loretta preska, an appointee of former president george w. bush, and are part of maxwell's now-settled 2015 civil defamation lawsuit brought by virginia roberts giuffre.

giuffre is an alleged victim of epstein who accused both maxwell and epstein of recruiting her when she was 15.

maxwell was charged this month with her involvement in sexual abuse perpetrated by epstein, a disgraced financier who took his own life while in custody last year. she is accused of recruiting young girls for epstein and at times of participating in the abuse.

she has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

in the deposition, giuffre is asked to give the names of the men maxwell told her to have sex with. she said that maxwell ""trained me as a sex slave.""

""i'm trying to tell you that they both did, ghislaine and jeffrey both directed me,"" giuffre told prosecutors. “they both paid me and they both directed me.""

two of the prominent figures included in the claims are britain's prince andrew and former new mexico gov. bill richardson (d), who have both denied accusations of misconduct.

giuffre also told prosecutors that former president bill clinton william (bill) jefferson clintonrepublicans can – and must – ensure a peaceful transfer of power former presidents clinton, carter congratulate biden and harris on victory sunday shows preview: joe biden wins the 2020 election more epstein’s private caribbean island, where “orgies were a constant thing that took place.” clinton has previously denied ever going to epstein’s island.

the deposition also mentions celebrity attorney alan dershowitz alan morton dershowitzthe hill's 12:30 report: war over the supreme court dershowitz suing cnn for 0 million in defamation suit bannon and maxwell cases display doj press strategy chutzpah more, who defended himself on twitter friday morning, demanding the “release of all documents because they contain emails and manuscripts proving in guiffre’s own words that she never met me.”

giuffre often told prosecutors that she met with dozens at the will of maxwell and epstein and does not recall the details of each encounter, which is common among victims of sexual abuse.

among the trove of documents are emails between maxwell and epstein in 2015 where he tells her she has done ""nothing wrong,” which appears to contradict her attorney’s previous claims that the two had not been in contact for more than a decade.

maxwell’s attorneys tried to stop the release of the documents. preska announced last week she would unseal the records pending an appeal because “any minor embarrassment” in releasing them is “far outweighed by the presumption of public access.”"

Supreme Court declines to halt Trump border wall,26,i1gv43,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/510073-supreme-court-declines-to-halt-trump-border-wall,2,1596262793.0,,"the supreme court on friday declined to block the trump administration from using $2.5 billion in reallocated pentagon funds to build a u.s.-mexico border wall.

in a 5-4 ruling that broke along ideological lines, the court's conservative majority denied a bid by interest groups to halt construction after a federal appeals court last month said the use of defense funding for the project is illegal. the court’s four more liberal justices dissented from the ruling.

the sierra club, american civil liberties union (aclu) and other challengers had asked the justices to lift their order from last july that allowed president trump donald john trump republican philadelphia official responsible for vote counting says office getting death threats biden will call governors, mayors about mask mandate trump campaign voter fraud hotline flooded with prank calls more to begin spending the funds while legal challenges proceeded through the courts.

but the friday ruling means the court’s july 2019 order, also decided 5-4, remains in effect despite a ruling by a federal appeals court in california last month that trump’s diversion of defense, military and other funding was unconstitutional.

justice stephen breyerstephen breyerbarrett to use supreme court chambers previously used by ruth bader ginsburg justice barrett's baptism by fire: protecting the integrity of elections supreme court reinstates ban on curbside voting in alabama more, in dissent, said he feared the majority’s ruling “may operate, in effect, as a final judgment.”

legal challenges arose early last year after trump declared a national emergency at the southern border to free up additional funding. that came after a congressional spending bill allocated some $1.3 billion for border security, far short of the nearly $5 billion trump said was needed to complete his signature project.

trump then reallocated $2.5 billion in funding that congress appropriated for defense and military uses.

a federal district court halted use of the reappropriated funds. but the supreme court’s july 2019 ruling allowed construction to move forward while the case proceeded through the courts.

last month, a divided three-judge panel of the 9th circuit court of appeals in california ruled against trump’s financing maneuver.

the court said the administration had violated the appropriations clause of the constitution, which gives congress the exclusive power of the purse. the decision affirmed a lower court’s injunction against the use of defense funds to build the wall.

“these funds were appropriated for other purposes, and the transfer amounted to ‘drawing funds from the treasury without authorization by statute and thus violating the appropriations clause,’ ” the majority wrote. “therefore, the transfer of funds here was unlawful.”"
Kushner COVID-19 plan axed because virus hit Democrats worst: report,236,i1hkfg,https://www.businessinsider.com/kushner-covid-19-plan-maybe-axed-for-political-reasons-report-2020-7,42,1596265365.0,[deleted],"some members of jared kushner's coronavirus task force believed the pandemic would affect democratic areas worse and may have adjusted accordingly, vanity fair reported.

in march and early april, kushner gathered a team to devise a nationwide coronavirus testing plan.

an public-health expert in regular contact with the team told the magazine that ""the political folks"" thought a nationwide response was a bad political move.

at the time, outbreaks were worst in democratic-voting states and cities. the source suggested that some close to kushner thought it was best to hold back and blame governors.

the white house has refuted this source's account, saying it is ""completely incorrect.""

kushner's plan was indeed dropped in favor of a mainly state-by-state response. since then, cases have surged in states on both sides of the political divide.

visit business insider's homepage for more stories.

members of jared kushner's coronavirus task force considered a national-scale testing plan early in the us's coronavirus outbreak.

however, according to a new vanity fair report, the plan never came to be, partly because the task force thought it would be better politically to hold off.

the logic, a source told vanity fair, was that the virus would hit democratic-voting areas hardest and that the damage could be blamed on governors instead.

in march and early april, kushner, a senior white house adviser, led a task force, parallel to the white house's official efforts, to devise a plan to accelerate coronavirus testing and supply chains nationwide.

ultimately, that was abandoned, and president donald trump shifted much of the responsibility for controlling outbreaks to individual states.

a public-health expert who was in regular contact with kushner's team told vanity fair's katherine eban that political reasoning may have influenced the decision.

""the political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,"" the unnamed expert said.

the expert also said the final call would have been kushner's. ""it was very clear that jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what [plan] was going to come out,"" they said.

in a statement, white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany refuted the claims made in the vanity fair article, saying: ""the premise of this article is entirely false.""



she added: ""further, the article is completely incorrect in its assertion that any plan was stopped for political or other reasons.""

when the team was working, new york was the epicenter of the us's coronavirus outbreak, with more than 300,000 cases by early april.

the president wore a face mask in public for the first time in early july, and he has recently signaled a more serious take on a pandemic that he had previously downplayed.

on monday, however, reports emerged that trump's pivot may have been motivated by advisers showing him increases in cases in republican and swing states — ""our people,"" a senior administration official told the washington post.

several states, both red and blue, have seen significant increases in coronavirus cases since beginning to ease lockdowns. arizona, florida, and texas — all of which have republican governors — are among the states that now have more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people."
Lawmakers ‘Alarmed’ by Reports U.S. Envoy Told Brazil It Could Help Re-elect Trump - The House Foreign Affairs Committee has begun an inquiry into multiple reports in the Brazilian media that the U.S. ambassador was framing negotiations over ethanol tariffs in partisan terms,409,i1syu7,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/world/americas/brazil-trump-ethanol-chapman.html,50,1596320503.0,,"rio de janeiro — members of the house foreign affairs committee said friday they were “extremely alarmed” by assertions that the american ambassador in brazil had signaled to brazilian officials they could help get president trump re-elected by changing their trade policies.

in a letter sent friday afternoon, committee chairman eliot l. engel demanded that the ambassador, todd chapman, produce “any and all documents referring or related to any discussions” he has held with brazilian officials in recent weeks about their nation’s tariffs on ethanol, an important agricultural export for iowa, a potential swing state in the american presidential election.

the committee’s letter was sent in response to reports in the brazilian news media this week saying that mr. chapman, a career diplomat, made it clear to brazilian officials they could bolster mr. trump’s electoral chances in iowa if brazil lifted its ethanol tariffs.

eliminating tariffs would give the trump administration a welcome trade victory to present to struggling ethanol producers in iowa, where the president is in a close race with his democratic rival, joseph r. biden jr."

St. Louis prosecutor to detective on McCloskey case: 'I suggest you quickly reassess this evidence',61,i22uxu,https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/crime/i-suggest-you-quickly-re-assess-this-evidence-st-louis-prosecutor-to-detective-on-mccloskey-case/63-8abf5d89-1aeb-46b7-bad2-cc1a482e945e,6,1596356357.0,,"documents show lead detective initially refused to sign documents prosecutors wrote about the case

st. louis — the lead st. louis police detective investigating the mccloskey case refused to sign at least two versions of court documents prosecutors drafted, according to a review of those documents obtained by 5 on your side.

in addition, police contend at least one person in the crowd was armed and another was wearing a bullet-resistant vest, after analyzing videos taken june 28, when the couple confronted protesters with guns.

the case has attracted national attention since photos and video of the couple pointing guns at trespassing protesters went viral.

critics – nearly all republicans – have said circuit attorney kim gardner should not charge mark and patricia mccloskey because the state’s castle doctrine and stand-your-ground laws allow them to defend their property against perceived threats.

the documents obtained by 5 on your side include an email gardner’s assistant circuit attorney chris hinckley sent to the lead investigator on the case, sgt. curtis burgdorf. hinckley emailed police the day before the mccloskeys were served with a search warrant, stating it needed to happen “now.”

“at this point, everything points to these weapons being real and loaded, but no one has asked or confirmed,” he wrote. “come trial, they’ll say they were waiving around a bb gun and an air rifle.”

hinckley also wrote to burgdorf’s commander, maj. angela coonce.

“our office is receiving inquiries from the public and press about a warrant application and potential charges. we’ve thus far said the matter ‘remains under investigation.’ i’d really like to avoid pointing to a police follow-up request as the hold-up, but i won’t control the messaging if this goes on any longer. please see what you can do to help this along. again, i’m asking for priority on the firearms issue.”

the search warrant allowed officers to seize the guns the mccloskeys used during the encounter. the rifle mark mccloskey used was intact when it arrived at the crime lab. the pistol patricia mccloskey used was not, according to documents obtained by 5 on your side.

hinckley ordered the crime lab to disassemble and reassemble patricia mccloskey’s gun and signed a court document stating that it was “capable of lethal use” at the time she pointed it at protesters.

in a motion, gardner wrote that the law allows prosecutors to say both of the mccloskeys guns were readily capable of lethal use, “even without proof that they were functional or loaded at the time of the incident.”

the mccloskey’s attorney, joel schwartz, said patricia mccloskey’s gun was not functional because it was once used as a prop in a trial. the mccloskeys are both attorneys.

he said gardner’s interpretation of the law is wrong.

“it’s a loose interpretation of the statute and the law requires a weapon to be operable at the time of an offense,” he said.

a spokeswoman for gardner, a democrat, said she could not comment on a pending case.

hinckley also wrote the document the lead detective did sign, known as the probable cause statement.

but it went through at least two revisions after burgdorf outlined 14 concerns he had about the document, 5 on your side has learned.

among those concerns:

hinckley characterized the protest as “peaceful and organized” and that it was “calling attention to racial inequities in the criminal justice system.” burgdorf wrote that the evidence he gathered showed the protest was to call for the resignation of mayor lyda krewson. the final document called it “a protest march.”

hinckley wrote that patricia mccloskey’s was “armed with a semi-automatic handgun.” burgdorf wrote the phrase should read, “what appears to be a semi-automatic handgun.” hinckley responded, in part, “you cannot be serious with this one. again, this is really problematic.” ultimately, the document read: “what was later determined to be a semi-automatic handgun.”

hinckley called mark mccloskey’s gun an “assault” rifle. burgdorf called the word “assault” a propaganda term. hinckley disagreed, but it was left out of the final document.

hinckley wrote that the protesters passed through an “open gate” onto private property. burgdorf said he didn’t know whether the gate guarding the private street was open when protesters went through it, but that, at some point, it was damaged. hinckley responded: “your points here are really problematic. it seems to go beyond oversight and into purposeful ignorance. i suggest you very quickly re-assess this evidence.” ultimately the document burgdorf signed reads, “protesters walked through a gate.”

hinckley wrote that mark mccloskey’s gun was “visibly loaded with an ammunition clip.” burgdorf wrote that he would have to verify that detail because it wasn’t mentioned in his report or interviews with them. hinckley wrote back “seriously??!!” ultimately, the document did not include the phrase hinckley wrote.

hinckley wrote that both victims, identified only by their initials, “feared that the defendant might fire her weapon due to her finger being on the trigger and her highly agitated demeanor.” burgdorf wrote that the term “angrily” was subjective and he didn’t like it. hinckley wrote, “it’s a fact and an element of the offense.” the final document did not include the word ""angrily"".

5 on your side also obtained a voice mail hinckley left burgdorf after he wrote his response to burgdorf’s objections.

on it, he states: “curtis, you need to call me back. i wrote a long email to you trying to ask a bunch of questions about whatever it is you said some was (expletive). now we need to straighten this out because i’m about done with this crap. call me back.”

since the couple was charged july 20, burgdorf’s investigation has continued, according to the documents.

he noted in follow up reports that at least one of the protesters was armed with a handgun, and another was wearing a bullet-resistant vest with the words, “human shield” on it.

some of the phrases he was able to decipher from the footage collected by prosecutors from protesters included:

“you own a business. your business is gone.”

“we coming back baby.”

“you ain’t the only (expletive) with a gun.”

“they coming back to your house.”

in another livestream video, burgdorf wrote a man was heard saying, “i was in front so i was the one who opened the gate. the gate was broken after they pulled a gun. what law did we break? we keep guns there but not for show though. not to look a certain way, but for use. if they would’ve shot then they would’ve been put down.”

the only thing burgdorf wrote from what he could hear from the mccloskeys included patricia mccloskey shouting “go,” as she pointed her gun at demonstrators."
Samsung Electronics to halt production at its last computer factory in China,92,i28qla,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-china-pc-idUSKBN24X3K4,5,1596385334.0,,"file photo: the logo of samsung electronics is seen at its office building in seoul, south korea, march 23, 2018. reuters/kim hong-ji

seoul (reuters) - samsung electronics co will halt operations of its last computer factory in china, the south korean tech giant said on saturday, the latest manufacturer to shift production from the world’s second-biggest economy.

companies are rethinking their production and supply chains amid rising chinese labour costs, a u.s.-china trade war and the blow from the covid-19 pandemic.

around half the 1,700 employees on contract at samsung electronics suzhou computer will be affected, excluding those involved in research and development, the south china morning post reported on friday, citing a notice to samsung staff.

the factory shipped $4.3 billion worth of goods out of china in 2012, a figure that had sunk to $1 billion by 2018, the hong kong newspaper said.

a samsung spokeswoman declined to comment on the factory’s revenue and shipments, or details regarding employees.

“china remains an important market for samsung and we will continue to provide superior products and services for chinese consumers,” the company said in a statement.

samsung shut its last smartphone factory in china last year. its remaining facilities include two semiconductor manufacturing sites in suzhou and xi’an."
Two Women Charged in Attack on Wisconsin State Senator,193,i28yme,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/us/wisconsin-tim-carpenter-attacked.html,60,1596386719.0,,"he parked his car, and noticed a line of demonstrators pausing in a march. other people were standing around watching them, too.

mr. carpenter said he had participated in protests for years, in wisconsin and in washington, many in support of gay rights. “i got out of my car, just curious,” he said. he decided after a few minutes to record the demonstrators.

there was movement in the crowd, and then the two women, and possibly a third person, moved toward him. he said there was “no warning whatsoever” that he would be attacked.

“one of the two put her hand over the camera and pushed me back, and then the phone was knocked out of my hand,” he said. “that precipitated it. all of a sudden there were eight to 10 people, kicking and punching and doing all sorts of things.”

he said he supports peaceful protests and black lives matter.

“i tried telling them, ‘why are you doing this? i am an ally of yours,’” he said. “i am gay, i have been in the legislature for 36 years. that is when the beating kind of slowed down a bit.”

he said he was treated on the scene for a concussion, a broken nose and bruises by ambulance medics and then later by a family doctor.

there had been protests in madison for weeks, alongside those across the united states after mr. floyd’s death. but on the night that mr. carpenter was assaulted, the tenor of the marches had intensified after the arrest of a black activist, identified as devonere a. johnson, 28, at a restaurant near the capitol. video of that arrest shows officers pulling mr. johnson by the legs and carrying his body to force him into a police car."

edward schinzing, 32, was just around the corner on another night. prosecutors say he and 30 others broke into a building with a jail and courtrooms, destroyed an office and set it ablaze.

both were arrested. their disparate circumstances highlight what the associated press found in an analysis of more than 200 arrests: even those accused of breaking the law during the liberal city's nightly rallies don't neatly fit into president donald trump's depiction of protesters as ""anarchists and agitators.""

a review of court documents, social media posts and other public records from people arrested by federal and local authorities since mid-june reveals a group whose motives are as varied as the acts leading to their arrests.

they're black lives matter activists who have been in the streets since george floyd died at the hands of minneapolis police in may, groups of self-proclaimed parents using leaf blowers to drive away tear gas and black-clad provocateurs taking advantage of the nightly chaos that's gripped downtown portland for over two months and led trump to deploy federal agents in early july.

the ap found that 95% of those arrested by police and federal agents were local. the vast majority have no criminal record in oregon. many appear to be college students. their average age was 28, court records show.

they're mostly charged with misdemeanors like failing to comply with a lawful order, while some face felonies like arson and assault on an officer. most people have been released, and some have been arrested more than once for similar offenses.

the federal government agreed wednesday to draw down the number of agents whose presence has swelled the ranks of the protests. federal forces have drawn more black-clad people accused of setting fires or assaulting officers but also military veterans seeking to lower tensions and a self-titled ""wall of moms.""

""they have acted as an occupying force & brought violence,"" oregon gov. kate brown tweeted of the u.s. officers.

soon before the announcement, trump insisted agents wouldn't leave until local authorities ""secured their city."" he's spent weeks running portland through the political playbook he used during the initial wave of nationwide demonstrations after floyd's death: painting those on the streets as anarchists and seeking to tie them to democratic rival joe biden.

the u.s. justice department and homeland security officials have often highlighted destructive cases like schinzing's in their portrayal of protesters. the nightly unrest often follows a script: authorities declare a riot, sending hundreds of peaceful protesters home as smaller groups of demonstrators target the u.s. courthouse with bricks, laser pointers and fireworks. federal agents respond with tear gas, stun grenades and arrests.

but ap's analysis shows many of those arrested do not fit the caricature of an anarchist bent on destruction.

moments before her arrest, police threw mcferran, the sierra club manager, to the ground, yanking off her mask and binding her wrists in zip ties. she was released after eight hours in jail and faces charges of disorderly conduct and interfering with police.

mcferran, who lives in seattle, said she started protesting in her city and in portland almost nightly after realizing she could do more in the fight for racial justice. until floyd's killing, mcferran says she was a ""tourist protester.""

""i realized i need to be participating in this legitimately every day,"" she said. ""i need to do this work.""

mcferran said she and her boyfriend, a former army medic, provide security services and try to act as a ""shield"" between protesters of color and law enforcement.

some of those charged with more serious offenses, such as assaulting officers and destroying property, have criminal histories. most are white, according to court records.

schinzing, who was photographed burning papers inside the county justice center, was ordered detained this week by a federal judge. he faces a felony arson charge, on top of unrelated harassment and assault charges from february, court records show. his court-appointed attorney declined to comment.

acting homeland security chief chad wolf said federal agents have made 94 arrests in portland since july 4.

""our federal officers have faced assaults with molotov cocktails, mortar-style, commercial-grade fireworks, accelerants, ieds and other violent weapons,"" wolf said at a news conference about the withdrawal of federal agents.

lisa hay, oregon's federal public defender, said her office is representing ""mothers, college students, lawyers"" and others from across the state and country.

""it should concern everyone that there were arrests by unmarked police officers of oregonians who were asking what's going on and weren't being given any answers,"" hay said.

the state sued over those allegations, which the trump administration denies, but a judge found the state did not have standing to win an immediate court order restraining the federal agents.

some black activists say the political fight distracts from the focus on combating racist policing.

mac smiff, a 39-year-old father and analyst for a utility company, was arrested on june 6 and charged with interfering with a peace officer. he's confident the charge will be dismissed, saying he got caught up as police swept through downtown after a protest.

a veteran activist, smiff took to the streets after seeing a prominent politician talking about reducing funding for police on tv. he thought the wave of rallies following floyd's death seemed different, more focused, but said trump deriding protesters as violent extremists is a familiar strategy.

""if you make the blame indiscriminate, then you can make the response indiscriminate. that's just a tactic to justify using escalating force and chemical weapons against us,"" smiff said. ""i own my house. i'm a professional human being. i'm out here fighting against corruption and police brutality. and the response is i'm a terrorist? that's laughable at best.""

he welcomed the news that the federal presence in portland would be winding down, saying the agents were a ""distraction.""

“that was a side mission,” he said. “we came out here to defund the police.”"
The Coronavirus Infected Hundreds at a Georgia Summer Camp,297,i2dogn,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/coronavirus-children-camp.html,6,1596410180.0,,"as schools and universities plan for the new academic year, and administrators grapple with complex questions about how to keep young people safe, a new report about a coronavirus outbreak at a sleepaway camp in georgia provides fresh reasons for concern.

the camp implemented several precautionary measures against the virus, but stopped short of requiring campers to wear masks. the virus blazed through the community of about 600 campers and counselors, the centers for disease control and prevention reported on friday.

the staff and counselors gathered at the overnight camp in late june. within a week of the camp orientation, a teenage counselor developed chills and went home.

the camp, which the c.d.c. did not name, started sending campers home the next day, and shut down a few days later. by then, 76 percent of the 344 campers and staffers whose test results were available to c.d.c. researchers had been infected with the virus — nearly half the camp."

Many Americans Are Convinced Crime Is Rising In The U.S. They’re Wrong.,453,i33x8h,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-convinced-crime-is-rising-in-the-u-s-theyre-wrong/,50,1596512373.0,,"will you get robbed this year? how would you rate your chances?

over 10 years, from 1994 to 2004, the national survey of economic expectations asked respondents to do just that. people estimated their risks for a whole host of bad-news life events — robbery, burglary, job loss and losing their health insurance. but the survey didn’t just ask respondents to rate their chances: it also asked whether those things had actually happened to them in the last year.

and that combination of questions revealed something important about american fear: we are terrible at estimating our risk of crime — much worse than we are at guessing the danger of other bad things. across that decade, respondents put their chance of being robbed in the coming year at about 15 percent. looking back, the actual rate of robbery was 1.2 percent. in contrast, when asked to rate their risk of upcoming job loss, people guessed it was about 14.5 percent — much closer to the actual job loss rate of 12.9 percent.

in other words, we feel the risk of crime more acutely. we are certain crime is rising when it isn’t; convinced our risk of victimization is higher than it actually is. and in a summer when the president is sending federal agents to crack down on crime in major cities and local politicians are arguing over the risks of defunding the police, that disconnect matters. in an age of anxiety, crime may be one of our most misleading fears.

take the crime rate. in 2019, according to a survey conducted by gallup, about 64 percent of americans believed that there was more crime in the u.s. than there was a year ago. it’s a belief we’ve consistently held for decades now, but as you can see in the chart below, we’ve been, just as consistently, very wrong.

crime rates do fluctuate from year to year. in 2020, for example, murder has been up but other crimes are in decline so that the crime rate, overall, is down. and the trend line for violent crime over the last 30 years has been down, not up. the bureau of justice statistics found that the rate of violent crimes per 1,000 americans age 12 and older plummeted from 80 in 1993 to just 23 in 2018. the country has gotten much, much safer, but, somehow, americans don’t seem to feel that on a knee-jerk, emotional level.

“the biggest challenge really, and we’re seeing this as a society across the board right now, is that even though our organizations, our businesses, our government entities are becoming more data driven, we as human beings are not,” said meghan hollis, a research scholar at the ronin institute for independent scholarship.

that’s not to say that americans are completely clueless about crime. when we spoke to john gramlich, a senior writer with the pew research center and one of the people who has been tracking and writing about this disconnect for years, he was quick to clarify that pew didn’t like to frame americans’ apparent inability to register their own increased safety as a product of being uninformed or misinformed. the reality, he told us, is that the nature of data collection makes it hard for the public to really assess crime rates and for experts to assess what the public knows or feels about crime rates.

even the concept of a “crime rate” is messy. when we talk about crime rates in the context of an article like this one, what we’re actually discussing is the number of crimes, in a set of particular categories, that get reported to the police and, from there, to the federal bureau of investigation — or results from a government survey about whether people have experienced crime. these stats document murder, rape, robbery and assault, among others, as well as several property crimes, including burglary, theft, car theft, and arson. that covers a lot of ground, and it gives us a pretty good idea what the crime rate truly looks like — enough that experts feel comfortable saying things like “hey, look, the crime rate has been going down for 30 years.”

but those statistics don’t tell the whole story, and that matters in ways that become important when you’re trying to understand the difference between how people feel and what the data say. not all crimes are reported to the police. sexual assault, in particular, is notoriously underreported. and there are plenty of crimes we don’t really track well in data — like vandalism, drug use and sales, or public intoxication — which can affect how safe people feel in their neighborhoods, even if the crimes aren’t serious.

wesley skogan, professor emeritus of political science at northwestern university, spent much of the 1990s attending neighborhood-level public meetings around chicago and documenting the issues that residents told police were problems they wanted solved. some of these issues weren’t even, strictly speaking, crimes, at all. in 17 percent of the meetings, residents asked police to do something about litter. loud music or other noise-related problems were discussed in 19 percent of the meetings. residents complained about abandoned cars more often than they complained about gang problems. skogan thinks about these factors as measurements of social disorder, and has found evidence that these things affect how safe people feel. if violent crimes are down, but there’s still a good deal of social disorder in an area, people’s responses to a survey might reflect how they feel about litter more than how they feel about a reduced murder rate.

the way the polls are worded also don’t help. “the polling tends to be pretty generic,” said lisa l. miller, a political scientist at rutgers university who studies crime and punishment, which makes it hard to capture the difference between how americans think about murder and litter when it comes to how safe they feel. more importantly, she said, questions like “do you think crime has gone up or down?” is not the same thing as measuring fear. “when people are genuinely worried about crime and really fearful, it tends to be in relation to violent crime. that’s the thing i’ve found really drives public pressure for the government to do something,” she said.

this whole thing is further complicated because crime is extremely localized — and estimates about the national crime rate are, well, not.

“all the homicides in chicago occur in about 8 percent of the city’s census tracts,” skogan said. for almost everybody, he said, that means “the crime you hear about is crime somewhere else.” and that matters because research suggests people are a lot better at estimating the crime rate in their own backyard than they are at estimating what it’s like across town, or across the country.

finally, there’s the question of race, which permeates and complicates everything surrounding crime. it’s not just trash and loitering that make people perceive a neighborhood as more dangerous regardless of the crime rate. when lincoln quillian, a professor of sociology at northwestern university, analyzed data from three surveys of crime and safety in cities across america, he found that people perceive their neighborhood as more dangerous — regardless of the actual crime rate — if more young black men live there. that was true for both black and white respondents of the surveys, but in some cities the effect was significantly more pronounced in white people.

this is all a long-winded way of saying the situation is messy on many levels, but it remains true that people’s personal fear of being victims of crimes and their perceptions of national crime rates are far from accurate.

so why do americans still think crime is high?

turns out, the local news may be responsible for convincing americans that violent crime is more common than it really is. researchers have consistently found that “if it bleeds, it leads” is a pretty accurate descriptor of the coverage that local television broadcasters and newspapers focus on. for years, rarer crimes like murders received a lot more airtime than more common crimes like physical assault. and that hasn’t changed as the crime rate has fallen.

understandably, seeing stories about violent atrocities on the news every night seems to make people afraid that the same thing could happen to them. according to one study conducted in california, consumption of local television news significantly increased people’s perceptions of risk and fear of crime. “the news is not going to report on things that are going really well very often,” hollis said. “it’s not like ‘hey austin, texas doesn’t have a whole lot of crime and that’s our news for the day!'” stories about gun violence grab attention, so you get more stories about rare, but serious, crimes. “you can have people perceiving areas of cities as much more violent than they actually are because that’s what they see in the news,” she said. “it really amplifies that view of criminal activity beyond what it really is.”

there’s a significant amount of evidence, too, that reporting on crime can prop up harmful stereotypes: studies have found that local news media disproportionately portray black people as perpetrators of crime, and white people as victims.

there’s also plenty of fodder for this kind of coverage because even though crime has fallen a lot over the past few decades, the u.s. is still a pretty violent country, at least compared to other developed nations. “violence remains an american problem,” miller said. “just think about mass shootings. so in that sense it’s not irrational for people to be somewhat fearful of violence.”

but often, those fears can be blown out of proportion — not just by wall-to-wall murder coverage on the news, but also by politicians who bring up the crime rate in press conferences and interviews. president trump is far from the first president to paint a dark vision of crime in american cities, but he is singularly obsessed with the topic, especially now. according to a huffpost analysis, the vast majority of the ads his campaign aired in the month of july dealt in some way with public safety. in one ad, an elderly woman is robbed as text flashes across the screen reading, “you won’t be safe in joe biden’s america.”

and a recent study suggests that trump’s words could have an effect. researchers found that news coverage and political rhetoric — as measured by mentions of crime in presidential state of the union speeches — were significant indicators of whether americans thought crime was a pressing issue facing the country. the actual crime rate was not. a huffpost poll conducted from july 22 to 24 found something similar: only 10 percent of americans correctly believe that crime has fallen over the past decade, while 57 percent think crime has increased.

some americans may be more receptive to tough-on-crime rhetoric than others, of course. republicans are generally more apt to say that crime is a serious problem facing the country than democrats. and although pew analysis of polling data doesn’t uncover big racial differences in perceptions of crime, white and black americans likely think about crime very differently because criminal justice has become so inextricably tied to race.

hakeem jefferson, a political scientist at stanford university who studies race and justice, told us that black people’s views on criminal justice are complex, in part because they’re likelier than other demographic groups to actually live in high-crime neighborhoods and to be victims of crime. in other research, he’s found that some black people have also internalized negative stereotypes about who commits crime, and may be more likely to embrace punitive solutions as a result. those perceptions and experiences are hard to capture in public opinion data, but they can do a lot to shape what black people mean when they tell a pollster that they think crime is a serious issue facing the country. and that’s important, because as the past few decades have shown, black people are also much likelier to be mistreated by police, experience incarceration or grapple with the challenges of a criminal record.

regardless of what’s driving fear of crime, though, the fact that it is so out of whack with reality can make it really hard to change people’s minds or reform the criminal justice system. it’s not that an out-of-proportion fear of crime automatically leads people to support more punitive policies — right now, for instance, americans are mostly not in favor of more money for policing. but these misperceptions can make it harder for reforms to gain traction, particularly if politicians with a big national platform — like trump — are talking about out-of-control crime at every turn.

it’s not hard, for instance, to imagine that kind of rhetoric being used as a wedge against efforts to restructure local funding for the police. especially considering that in the past, a fear of crime has been used politically as a reason to oppose criminal justice reforms like reducing incarceration or changing the bail bond system — even though research suggests those reforms don’t increase crime in the long term.

the history of “law and order” campaigns is riddled with dog whistles, and trump’s recent rhetoric about sending federal agents to combat crime in cities like chicago arguably falls into this category, according to justin pickett, a criminologist at the university of albany who studies attitudes toward crime and justice. talking about the dangers of crime, he said, can turn into a cover for racist attitudes.

none of this has made us safer. and ironically, fear of crime can actually lead to other behaviors that put us at greater risk, like buying and carrying guns. if anxiety about crime keeps americans from embracing different ways of thinking about criminal justice, that may be doing more harm than good, too. for instance, there’s no real evidence that putting more people behind bars contributed to the decrease in crime or that imprisoning fewer people will raise crime. instead, a mountain of research points in the opposite direction to problems and inequalities linked to mass incarceration.

the trouble is that fear about crime isn’t rational, and it’s hard to convince people to think differently about a problem that they don’t experience on a day-to-day basis anyway. “you can tell americans that the crime rate is lower today than it was in the 1990s, but it won’t feel real to them,” said kevin wozniak, a sociologist at the university of massachusetts boston. “that is, unless politicians stop drumming up the crime rate and people stop hearing about murder every night on the local news.”

and that seems unlikely to happen in 2020."
"Gun sales spike among African-Americans: 'Our ancestors died for us to vote, they also died for us to be able to carry guns'",334,i38x2w,https://www.yahoo.com/news/gun-sales-spike-among-african-americans-our-ancestors-died-for-us-to-vote-they-also-died-for-us-to-be-able-to-carry-guns-215942257.html,85,1596528854.0,[deleted],"when americans panic, they buy guns — lots of them. during the first six months of 2020, amid a global coronavirus pandemic, gun retailers have reported a record 10.3 million firearm transactions, according to a new survey by the national shooting sports foundation. overall, gun sales in the u.s. have increased by 95 percent while ammunition sales have increased 139 percent compared to the same period last year.

and while various demographic groups are buying guns in 2020, african-americans account for the highest increase in gun purchases of any group.

“the highest overall firearm sales increase comes from black men and women, who show a 58.2% increase in purchases during the first six months of 2020 versus the same period last year,” jim curcuruto, nssf director of research and market development, wrote in his report. “bottom line is that there has never been a sustained surge in firearm sales quite like what we are in the midst of.”

in many states, estimated gun sales doubled in march compared with february. in utah, they nearly tripled. and in michigan, a coronavirus hot spot, sales more than tripled.

yet it’s not the first time gun sales have surged following an event with national implications. in 2012, more than 3 million were purchased in the months after the sandy hook elementary school massacre, in which a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, in newtown, conn. after this tragedy, americans feared stricter gun laws so they bought more guns. in the eight years under president obama, the gun industry grew 158 percent, according to the nssf, over fears of impending gun control.

while much of the spike in sales early on can be attributed to uncertainty surrounding business shutdowns and initial stay-at-home orders because of covid-19 precautions, more recent sales may be due to an uneasiness around black lives matter rallies and increased calls to defund police departments.

michael cargill, a black man and owner of central texas gun works in austin, texas, says that amid all the anxiety over the pandemic and rallies, people are buying guns to take personal responsibility for their safety. “people were concerned with people breaking into their home or breaking into their vehicle or attacking them while they’re in their vehicles [after covid-19],” he said in a video interview with yahoo news. “so people wanted to take their own protection into their own hands.”

story continues

michael cargill, owner of central texas gun works in austin, texas.

in the past few months, cargill says he’s seen triple the amount of people coming into his store wanting to purchase firearms, and he’s noticed a surge in black customers in particular. cargill believes black people are buying more guns because they are getting more educated on the history of gun control. “they’re understanding that gun control first started in the 1800s … so people are realizing that every time there's a gun law that’s targeting a certain group of people, it’s usually the african-american group,” he said. “so they’re saying, with everything going on, we’ve got to make sure that we’re legal with this firearm. we’re going to make sure we know what the law is, we want to make sure we know where we can take it, where we can’t take it.”

history shows that gun control laws have always been unfavorable to black americans. even before america was a country, black people were banned from owning guns. “the first gun control law in the territory that is now the united states was passed in virginia in 1640,” journalist daniel rivero noted in a 2016 splinter article. “it explicitly banned black people from owning guns, even if they were not slaves.”

more than 200 years later, in 1857, the prospect of armed black people became a crucial factor in the dred scott case. as scott attempted to become an american citizen with all its inalienable rights that include owning a gun, the court ruled that ""a negro, whose ancestors were imported into this country, and sold as slaves,"" were not ""intended to be included in the general words used in [the constitution].”

following the civil war, when black people attempted to arm themselves against white supremacists, southern state governments passed so-called black codes barring them from owning guns.

throughout the 1960s, the black panthers chose to open carry in california as a sign to police that they would no longer endure racial attacks. in 1967, 30 black panthers protested on the steps of the california state house armed with shotguns and pistols. they announced that “the time has come for black people to arm themselves.” the move frightened politicians, and it wasn’t long before then-gov. ronald reagan signed a state ban on open carry into law, called the mulford act.

whitney davis of houston admits that learning more about black history is the reason why she recently purchased two guns for herself. “i realize in this country a long time ago, black people weren't even allowed to own guns,” she said.

davis’s dad grew up on a ranch in rural texas, where over his lifetime he accrued a lot of guns, but it wasn’t until davis learned more about her black ancestors that she felt motivated to buy guns of her own. “so just like people promote that our ancestors died for us to vote, they also died for us to be able to carry guns as well,” she said. “so i wanted to fulfill what my ancestors weren’t able to do in the past.”

davis endorses a common rationale voiced by proponents of easing restrictions on guns. “if everybody knows that everybody has a gun then maybe you’re a lot of less likely to attack people or hurt people,” she said. “if everyone knows, if you have a gun, i got one too, it’s an equal playing field.”

despite the increase in black gun ownership and general knowledge about black history, many black people have still lost their lives over owning a gun. “in 2016, legal gun owner philando castile was shot after informing a minnesota police officer that he was armed,” huffpost’s julia craven wrote. “two years prior, tamir rice was killed by cleveland police while holding a toy gun. john crawford suffered the same fate in a beavercreek, ohio, walmart.”

on july 25, garrett foster, a white man, attended a black lives matter protest in austin, texas, carrying a semi-automatic rifle. after a confrontation with a motorist, foster was shot dead on july 25.

the move for african-americans to own guns appears to be a break from the progressive movement in american politics, which people of color generally align with.

a view of washington, d.c., following the 1968 riots. (getty images)

the congressional black caucus has pushed for stricter gun control measures in the past, most recently following two mass shootings in el paso, texas, and dayton, ohio. “we have worked vigorously with house democrats to pass universal background check legislation,” rep. karen bass, d-calif., chair of the congressional black caucus, said in the aftermath of those two tragedies. the lawmaker said the cbc has also backed a bill to ban a loophole in gun control law introduced by majority whip jim clyburn, d-s.c. rep. bass did not return yahoo news’ request for comment.

but republicans have been consistently resistant to increased gun control measures. in response to the cbc’s push, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said congress was “in a holding pattern” on gun control.

“i still await guidance from the white house as to what [trump] thinks he’s comfortable signing,” the kentucky republican said last september. “if and when that happens, then we’ll have a real possibility of actually changing the law and hopefully making some progress.”

maj toure, founder of black guns matter, a nonprofit that educates people in urban communities on their second amendment rights through firearms training and education, believes the more black people who have guns, the better race relations will be in america. “if everyone has the right mindset with a gun, that solves race issues,” toure told yahoo news in a phone interview. “an armed society is a polite society.”

toure advocates for black gun ownership as a tool for self-defense and pushes gun safety. but he acknowledges the fact that fear makes people buy things. toure welcomes this.

“i love that so many black people are buying guns,” he said. “if you’re racist ... and you think that one group is inferior to another, then you should be afraid.”

Homeland Security Is Quietly Tying Antifa to Foreign Powers,241,i3il30,https://www.thenation.com/article/society/dhs-antifa-syria/tnamp/?__twitter_impression=true,69,1596573604.0,,"department of homeland security intelligence officials are targeting activists it considers antifa and attempting to tie them to a foreign power, according to a dhs intelligence report obtained exclusively by the nation.

the intelligence report, titled “the syrian conflict and its nexus to the u.s.-based antifascist movement,” mentions several americans, including a left-wing podcast host who traveled to syria to fight isis. the report includes these individuals’ personal information, including their social security numbers, home addresses, and social media accounts, much of the data generated by the dhs’s tactical terrorism response teams. as the intelligence report states, “antifa is being analyzed under the 2019 dhs strategic framework for countering terrorism (ct) and targeted violence.”

dated july 14, the document, marked for official use only and law enforcement sensitive, draws on a blend of publicly available information and state and federal law enforcement intelligence. it was provided to the nation by a source who previously worked on dhs intelligence.

“they targeted americans like they’re al qaeda,” a former senior dhs intelligence officer with knowledge of the operations told the nation. the officer, who served for years in the dhs’s office of intelligence and analysis (i&a), compared the operations to the illegal surveillance of activists during the civil rights era. “they essentially were violating people’s rights like this was the ’60s…the type of shit the church and pike committee[s] had to address.”

while the law generally prohibits intelligence agencies from spying on us residents, many of those protections do not apply if the individual is believed to be acting as an agent of a foreign power.

“designating someone as foreign-sponsored can make a huge legal and practical difference in the government’s ability to pursue them,” explained steven aftergood, who heads the project on government secrecy at the federation of american scientists. “it’s a crucial distinction. once someone (or some group) is identified as an agent of a foreign power, they are subject to warrantless search and surveillance in a way that would be illegal and unconstitutional for any other us person. the whole apparatus of us intelligence can be brought to bear on someone who is considered an agent of a foreign power.”

last week the dhs reassigned its intelligence chief after the washington post revealed that the agency had been compiling intelligence reports on american journalists and activists in portland, ore. in response to president trump’s executive order to protect monuments and other federal property, the dhs created the protecting american communities task force, which sent dhs assets to portland and other cities. the agency has found itself in transition under the trump administration.“they are always pressuring i&a for political reasons. it’s been like that since the election,” the former intelligence officer said.

this weekend, politico reported that dhs deputy secretary ken cuccinelli loosened oversight of i&a. cuccinelli, at i&a’s request, curtailed the requirement that the dhs’s office of civil rights and civil liberties approve i&a’s intelligence products before distribution to law enforcement partners.

the intelligence report’s executive summary states:

in june 2020, u.s. customs and border protection’s (cbp) national targeting center (ntc) counter network division (cnd) compiled cbp encounter data on individuals who returned from syria and fought with the yekîneyên parastina gel (ypg, translation: people’s protection units), and had some with reported ties to a u.s.-based antifa (anti-fascist) movement. cbp concerns about and interest in these individuals stem from the types of skills and motivations that may have developed during their time overseas in foreign conflicts.

these skills were also appreciated by the us military, which cooperated with the ypg in fighting isis for years. last year trump enraged many in the us military when he green-lit a turkish offensive against the kurdish militia. jim mattis reportedly resigned as defense secretary in part because of what he considered a betrayal of our kurdish allies.

the intelligence report describes over half a dozen people who traveled to syria in order to fight alongside kurdish factions—usually the ypg but also other kurdish groups like the pkk and the peshmerga. some of the individuals described have denied membership in antifa but variously identified with far-left causes. the dhs appears to define antifa broadly to encompass various left-wing tendencies: “antifa is driven by a mixed range of far-left political ideologies, including anti-capitalism, communism, socialism, and anarchism.” in two cases, evidence of antifa affiliation was limited to photos taken in front of an antifa flag. as the intelligence report notes, “antifa claims no official leadership,” raising questions about whether antifa even exists in any sort of operational capacity.

the first individual mentioned in the intelligence report, brace belden, cohosts the popular left-wing podcast trueanon and fought with the ypg in 2016. the report appears to be partly drawn from a 2017 article on belden in rolling stone, and describes him as “a minor criminal and drug addict who started reading marx and lenin in drug rehabilitation treatment and became involved in a number of political causes before deciding to fight alongside the ypg.”

the report says of an encounter between belden and border authorities:

u.s. citizen (usc) brace belden was encountered on 08 april 2017, arriving in san francisco, california from frankfurt, germany. belden was returning from a six month tour of volunteering to fight with the ypg under the umbrella of the syrian democrat forces (sdf) fighting isis in syria as part of the ongoing raqqa offensive starting in november 2016 to retake raqqa from isis. belden stated he recently learned that an open source article had been written about him and his “anarchist” fighters.

belden scoffed at the association. “i am not now, nor have i ever been a member of any antifa organization,” he told the nation. “the us government has been spying on and smearing communists for 100 years, but they usually have the decency not to call a red an anarchist.”

“there appears to be a clear connection…between antifa ideology and kurdish democratic federalism teachings and ideology,” the intelligence report states. at least one of the activists listed is described as ethnically kurdish.

on may 31, trump vowed to designate antifa a terrorist organization. while antifa groups have engaged in acts of property destruction, antifa has not been linked to a single killing in the united states, according to data compiled in the past 25 years by the center for strategic and international studies. by contrast, the same data found that far-right extremist groups killed 329 people.

the intelligence report appears to conclude that the individuals described were not acting on behalf of a foreign group—save for one unnamed person.

“aside from a single instance derived from open-source reporting, there does not appear to be evidence of a centralized effort to give marching orders to returning antifa-affiliated usper [us person] foreign fighters once they return to the united states.”

washington (ap) — the trump administration on tuesday announced more than $35 million in justice department grants to organizations that provide safe housing for victims of human trafficking .

attorney general william barr and presidential adviser ivanka trump announced the awards at a white house event attended by human trafficking victims and organizations that serve them.

barr called human trafficking an “evil scourge,” and he thanked president donald trump and his daughter ivanka for working to end human trafficking and help survivors. beyond the financial support, barr said his department will do everything possible to “investigate, prosecute and punish” traffickers.

ivanka trump called human trafficking the “gravest of human rights violations.” she said the event was a “celebration” of the work by the administration and the participants to confront trafficking, as well as an opportunity to hear victims tell their personal stories.

later in the program, barr became emotional and partly covered his face with a hand as those stories were being told.

the $35 million in housing assistance grants for victims of human trafficking is being provided by the office for victims of crime within the justice department’s office of justice programs to provide housing and services to human trafficking survivors.

the grants will be shared by 73 organizations in 33 states to provide anywhere from six to 24 months of transitional or short-term housing assistance to survivors, including to pay rent, utilities or related expenses, such as a security deposit, the white house said.

the money can also be used to help victims find permanent housing, get a job and receive occupational training and counseling.

ivanka trump said the coronavirus pandemic has made safe and supportive housing for survivors more important than ever. she said many survivors had to live with their traffickers during stay-at-home orders around the country.

among organizations sharing the grants are camillus house inc. in miami, alternatives for girls in detroit and the jordan community resource center in shaker heights, ohio.

president trump has sought to elevate the fight against human trafficking since taking office. in january, he appointed a special adviser for the issue."

‘Sobering’ report shows hardening attitudes against media,239,i3uttm,https://apnews.com/4d27d2b01e6e4bb3c9dd2050e5afd70e,106,1596614415.0,[deleted],"new york (ap) — the distrust many americans feel toward the news media, caught up like much of the nation’s problems in the partisan divide, only seems to be getting worse.

that was the conclusion of a “sobering” study of attitudes toward the press conducted by knight foundation and gallup and released tuesday.

nearly half of all americans describe the news media as “very biased,” the survey found.

“that’s a bad thing for democracy,” said john sands, director of learning and impact at the knight foundation. “our concern is that when half of americans have some sort of doubt about the veracity of the news they consume, it’s going to be impossible for our democracy to function.”

advertisement

the study was conducted before the coronavirus lockdown and nationwide protests over the death of george floyd.

eight percent of respondents — the preponderance of them politically conservative — think that news media that they distrust are trying to ruin the country.

the study found that 71% of republicans have a “very” or “somewhat” unfavorable opinion of the news media, while 22% of democrats feel the same way. switch it around, and 54% of democrats have a very favorable view of the media, and only 13% of republicans feel the same way.

that divide has been documented before but only seems to be deepening, particularly among conservatives, sands said.

“we’re starting to see more retrenchment among those who have already expressed deep concerns,” he said. “moving the dial on these attitudes becomes more and more difficult for media organizations.”

the study doesn’t attempt to assign blame for these attitudes. president donald trump has constantly labeled journalism he doesn’t like “fake news.” cable news networks fox news channel, msnbc and cnn feature evening opinion shows that are an increasingly popular pasttime for viewers.

who is to blame for the nation’s political divide? well, 48% of those questioned says the media bears a great deal of the responsibility.

the study found 73% of americans feel that too much bias in news reports is a major problem, up from 65% two years ago.

those surveyed also didn’t believe much in honest mistakes. when there were inaccuracies in articles, 54% of americans said they believed reporters misrepresented facts, while 28% said reporters were making things up in their entirety.

the picture isn’t much prettier when you take a step back. knight and gallup said 41% of americans have a great deal of confidence in the ability of the media to report the news fairly, down from 55% in a similar survey in 1999.

advertisement

eight in 10 americans are calling for more diversity in news. democrats and black people are more likely to be referring to racial and ethnic diversity; while republicans and white people prioritize diversity in political views.

in a clear message to facebook and twitter, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said social media companies have to work harder to remove hateful language and inaccuracies from their platforms.

knight and gallup conducted a random sample of 20,046 american adults between nov. 8, 2019 and feb. 16, 2020, and claimed a margin of error of plus or minus 1%."
Seattle Police Chief Urges City Council to Stop Protestors’ Intimidation Tactics after Group Visits Her Home,42,i3wcwt,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/seattle-police-chief-urges-city-council-to-stop-protestors-intimidation-tactics-after-group-visits-her-home/,43,1596620407.0,[deleted],"seattle police chief carmen best speaks as protesters gather outside the seattle office of emergency management to protest against police brutality and the death of george floyd, in seattle, wash., june 2, 2020. (lindsey wasson/reuters)

seattle police chief carmen best is urging the city council to take a stand against protestors intimidating public officials and employees after “a large group of aggressive protestors” visited her home on sunday night.

“i urge both of you, and the entire council, to stand up for what is right,” best wrote monday in a letter addressed to the council’s president lorena gonzález and public safety chair lisa herbold. “these direct actions against elected officials, and especially civil servants like myself, are out of line with and go against every democratic principle that guides our nation.”

“before this devolves into the new way of doing business by mob rule here in seattle, and across the nation, elected officials like you must forcefully call for the end of these tactics,” she added.

best’s neighbors were able to stop the protestors from trespassing or engaging in other illegal activity at her snohomish county residence, the letter said.

“the events of this summer were initiated in a moment of grief and outrage over the murder of george floyd by minneapolis police officers and so many other black and brown people suffering at the hands of injustice,” best said. “all of us must ensure that this righteous cause is not lost in the confusion of so many protestors now engaging in violence and intimidation, which many are not speaking against.”

in july, nearly 2,000 protestors swarmed seattle mayor jenny durkan’s home despite her address being protected by state law confidentiality as a result of her work as a u.s. attorney dealing with drug cartels, the daily caller reported.

advertisement

the mayor had called for a full council investigation of councilmember kshama sawant who durkan said acted “with reckless disregard for the safety of her family” in attending a march and rally in the mayor’s neighborhood.

protests in the city have led the mayor to propose $20 million in cuts to the police department budget in addition to the city council’s 39 amendments that would lay off 32% of employees at the department, according to local outlet komo.

the council has also proposed creating a civilian-led violence prevention unit to replace the police for a majority of calls the department currently handles.

Trump encourages mail voting in Florida but sues in Nevada,490,i46ep0,https://apnews.com/19ade6dafb5b6f82f324e4be9b12a7a0,151,1596666838.0,,"president donald trump speaks during a signing ceremony for h.r. 1957 – ""the great american outdoors act,"" in the east room of the white house, tuesday, aug. 4, 2020, in washington.

washington (ap) — in an abrupt reversal, president donald trump is encouraging voters in the critical swing state of florida to vote by mail after months of criticizing the practice — and while his campaign and the gop challenge nevada over its new vote-by-mail law.

democratic requests to vote by mail have surged in florida, a state that trump almost certainly must win to secure a second term. democrats currently have about 1.9 million floridians signed up to vote by mail this november, almost 600,000 more than the republicans’ 1.3 million, according to the florida secretary of state.

advertisement

in 2016, both sides had about 1.3 million signed up before the general election.

“whether you call it vote by mail or absentee voting, in florida the election system is safe and secure, tried and true,” trump tweeted tuesday. “florida’s voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated democrats attempts at change), so in florida i encourage all to request a ballot & vote by mail!”

white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany rejected the notion that the republican president has changed his views. she said trump supports absentee voting by mail for a reason, as opposed to states mailing out ballots to all voters regardless of whether they requested them. most election officials say there is little effective difference between absentee voting and voting by mail.

trump elaborated tuesday on why he supports voting by mail in florida but not elsewhere.

“they’ve been doing this over many years, and they’ve made it really terrific,” he said during a news conference.

“this took years to do,” he added. “this doesn’t take weeks or months. in the case of nevada, they’re going to be voting in a matter of weeks. and you can’t do that.”

nevada officials joined several states that plan on automatically sending voters mail ballots. two states, california and vermont, moved earlier this summer to adopt automatic mail ballot policies.

with the bill passed by lawmakers on sunday, nevada gov. steve sisolak, a democrat, signed it into law on monday. in a tweet trump called the bill’s passage “an illegal late night coup” and accused sisolak of exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to ensure votes would favor democrats.

making good on trump’s threat of legal action, his campaign and the national and state gop filed suit tuesday in u.s. district court in nevada against the secretary of state to stop the plan. contending the new law would undermine the election’s integrity, the suit included the argument that nevada would violate federal and constitutional law by requiring election officials to accept and count ballots received after election day even when those ballots lacked objective evidence that they were cast on or before that day.

trump’s praise of its voting aside, florida hardly has a history of flawless elections, most notably in 2000, when the state’s disputed vote count had to be resolved by the u.s. supreme court, delivering the presidency to republican george w. bush over democrat al gore.

trump cited a new york race as an example of what can go wrong, claiming no one could know the winner. in that race, a judge ruled monday that about 1,000 disputed ballots should be counted . that will likely not affect the outcome since the incumbent, longtime democratic rep. carolyn maloney, is leading her closest challenger by about 3,700 votes.

“i think they have to do the election over,” trump said. “that election is no good.”

more voters during this year’s primary elections opted to vote by mail, and several states relaxed restrictions for voting absentee through the mail. trump himself voted by mail in the florida primary this year.

five states have relied on mail-in ballots since even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person, but there is no evidence to support trump’s assertion that voting by mail leads to widespread fraud.

trump has gone so far as to suggest by tweet that the november election should be delayed “until people can properly, securely and safely vote.”

states that use mail-in votes exclusively say they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure that a hostile foreign actor doesn’t disrupt the vote. election security experts say voter fraud is rare in all forms of balloting, including by mail.

with florida’s large retirement population, voting by mail is expected to become a more popular option this november. sen. marco rubio, r-fla., was asked saturday if he had concerns about the option. “no, i’m not concerned about mail-in voting in florida,” he said tersely.

florida gop officials welcomed trump’s tweet.

“thank you for the clarification mr president! this is very helpful,” said joe gruters, the chair of florida’s republican party. “florida will deliver you the 29 electoral votes!”

florida’s presidential contests are usually close, with trump winning by just 1.2 percentage points in 2016 and george w. bush winning by just 537 votes in 2000.

Communist China and the Free World’s Future - United States Department of State,1,i4fnx0,https://www.state.gov/communist-china-and-the-free-worlds-future/,3,1596696316.0,,"governor wilson: well, thank you very much, chris. most generous. i’m not sure your grandfather would have recognized me.

i have the great pleasure – in addition to welcoming all of you to the nixon birthplace and library, i have the great pleasure of introducing to you an extraordinary american who is here at an extraordinary time. but the fun of it is in introducing our honored guest, i also am welcoming him not just to the nixon library, but i’m welcoming him back home to orange county. (applause.) that’s right. mike pompeo was born in orange. (applause.)

he attended los amigos high school in fountain valley, where he was an outstanding student and athlete. in fact, i have it on good authority that among the fans of glory days of lobo basketball, a reverent hush descends upon the crowd whenever the name “pompeo” is mentioned. (laughter.)

the secretary was first in his class at west point. he won the award as the most distinguished cadet. he won another award for the highest achievement in engineering management. he spent his active duty years, his army years, in west germany, and as he put it, patrolling the iron curtain before the fall of the berlin wall.

in 1988 – excuse me – retiring with a rank of captain, he went on to harvard law school, where he was an editor of the law review. in 1988, he returned to his mother’s home state of kansas and began a stunningly successful business career. he was elected to the house of representatives from kansas in 2011, where he soon gained great respect for a reputation as one of the most diligent and astute members of the house arms – excuse me, the house intelligence committee.

in 2017, president trump nominated him to be the director of central intelligence. and in 2018, he was confirmed as our 70th secretary of state.

you have to admit, that’s quite an impressive resume. so it’s sad there’s only one thing missing, prevents it from being perfect. if only mike had been a marine. (laughter.) don’t worry, he’ll get even.

mike pompeo is a man devoted to his family. he is a man of faith, of the greatest patriotism and the highest principle. one of his most important initiatives at the state department has been the creation of a commission on unalienable rights where academicians, philosophers, and ethicists advise him on human rights grounded in america’s founding principles and the principles of the 1948 universal declaration of rights.

he is here today for a very special reason. the epitaph on president nixon’s gravestone is a sentence from his first inaugural address. it says, quote, “the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker.” richard nixon received that title. he won that honor not only because he was acknowledged even by his critics to be a brilliant foreign policy strategist, but it was far more because he earned it. he learned as congressman, senator, president, and every day thereafter as a private citizen ambassador that peace is not achieved by signing documents and declaring the job done. to the contrary, he knew that peace is always a work in progress. he knew that peace must be fought for and won anew in every generation.

it was president nixon’s vision, determination, and courage that opened china to america and to the western world. as president and for the rest of his life, richard nixon worked to build a relationship with china based upon mutual benefits and obligations that respected america’s bedrock national interests.

today, we in america are obliged to assess whether or not president nixon’s labors and his hopes for such a relationship have been met or whether they are being undermined.

that is why it is of such great significance that our honored guest, secretary pompeo, has chosen the nixon library from which to deliver a major china policy statement. it will, i promise you, be a statement of complete clarity delivered with force and with belief because it is of critical importance.

ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor and pleasure to welcome to this podium and to this audience our honored guest, the secretary of state of the united states of america, the honorable and really quite remarkable – honorable michael r. pompeo. (applause.)

secretary pompeo: thank you. thank you all. thank you, governor, for that very, very generous introduction. it is true: when you walk in that gym and you say the name “pompeo,” there is a whisper. i had a brother, mark, who was really good – a really good basketball player.

and how about another round of applause for the blue eagles honor guard and senior airman kayla highsmith, and her wonderful rendition of the national anthem? (applause.)

thank you, too, to pastor laurie for that moving prayer, and i want to thank hugh hewitt and the nixon foundation for your invitation to speak at this important american institution. it was great to be sung to by an air force person, introduced by a marine, and they let the army guy in in front of the navy guy’s house. (laughter.) it’s all good.

it’s an honor to be here in yorba linda, where nixon’s father built the house in which he was born and raised.

to all the nixon center board and staff who made today possible – it’s difficult in these times – thanks for making this day possible for me and for my team.

we are blessed to have some incredibly special people in the audience, including chris, who i’ve gotten to know – chris nixon. i also want to thank tricia nixon and julie nixon eisenhower for their support of this visit as well.

i want to recognize several courageous chinese dissidents who have joined us here today and made a long trip.

and to all the other distinguished guests – (applause) – to all the other distinguished guests, thank you for being here. for those of you who got under the tent, you must have paid extra.

and those of you watching live, thank you for tuning in.

and finally, as the governor mentioned, i was born here in santa ana, not very far from here. i’ve got my sister and her husband in the audience today. thank you all for coming out. i bet you never thought that i’d be standing up here.

my remarks today are the fourth set of remarks in a series of china speeches that i asked national security advisor robert o’brien, fbi director chris wray, and the attorney general barr to deliver alongside me.

we had a very clear purpose, a real mission. it was to explain the different facets of america’s relationship with china, the massive imbalances in that relationship that have built up over decades, and the chinese communist party’s designs for hegemony.

our goal was to make clear that the threats to americans that president trump’s china policy aims to address are clear and our strategy for securing those freedoms established.

ambassador o’brien spoke about ideology. fbi director wray talked about espionage. attorney general barr spoke about economics. and now my goal today is to put it all together for the american people and detail what the china threat means for our economy, for our liberty, and indeed for the future of free democracies around the world.

next year marks half a century since dr. kissinger’s secret mission to china, and the 50th anniversary of president nixon’s trip isn’t too far away in 2022.

the world was much different then.

we imagined engagement with china would produce a future with bright promise of comity and cooperation.

but today – today we’re all still wearing masks and watching the pandemic’s body count rise because the ccp failed in its promises to the world. we’re reading every morning new headlines of repression in hong kong and in xinjiang.

we’re seeing staggering statistics of chinese trade abuses that cost american jobs and strike enormous blows to the economies all across america, including here in southern california. and we’re watching a chinese military that grows stronger and stronger, and indeed more menacing.

i’ll echo the questions ringing in the hearts and minds of americans from here in california to my home state of kansas and beyond:

what do the american people have to show now 50 years on from engagement with china?

did the theories of our leaders that proposed a chinese evolution towards freedom and democracy prove to be true?

is this china’s definition of a win-win situation?

and indeed, centrally, from the secretary of state’s perspective, is america safer? do we have a greater likelihood of peace for ourselves and peace for the generations which will follow us?

look, we have to admit a hard truth. we must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come, that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the chinese century of which xi jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with china simply won’t get it done. we must not continue it and we must not return to it.

as president trump has made very clear, we need a strategy that protects the american economy, and indeed our way of life. the free world must triumph over this new tyranny.

now, before i seem too eager to tear down president nixon’s legacy, i want to be clear that he did what he believed was best for the american people at the time, and he may well have been right.

he was a brilliant student of china, a fierce cold warrior, and a tremendous admirer of the chinese people, just as i think we all are.

he deserves enormous credit for realizing that china was too important to be ignored, even when the nation was weakened because of its own self-inflicted communist brutality.

in 1967, in a very famous foreign affairs article, nixon explained his future strategy. here’s what he said:

he said, “taking the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave china forever outside of the family of nations…the world cannot be safe until china changes. thus, our aim – to the extent we can, we must influence events. our goal should be to induce change.”

and i think that’s the key phrase from the entire article: “to induce change.”

so, with that historic trip to beijing, president nixon kicked off our engagement strategy. he nobly sought a freer and safer world, and he hoped that the chinese communist party would return that commitment.

as time went on, american policymakers increasingly presumed that as china became more prosperous, it would open up, it would become freer at home, and indeed present less of a threat abroad, it’d be friendlier. it all seemed, i am sure, so inevitable.

but that age of inevitability is over. the kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change inside of china that president nixon had hoped to induce.

the truth is that our policies – and those of other free nations – resurrected china’s failing economy, only to see beijing bite the international hands that were feeding it.

we opened our arms to chinese citizens, only to see the chinese communist party exploit our free and open society. china sent propagandists into our press conferences, our research centers, our high-schools, our colleges, and even into our pta meetings.

we marginalized our friends in taiwan, which later blossomed into a vigorous democracy.

we gave the chinese communist party and the regime itself special economic treatment, only to see the ccp insist on silence over its human rights abuses as the price of admission for western companies entering china.

ambassador o’brien ticked off a few examples just the other day: marriott, american airlines, delta, united all removed references to taiwan from their corporate websites, so as not to anger beijing.

in hollywood, not too far from here – the epicenter of american creative freedom, and self-appointed arbiters of social justice – self-censors even the most mildly unfavorable reference to china.

this corporate acquiescence to the ccp happens all over the world, too.

and how has this corporate fealty worked? is its flattery rewarded? i’ll give you a quote from the speech that general barr gave, attorney general barr. in a speech last week, he said that “the ultimate ambition of china’s rulers isn’t to trade with the united states. it is to raid the united states.”

china ripped off our prized intellectual property and trade secrets, causing [1] millions of jobs all across america.

it sucked supply chains away from america, and then added a widget made of slave labor.

it made the world’s key waterways less safe for international commerce.

president nixon once said he feared he had created a “frankenstein” by opening the world to the ccp, and here we are.

now, people of good faith can debate why free nations allowed these bad things to happen for all these years. perhaps we were naive about china’s virulent strain of communism, or triumphalist after our victory in the cold war, or cravenly capitalist, or hoodwinked by beijing’s talk of a “peaceful rise.”

whatever the reason – whatever the reason, today china is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom everywhere else.

and president trump has said: enough.

i don’t think many people on either side of the aisle dispute the facts that i have laid out today. but even now, some are insisting that we preserve the model of dialogue for dialogue’s sake.

now, to be clear, we’ll keep on talking. but the conversations are different these days. i traveled to honolulu now just a few weeks back to meet with yang jiechi.

it was the same old story – plenty of words, but literally no offer to change any of the behaviors.

yang’s promises, like so many the ccp made before him, were empty. his expectations, i surmise, were that i’d cave to their demands, because frankly this is what too many prior administrations have done. i didn’t, and president trump will not either.

as ambassador o’brien explained so well, we have to keep in mind that the ccp regime is a marxist-leninist regime. general secretary xi jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology.

it’s this ideology, it’s this ideology that informs his decades-long desire for global hegemony of chinese communism. america can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries, just as the ccp has never ignored them.

my experience in the house intelligence committee, and then as director of the central intelligence agency, and my now two-plus years as america’s secretary of state have led me to this central understanding:

that the only way – the only way to truly change communist china is to act not on the basis of what chinese leaders say, but how they behave. and you can see american policy responding to this conclusion. president reagan said that he dealt with the soviet union on the basis of “trust but verify.” when it comes to the ccp, i say we must distrust and verify. (applause.)

we, the freedom-loving nations of the world, must induce china to change, just as president nixon wanted. we must induce china to change in more creative and assertive ways, because beijing’s actions threaten our people and our prosperity.

we must start by changing how our people and our partners perceive the chinese communist party. we have to tell the truth. we can’t treat this incarnation of china as a normal country, just like any other.

we know that trading with china is not like trading with a normal, law-abiding nation. beijing threatens international agreements as – treats international suggestions as – or agreements as suggestions, as conduits for global dominance.

but by insisting on fair terms, as our trade representative did when he secured our phase one trade deal, we can force china to reckon with its intellectual property theft and policies that harmed american workers.

we know too that doing business with a ccp-backed company is not the same as doing business with, say, a canadian company. they don’t answer to independent boards, and many of them are state-sponsored and so have no need to pursue profits.

a good example is huawei. we stopped pretending huawei is an innocent telecommunications company that’s just showing up to make sure you can talk to your friends. we’ve called it what it is – a true national security threat – and we’ve taken action accordingly.

we know too that if our companies invest in china, they may wittingly or unwittingly support the communist party’s gross human rights violations.

our departments of treasury and commerce have thus sanctioned and blacklisted chinese leaders and entities that are harming and abusing the most basic rights for people all across the world. several agencies have worked together on a business advisory to make certain our ceos are informed of how their supply chains are behaving inside of china.

we know too, we know too that not all chinese students and employees are just normal students and workers that are coming here to make a little bit of money and to garner themselves some knowledge. too many of them come here to steal our intellectual property and to take this back to their country.

the department of justice and other agencies have vigorously pursued punishment for these crimes.

we know that the people’s liberation army is not a normal army, too. its purpose is to uphold the absolute rule of the chinese communist party elites and expand a chinese empire, not to protect the chinese people.

and so our department of defense has ramped up its efforts, freedom of navigation operations out and throughout the east and south china seas, and in the taiwan strait as well. and we’ve created a space force to help deter china from aggression on that final frontier.

and so too, frankly, we’ve built out a new set of policies at the state department dealing with china, pushing president trump’s goals for fairness and reciprocity, to rewrite the imbalances that have grown over decades.

just this week, we announced the closure of the chinese consulate in houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. (applause.)

we reversed, two weeks ago, eight years of cheek-turning with respect to international law in the south china sea.

we’ve called on china to conform its nuclear capabilities to the strategic realities of our time.

and the state department – at every level, all across the world – has engaged with our chinese counterparts simply to demand fairness and reciprocity.

but our approach can’t just be about getting tough. that’s unlikely to achieve the outcome that we desire. we must also engage and empower the chinese people – a dynamic, freedom-loving people who are completely distinct from the chinese communist party.

that begins with in-person diplomacy. (applause.) i’ve met chinese men and women of great talent and diligence wherever i go.

i’ve met with uyghurs and ethnic kazakhs who escaped xinjiang’s concentration camps. i’ve talked with hong kong’s democracy leaders, from cardinal zen to jimmy lai. two days ago in london, i met with hong kong freedom fighter nathan law.

and last month in my office, i heard the stories of tiananmen square survivors. one of them is here today.

wang dan was a key student who has never stopped fighting for freedom for the chinese people. mr. wang, will you please stand so that we may recognize you? (applause.)

also with us today is the father of the chinese democracy movement, wei jingsheng. he spent decades in chinese labor camps for his advocacy. mr. wei, will you please stand? (applause.)

i grew up and served my time in the army during the cold war. and if there is one thing i learned, communists almost always lie. the biggest lie that they tell is to think that they speak for 1.4 billion people who are surveilled, oppressed, and scared to speak out.

quite the contrary. the ccp fears the chinese people’s honest opinions more than any foe, and save for losing their own grip on power, they have reason – no reason to.

just think how much better off the world would be – not to mention the people inside of china – if we had been able to hear from the doctors in wuhan and they’d been allowed to raise the alarm about the outbreak of a new and novel virus.

for too many decades, our leaders have ignored, downplayed the words of brave chinese dissidents who warned us about the nature of the regime we’re facing.

and we can’t ignore it any longer. they know as well as anyone that we can never go back to the status quo.

but changing the ccp’s behavior cannot be the mission of the chinese people alone. free nations have to work to defend freedom. it’s the furthest thing from easy.

but i have faith we can do it. i have faith because we’ve done it before. we know how this goes.

i have faith because the ccp is repeating some of the same mistakes that the soviet union made – alienating potential allies, breaking trust at home and abroad, rejecting property rights and predictable rule of law.

i have faith. i have faith because of the awakening i see among other nations that know we can’t go back to the past in the same way that we do here in america. i’ve heard this from brussels, to sydney, to hanoi.

and most of all, i have faith we can defend freedom because of the sweet appeal of freedom itself.

look at the hong kongers clamoring to emigrate abroad as the ccp tightens its grip on that proud city. they wave american flags.

it’s true, there are differences. unlike the soviet union, china is deeply integrated into the global economy. but beijing is more dependent on us than we are on them. (applause.)

look, i reject the notion that we’re living in an age of inevitability, that some trap is pre-ordained, that ccp supremacy is the future. our approach isn’t destined to fail because america is in decline. as i said in munich earlier this year, the free world is still winning. we just need to believe it and know it and be proud of it. people from all over the world still want to come to open societies. they come here to study, they come here to work, they come here to build a life for their families. they’re not desperate to settle in china.

it’s time. it’s great to be here today. the timing is perfect. it’s time for free nations to act. not every nation will approach china in the same way, nor should they. every nation will have to come to its own understanding of how to protect its own sovereignty, how to protect its own economic prosperity, and how to protect its ideals from the tentacles of the chinese communist party.

but i call on every leader of every nation to start by doing what america has done – to simply insist on reciprocity, to insist on transparency and accountability from the chinese communist party. it’s a cadre of rulers that are far from homogeneous.

and these simple and powerful standards will achieve a great deal. for too long we let the ccp set the terms of engagement, but no longer. free nations must set the tone. we must operate on the same principles.

we have to draw common lines in the sand that cannot be washed away by the ccp’s bargains or their blandishments. indeed, this is what the united states did recently when we rejected china’s unlawful claims in the south china sea once and for all, as we have urged countries to become clean countries so that their citizens’ private information doesn’t end up in the hand of the chinese communist party. we did it by setting standards.

now, it’s true, it’s difficult. it’s difficult for some small countries. they fear being picked off. some of them for that reason simply don’t have the ability, the courage to stand with us for the moment.

indeed, we have a nato ally of ours that hasn’t stood up in the way that it needs to with respect to hong kong because they fear beijing will restrict access to china’s market. this is the kind of timidity that will lead to historic failure, and we can’t repeat it.

we cannot repeat the mistakes of these past years. the challenge of china demands exertion, energy from democracies – those in europe, those in africa, those in south america, and especially those in the indo-pacific region.

and if we don’t act now, ultimately the ccp will erode our freedoms and subvert the rules-based order that our societies have worked so hard to build. if we bend the knee now, our children’s children may be at the mercy of the chinese communist party, whose actions are the primary challenge today in the free world.

general secretary xi is not destined to tyrannize inside and outside of china forever, unless we allow it.

now, this isn’t about containment. don’t buy that. it’s about a complex new challenge that we’ve never faced before. the ussr was closed off from the free world. communist china is already within our borders.

so we can’t face this challenge alone. the united nations, nato, the g7 countries, the g20, our combined economic, diplomatic, and military power is surely enough to meet this challenge if we direct it clearly and with great courage.

maybe it’s time for a new grouping of like-minded nations, a new alliance of democracies.

we have the tools. i know we can do it. now we need the will. to quote scripture, i ask is “our spirit willing but our flesh weak?”

if the free world doesn’t change – doesn’t change, communist china will surely change us. there can’t be a return to the past practices because they’re comfortable or because they’re convenient.

securing our freedoms from the chinese communist party is the mission of our time, and america is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.

as i explained in philadelphia last week, standing, staring at independence hall, our nation was founded on the premise that all human beings possess certain rights that are unalienable.

and it’s our government’s job to secure those rights. it is a simple and powerful truth. it’s made us a beacon of freedom for people all around the world, including people inside of china.

indeed, richard nixon was right when he wrote in 1967 that “the world cannot be safe until china changes.” now it’s up to us to heed his words.

today the danger is clear.

and today the awakening is happening.

today the free world must respond.

we can never go back to the past.

may god bless each of you.

may god bless the chinese people.

and may god bless the people of the united states of america.

thank you all.

(applause.)

mr hewitt: thank you, mr. secretary. please be seated. i’m hugh hewitt, the president of the library, and secretary pompeo graciously invited some questions as i was listening. thank you for joining us, mr. secretary, at the nixon library.

my first question has to do with the context of the president’s visit in 1972. you mentioned the soviet union was isolated, but it was dangerous. he went to the people’s republic of china in 1972 to try and ally and combine interests with them against the soviet union; it was successful.

does russia present an opportunity now to the united states to coax them into the battle to be relentlessly candid about the chinese communist party?

secretary pompeo: so i do think there’s that opportunity. that opportunity is born of the relationship, the natural relationship between russia and china, and we can do something as well. there are places where we need to work with russia. today – or tomorrow, i guess it is, our teams will be on the ground with the russians working on a strategic dialogue to hopefully create the next generation of arms control agreements like reagan did. it’s in our interest, it’s in russia’s interest. we’ve asked the chinese to participate. they’ve declined to date. we hope they’ll change their mind.

it’s these kind of things – these proliferation issues, these big strategic challenges – that if we work alongside russia, i’m convinced we can make the world safer. and so there – i think there is a place for us to work with the russians to achieve a more likely outcome of peace not only for the united states but for the world.

mr hewitt: president nixon also put quite a lot of store in personal relationships over many years with individuals. that can lead wrong. president bush famously misjudged vladimir putin and said so afterwards. you have met president xi often. is the general secretary of the chinese communist party someone with whom we can deal on a transparent and reliable basis, in your opinion, based on your personal diplomacy with him?

secretary pompeo: so the meetings that i’ve had and the meeting that the president – we’ve had – they’ve been good, frank conversations. he is the most powerful leader of china since mao. he has also in many ways deinstitutionalized the chinese communist party, thus giving him even more capacity and more power.

but hugh, i think the way to think about it is how i spoke about this today: it’s about actions. and so how one evaluates one’s counterparts sitting across the table from them – it’s important to think about how you can find common understandings and make progress. but in the end, it’s not about what someone says or the agreement that they sign, but are they prepared to lead, to do the things that they committed to? are they prepared to fulfill their promises?

and we’ve watched – we’ve watched this china walk away from their promises to the world on hong kong, we watched their – general secretary xi promised president obama in the rose garden in 2015 that he wouldn’t militarize the south china sea. and google the south china sea and arms; you’ll see another promise broken.

so in the end, from my perspective, it’s much more important to watch how leaders behave and how they lead than what it is you think when you have a chance to talk to them on the phone or meet them in person.

mr hewitt: mr. secretary, you said this is not containment. i heard that very clearly. i have read the three previous speeches by ambassador o’brien, director wray, attorney general barr, and now listened to you very closely. it isn’t containment, but it is a fairly comprehensive, multidimensional, relentlessly objective candor. is that dangerous in a world that’s not used to speaking clearly about delicate subjects?

secretary pompeo: my experience, and i think president trump’s experience too in his life as a businessman, is the best policy is always true candor, identifying the places that you have a redline, identifying places that you have a real interest, making clear if there’s places where you don’t, and there’s things that you can work on alongside each other.

i think the real danger comes from misunderstandings and miscommunication and the failure to be honest about the things that matter to you, because others will move into that space and then conflict arises. i think the world is a heck of a lot safer when you have leaders who are prepared to be honest about the things that matter and prepared to talk about the things their nation is prepared to do to secure those interests. and you can reduce risk by these conversations so long as you’re honest about it.

so i – no, i don’t think it’s dangerous. i think it’s just the opposite of that.

mr hewitt: you also said – and i’m sure the speech will be known as the “distrust but verify” speech – when you distrust but verify, that still premises verification is possible. it is still possible to do agreements and to verify them; correct?

secretary pompeo: it is, yeah, you can still do it. each nation’s got to be prepared for a certain amount of intrusiveness connected to that. and it is not in the nature of communist regimes to allow transparency inside of their country. and so it’s been done before. we’ve had – we had arms control agreements with the soviet union that we got verification that was sufficient to ensure that we protected american interests. i believe we can do it again. i hope that we can do this on these – i mean, the chinese communist party has several hundred nuclear warheads. this is a serious global power. and to the extent we can find common ground, a common set of understandings to reduce risk that there’s ever a really bad day for the world, we ought to do it, and it’s going to require agreement and verification.

mr hewitt: ambassador richard haass, who is now chairman of the council on foreign relations, said very recently – it may have been yesterday, it might have been this morning; i saw it this morning preparing – quote, “secretary pompeo doesn’t speak of china but of the chinese communist party as if there were a china apart from the party. this is meant to antagonize and make diplomacy impossible. quite a stance for america’s chief diplomat to take unless his goal is to ensure diplomacy fails.” is that your goal?

secretary pompeo: (laughter.) ah, goodness. hard to begin. here’s where i’ll begin: it’s a bit patronizing to the people of china to make such an assertion that they are not free-thinking beings, that they’re not rational people who were given – i mean, they too were made in the image of god, right. they have all the capacity that anybody in the world does. so to somehow think that we ought to ignore the voices of the people of china seems to me the wrong approach. it is true the chinese communist party is a one-party rule. and so we will deal with the chinese communist party as the head of state for china, and we need to, and we need to engage in dialogue. but it seems to me we would dishonor ourselves and the people of china if we ignored them.

mr hewitt: now, ambassador o’brien, whose speech you referenced, put heavy emphasis on the ideology of marxist-leninism. it was almost quaint to hear that conversation again; it’s gone from our vocabulary. does the american people, and especially american media, need to reacquaint itself with what marxist-leninists believe, because the ccp genuinely does believe it?

secretary pompeo: i always get in trouble, hugh, when i comment on the media. so i’ll say this much: for those of us who have lived and seen and observed, there are other marxist-leninist nations today as well – and have seen – they believe – they have an understanding, a central understanding of how people interact and how societies ought to interact. and it is certainly the case today that the leadership in china believes that.

we should acknowledge that, and we should make sure that we don’t for a moment think that they don’t believe it. it’s what ambassador o’brien’s speech was about. it was the fact – it was acknowledging that they believe it and recognizing that we have to respond in a way that reflects our understanding of the way they view the world.

mr hewitt: let’s not talk about the american media. i want to talk about the chinese media for a moment. they are aggressive, to say the least, and right now they are aggressively defending, for example, tiktok. a small question within a large question: is tiktok capable of being weaponized? is that an example of what’s going on? and generally, chinese media has become far more aggressive than i’ve seen in 30 years since i was at the library the first time of watching it. is that something you’ve noticed as well?

secretary pompeo: yes, they’re very aggressive. two pieces to this, one you hit upon. one is i’ll describe as their technology medium. without singling out any particular business, our view of these companies is we’re neither for or against the company; we’re about making sure that we protect the information that belongs to each of you – your health records, your face if it’s a facial recognition software, your address. all the things that you care that you want to make sure the chinese communist party doesn’t have, we have a responsibility to make sure that the systems that you’re using don’t give them access to that. and so whether it’s the efforts we’ve made against huawei or the work that we’re doing on other software firms, the american task is to protect the american people and their information.

the second piece of this has to do with their – what i’ll call the state-sponsored media of china and their disinformation. you should know – and this is where i am concerned about the american media, too – these are state-sponsored media organizations that take their messaging from the chinese communist party each day. when american institutions pick up those storylines and carry them forward, they are, in fact, propagating chinese propaganda, and we all ought to be wise to that.

there was an editorial in the new york times yesterday by someone who had a clear view that was antithetical to the american way of life. the new york times ran it straight-up without comment, forwarding – although albeit in the opinion section, but propagating chinese propaganda. that is certainly not instructive when they’re telling senators from arkansas they can’t simply talk about america and american freedom in that same media outlet.

mr hewitt: you mentioned that a lot of corporate america – and you mentioned specifically hollywood – have got deep intertwinement with the chinese economy. so i don’t want to talk about soft power; i want to talk about soft appeasement. one of my favorite sports figures, lebron james, falls silent when china comes up. in the new top gun movie, the taiwan and japanese patches are taken off maverick’s jacket. they’re not going to be in top gun 2; they were in top gun 1. what do you say not to those individuals, but to everyone who has an american spotlight about their responsibility to be candid about the people’s republic of china?

secretary pompeo: here’s our ask: our ask is if you claim that you care about human rights or social justice or these things, if you make that part of your corporate theology, then you ought to be consistent. and you can’t be consistent if you’re operating there in china without talking about and acknowledging what the chinese communist party is doing in certain parts of their country – the oppression that’s taking place. look, every business leader has got to make decisions for themselves. they’ve got to be able to live with the decisions that they make. you highlighted a few.

i’d simply ask this: if you run an entity and the united states government were to tell you you couldn’t do something, put a particular symbol in your movie or put a particular name on your menu – if we were to tell you that, you’d say nope, that’s not appropriate, and it, of course, would not be appropriate. it seems to me that if you permit the chinese communist party to limit you in that way, it’s got to be difficult for you to go home at night.

mr hewitt: two more questions, mr. secretary. (applause.) because it is hot and it is warm, and everyone out here has been in the sun for a while. you’re a west point graduate, and as governor wilson noted, number one, so this might be tough for you. but we are an, like athens was, a naval power. america is a naval power. and as like sparta is, china is a land power. do we not have to change how we approach defense spending to put more emphasis on our naval resources than on our army resources?

secretary pompeo: oh, that’s tough for an army guy to say. (laughter.)

mr hewitt: i know.

secretary pompeo: you’re killing me. look, i’ll leave to secretary esper the details of this, but i can – here’s what i can say. when president trump set out our national security strategy early on in the administration, for the first time we identified china in a way that was fundamentally different than we had done – this isn’t partisan – for decades.

that was important because that was a signal to all of us, whether it’s the state department or the defense department, that we needed to reoriented our – reorient our assets. and so yes, you’ve seen the department of defense begin to do that. these are big things to turn. these budgets are multiyear. it takes a while.

but if you look at how secretary esper and president trump are positioning our military capabilities – not just the tactical, operational, and strategic capabilities, but our cyber capabilities, our space capabilities – if you look at how we’re thinking about this and spending resources in year two, three, four, and five, i think you’ll see that our focus has shifted pretty dramatically.

it’s not to say that our efforts to protect america from terrorism are behind us. we still have work to do there. but i think this great power challenge that presents itself is something that we have recognized and we begin to make sure that we allocate your money – our taxpayer resources that we have – to the appropriate ends to achieve american security.

mr hewitt: my last question has to do with a former secretary of state who was also an army man, george marshall. he gave a speech in 1947 at your alma mater, harvard, in which he called on all the nations of the world to recognize that the world was in crisis and to choose a side. and he assured them in that famous address that if you chose the american side in (inaudible) europe, you could count on america.

so as you make the appeal you did today, not just to europe, where it’s relatively easy to be outspoken, though norway has found it not to be outspoken, but to taiwan and japan and vietnam and all of the – australia, all of the nations of that region – can they rely on america in the way that people opposing the soviet union could rely on george marshall’s assurance in 1947?

secretary pompeo: undoubtedly, undoubtedly, hugh. the only thing i’ll say is when – this language of “pick a side” does make sense to me, but i think about picking a side differently than picking america or picking china. i think the sides, the division – the shirts and skins, if you will – is between freedom and tyranny. i think that’s the decision that we’re asking each of these nations to make. (applause.)

and here’s the good news of this. the good news is it does take american leadership often in these cases. to your point, they need to know that america will be there for them. i’ve seen the tide turn. in just – in just these three and half years of our administration, i’ve watched other nations have less timidity, become more prepared to stand up for their freedoms and for the freedoms of their people. we don’t ask them to do this for america. we ask them to do it for their country and for their nation – the freedom and the independence and to protect the rights of their people.

and when we do that and we tell them that america will be there, i am very confident in the end that this is a world that with the hard work applied will become one that is governed by a rules-based order, and the freedom of the american people will be secured.

mr hewitt: mr. secretary, thank you for joining us here today.

secretary pompeo: thank you.

mr hewitt: please join me in thanking the secretary. (applause.)

secretary pompeo: thank you all."
Husband of LA district attorney charged after pointing gun at Black Lives Matter protesters,46,i4jlno,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/04/husband-los-angeles-district-attorney-charged-with-pointing-a-gun-at-black-lives-matter-protesters,12,1596710605.0,[deleted],"the husband of the los angeles district attorney has been charged with multiple firearm assaults after he pointed a gun at black lives matter activists and said, “i will shoot you.”

david lacey, whose wife jackie lacey is the elected prosecutor currently running for re-election, is facing three misdemeanor charges for pointing his firearm at three organizers who were protesting outside their house on 2 march, the day before the primary election. the charges come from the state attorney general’s office.

the incident was captured on video and showed david lacey opening his door and threatening the demonstrators, saying, “get off of my porch. i will shoot you … i don’t care who you are … we’re calling the police right now.” he appeared to have his finger on the trigger.

close to the door was melina abdullah, a black lives matter los angeles leader, who said on the video: “he pulled a gun and pointed it at my chest.”

abdullah, who has been protesting against jackie lacey for years over her refusal to prosecute officers who kill civilians, told the guardian on tuesday that she was surprised to learn of the charges from the media, and said she had not had any contact with the attorney general or the district attorney.

she also pointed out that the charges were misdemeanors and that prosecutors typically file more serious felony charges for firearm threats like the one clearly captured on footage against her.

“had it been anyone else who pointed a gun at someone’s chest, at three people in fact, and said the words, ‘i will shoot you’, we know they’d be getting more than misdemeanors,” said abdullah, who is also a professor of pan-african studies at cal state la. “the system is there to protect themselves.”

samuel tyre, an attorney for david lacey, said in an email that his client was “disappointed that the attorney general’s office felt that the conduct at issue amounted to criminal behavior”, adding, “we disagree entirely with their assessment, but we have the utmost faith in the justice system, and we are confident that the correct result will be reached.”

tyre declined to comment on the specifics of the case, but added, “my client’s human instinct is forever and always to protect his wife and his family and to keep them safe from physical harm”.

lacey had promised last fall to meet with black lives matter activists who have long called for her to address police violence, but the meeting never happened, organizers said at the time. using a tactic that has become common in recent protests, a group of about 30 protesters showed up to lacey’s granada hills home in the early morning. they brought chairs with them saying they were going to hold the community meeting that they had been promised. there were no threats of violence from the demonstrators.

abdullah said it seemed the charges were meant to “placate the community”, adding, “it’s trying to give us the illusion that there is justice.”

she also said it had taken time for her to process what happened, though she has continued to be a vocal presence at the demonstrations against police violence in recent months. the incident affected her whole family, she said, noting that her children had to leave their classrooms when it happened: “it’s not only weighed on me.”

hours after the original incident, jackie lacey offered a tearful apology to reporters, saying she and her husband were frightened.

the da’s office declined to comment on tuesday and lacey’s campaign did not immediately respond to an inquiry. lacey is facing a tough re-election fight in november and has long faced criticism for her handling of killings by police, her aggressive pursuit of the death penalty and other tough-on-crime strategies."
Deutsche Bank gave Trump financial records to New York prosecutors - report,295,i4l57l,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/05/deutsche-bank-donald-trump-financial-records-new-york,22,1596717014.0,,"this article is more than 3 months old

new york prosecutors investigating donald trump’s finances previously issued a subpoena to deutsche bank, one of the foremost lenders to the president’s business, as part of their inquiry – and the bank complied, according to the new york times.

the office of the manhattan district attorney, cyrus vance, is seeking eight years of the president’s personal and corporate tax records, but has disclosed little about what prompted the prosecutor and his team to request the records beyond payoffs to women to silence them about alleged affairs with trump in the past.

lawyers for vance told a judge in new york on monday that he was justified in demanding the records from trump, citing public reports of “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the trump organization”.

prosecutor says trump investigation is broader than hush-money payoffs read more

a report emerged on wednesday that vance’s office subpoenaed the german lender last year in what the new york times said was a sign that their criminal investigation into trump’s business practices is more wide-ranging than previously known.

the report noted that this appeared to be the first instance of a criminal inquiry involving trump and his dealings with deutsche bank.

the german bank, which has been a longstanding source of financing to trump’s real estate empire, obeyed the subpoena and handed over records supplied by trump to the bank during the course of applying for loans, the report said, citing unnamed sources with knowledge of the investigation.

trump’s lawyers last month said the grand jury subpoena for the president’s tax returns was issued in bad faith and amounted to harassment.

in a court filing on monday, though, attorneys for vance said trump’s arguments that the subpoena was too broad stemmed from “the false premise” that the investigation was limited to so-called “hush-money” payments.

they said public reporting demonstrates that at the time the subpoena was issued “there were public allegations of possible criminal activity at plaintiff’s new york county-based trump organization dating back over a decade”.

they added: “these reports describe transactions involving individual and corporate actors based in new york county, but whose conduct at times extended beyond new york’s borders. this possible criminal activity occurred within the applicable statutes of limitations, particularly if the transactions involved a continuing pattern of conduct.”

vance sought the tax records in part for an investigation of how michael cohen, trump’s former fixer and now convicted felon, arranged to keep the adult film producer and actor stormy daniels and the model karen mcdougal from airing claims of extramarital affairs with trump during the 2016 presidential race. trump has denied the affairs.

on wednesday, the new york times further reported that the subpoena to deutsche bank sought any materials that might point to possible fraud and that deutsche’s cooperation contrasted with numerous other attempts to access trump’s financial records over the years that have been blocked by successful legal challenges.

other investigators have requested records from deutsche bank, which was one of the few banks willing to lend to trump after a series of corporate bankruptcies starting in the early 1990s.

two congressional committees, both controlled by democrats, subpoenaed the bank for documents related to trump, who sued to block their release.

the new york attorney general, letitia james, a democrat, also subpoenaed the bank for records related to trump last year following cohen’s testimony.

trump has said the investigations are all politically motivated. earlier this week, he called vance’s investigation “a continuation of the witch-hunt”."
Opinion: Axios interview reveals the real outrage of Trump's presidency,15,i4lo6w,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/opinions/axios-interview-trump-presidency-filipovic/index.html,4,1596719460.0,,"jill filipovic is a journalist based in new york and author of the forthcoming book ""ok boomer, let's talk: how my generation got left behind,"" and of ""the h-spot: the feminist pursuit of happiness."" follow her on twitter. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. view more opinion articles on cnn.

(cnn) president donald trump's interview with the axios reporter jonathan swan , published this week, was an abject disaster -- not for swan, who was admirably dogged and professional, but for the incoherent, appallingly ignorant president of the united states, and for all of us who live in the country he leads.

this was not trump's first failed interview. nor did it break entirely new ground in laying bare his inability to grasp basic concepts, his disregard for american lives, his narcissism and pettiness. but the interview did reveal a new set of outrageous and alarming moments from the man who, regrettably, is in charge.

asked about the legacy of john lewis, the civil rights icon and longtime georgia congressional representative, the president said , ""i don't know."" given a chance to think about it and try again, he declined.

instead he went back to his well-worn playbook: first he nursed personal grievance (""he didn't come to my inauguration""), then he bragged about an achievement he hasn't actually accomplished (""nobody has done more for black americans than i have"") and then returned to the grievance (lewis ""should have come. i think he made a big mistake by not showing up"").

he finally allowed: ""he was a person that devoted a lot of energy and a lot of heart to civil rights, but there were many others also.""

asked about america's handling of the coronavirus -- our country has 4% of the world's population but 22% percent of coronavirus deaths -- the president said: ""if you look at death ... united states is lowest in numerous categories. we're lower than the world. we're lower than europe."" this is obviously untrue, but trump brought simple, almost childlike charts showing us deaths as a proportion of total cases, which he thrust at swan as evidence.

it's hardly a victory that the united states not only has the highest number of total deaths but also extraordinarily high numbers of people who have been infected with coronavirus, the long-term health impacts of which are still unknown. when swan clarified that ""you're doing death as a proportion of cases. i'm talking about death as a proportion of population,"" trump lashed out, snapping, ""you can't do that."" but of course he could -- and as a journalist, should.

when swan emphasized that a thousand americans were dying every day from coronavirus, the president responded, ""they are dying. that's true. and it is what it is.""

then he claimed the virus was under control ""as much as you can control it.""

there is no question, at this point, that we in america have a big donald trump problem. this president is incompetent. he puts american national security at risk . he has annihilated democratic norms and the institutions that make our nation function. he is reckless with american lives . and by continuing, many months in, to so stunningly fail in his response to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, his presidency should always be mentioned alongside a heartbreaking body count.

but we also have a republican party problem, and, let's be honest, a white america problem.

trump would not be in office if his party did not support, aid and abet him. he would not have succeeded in so thoroughly obliterating the basic principles of the rule of law -- and would not have been able to avoid removal from office -- if the gop had not completely rallied around him and if so many dyed-in-the-wool republicans had not gone to work for him and implemented his agenda.

his message would not have resonated if republicans had not spent decades honing their racist southern strategy in the wake of the civil rights act of 1964, a tactic of dog-whistle racism perhaps best explained by the late republican campaign consultant lee atwater.

in 1981 atwater told political scientist alexander lamis , ""you start out in 1954 by saying, ""n-----, n-----, n-----."" by 1968 you can't say ""n-----"" -- that hurts you, backfires. so you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff, and you're getting so abstract. now, you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.... 'we want to cut this,' is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""n-----, n-----.""

trump ran to lead a party that had already accrued a base of racist whites who liked that rhetoric. and he took the longstanding strategy that atwater so bluntly laid out -- to couch racist politics in race-neutral terms -- and exaggerated it, often eliminating the subtext.

from claiming barack obama was born in kenya to telling an african american audience to vote for him since they were poor and unemployed (""what the hell do you have to lose?"") to fear-mongering about immigrants as ""rapists"" to retweeting white supremacists , trump took the pervasive but often veiled racism of many in his party and pulled back the cover.

many of them may say their moral compromise means more conservative judges (something trump has indeed delivered), lower taxes (at least for the wealthy, it turns out) , and an end of america playing global policeman (and, they complain, global bank). but they don't seem to think trump's behavior in office is a deal-breaker: while the president's general approval ratings are in the toilet, 91% of republicans approve of the way the president is doing his job, according to gallup polling ; just 4% of democrats say the same.

monsters don't make us; we make them. it is largely conservative white americans, long subtly encouraged in their bigotries and entitlements by politicians seeking power, that made donald trump.

and until the republican party and the people who vote for its candidates decide to put country first -- before their hunger for political dominance, before their desired return to a harsh racial and gender hierarchy -- we will never be free of the trumpist racism, fecklessness and stupidity that is embarrassing to watch in an interview, and has brought our nation to its knees."
'Blatant disrespect of Black women': Women leaders criticize treatment of Black women being considered as Biden VP pick,19,i4qm6n,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/05/black-women-leaders-criticize-treatment-black-biden-vp-contenders/3298252001/,36,1596744396.0,[deleted],"close joe biden is facing increased pressure to tap a woman of color as his running mate in the wake of america's reckoning with racism. he says he'll have his pick this month. (aug. 3) ap domestic

washington – over 100 black women leaders and activists slammed comments made of black women being considered to be joe biden's running mate as racist and sexist in an open letter published wednesday.

sen. kamala harris, rep. karen bass, former us ambassador susan rice, rep. val demings and former georgia democratic gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams have all been floated as possible vice presidential contenders for biden.

the letter comes as biden is nearing an announcement on his vice presidential pick. it also comes just days after a virginia mayor made a facebook post that read, “joe biden has just announced aunt jemima as his vp pick.”

barry presgraves, mayor of luray, va., is now facing calls to resign following the post, which has since been deleted, according to a report from wtop.

riots. radicalism. corruption.: trump and biden supporters turn to apocalyptic themes in campaign ad wars.

""regardless of your political affiliation, whether it's the media, members of the vice-presidential vetting committee, a former governor, a top political donor, or a small town mayor: we are not your aunt jemimas,"" the letter said. ""the use of the racist myth of a happy, black servant portrayed as a happy domestic worker loyal to her white employer is not lost on us.

""while some of the relentless attacks on black women and our leadership abilities have been more suggestive than others, make no mistake--we are qualified and ambitious without remorse,"" the letter continued.

influential leaders such as aimee allison, founder and president of she the people, key members of the naacp like vice-chair karen boykin-towns and roslyn m. brock, chairman emeritus of the national board of directors, and latosha brown, founder of black voters matters, were among those who signed the letter.

jotaka eaddy, founder and ceo of full circle strategies, a social impact and political consulting firm, helped spearhead the letter. she said that the black women over the past several months have faced narratives of being ""too ambitious"" or comments of these women not being apologetic.

eaddy also criticized presgraves comments, saying that is the type of comments that black women running for office have to face.

""what we are seeing is that these women are being subjected to treatment that others in the process, and men before that has been in the same process, haven't been subjected to,"" eaddy said.

biden, who committed to choosing a woman as his running mate in march, said last month that at least four black women were being vetted. black women voters have called on biden to choose a black woman as his running mate.

many of the leading contenders, such as harris, have been scrutinized.

politico reported last month that former sen. chris dodd, who is a member of biden’s vice presidential search committee, criticized harris for her clash with the former vice president at the first democratic debate over his civil rights record. dodd reportedly said: “she laughed and said, ‘that’s politics.’ she had no remorse.""

dodd's comments have drawn criticism, particularly from democratic women, who say harris is being held to a standard that wouldn’t apply to a man.

over the past couple of weeks, biden's outreach to women of color has also been criticized.

in july, she the people, which advocates for women of color, outlined concerns about biden's outreach to women of color, particularly in battleground states. one way to help gain support among the crucial voting bloc was for biden to pick a woman of color as his running mate, the she the people memo stated.

in the wednesday open letter, the women wrote that ""black women have been and remain vital across sectors,"" naming women like civil rights activist ella baker, shirley chisholm, the first black woman elected to congress, and journalist ida b. wells.

""we are servant leaders -- motivated by a desire to uplift and advance our communities and nation,"" the letter said. ""and we will not tolerate racist or sexist tropes consistently utilized in an effort to undermine our power.

""no matter who you are supporting for vice president, you should be equally outraged by the blatant disrespect of black women.""

New York Attorney General Moves To Dissolve The NRA After Fraud Investigation,438,i4ucjp,https://www.npr.org/2020/08/06/899712823/new-york-attorney-general-moves-to-dissolve-the-nra-after-fraud-investigation,86,1596758225.0,,"new york attorney general moves to dissolve the nra after fraud investigation

updated at 2 p.m. et

the attorney general of new york took action thursday to dissolve the national rifle association following an 18-month investigation that found evidence the powerful gun rights group is ""fraught with fraud and abuse.""

attorney general letitia james claims in a lawsuit filed thursday that she found financial misconduct in the millions of dollars and that it contributed to a loss of more than $64 million over a three-year period.

the suit alleges that top nra executives misused charitable funds for personal gain, awarded contracts to friends and family members, and provided contracts to former employees to ensure loyalty.

seeking to dissolve the nra is the most aggressive sanction james could have sought against the not-for-profit organization, which james has jurisdiction over because it is registered in new york. james has a wide range of authorities relating to nonprofits in the state, including the authority to force organizations to cease operations or dissolve. the nra is all but certain to contest it.

the nra said in a statement that the legal action was political, calling it a ""baseless premeditated attack on our organization and the second amendment freedoms it fights to defend... we not only will not shrink from this fight – we will confront it and prevail.""

""the nra's influence has been so powerful that the organization went unchecked for decades while top executives funneled millions into their own pockets,"" james said in a statement. ""the nra is fraught with fraud and abuse, which is why, today, we seek to dissolve the nra, because no organization is above the law.""

james' complaint names the national rifle association as a whole but also names four current and former nra executives: executive vice president wayne lapierre, general counsel john frazer, former chief financial officer woody phillips and former chief of staff joshua powell.

it lists dozens of examples of alleged financial malfeasance, including the use of nra funds for vacations, private jets and expensive meals. in a statement, james' office said that the charitable organization's executives ""instituted a culture of self-dealing, mismanagement and negligent oversight"" that contributed to ""the waste and loss of millions in assets.""

the lawsuit seeks to dissolve the nra in its entirety and asks the court to order lapierre and other current and former executives to pay back unlawful profits. it also seeks to remove lapierre and frazer from the organization's leadership and prevent the four named individuals from ever serving again on the board of a charity in new york.

allegations against ceo wayne lapierre

lapierre, who also serves as ceo, has held the top position at the organization for nearly 30 years. in the attorney general's lawsuit he is accused of using charitable funds for personal gain, including a post-employment contract valued at more than $17 million that was not approved by the nra's board of directors.

the lawsuit also claims that lapierre received more than $1.2 million in expense reimbursements over four years, including gifts for friends, travel expenses and memberships at golf clubs and hotels.

and it alleges that he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on private plane trips, including for extended family when he was not present; traveled to africa with his wife on a safari gifted by an nra vendor; and spent more than $3.6 million on luxury black car services and travel consultants in the past two years.

those who attempted to blow the whistle on this behavior, the suit claims, were retaliated against by lapierre.

allegations against former cfo woody phillips, former chief of staff joshua powell and general counsel john frazer

james' lawsuit alleges that phillips, whose job it was to manage the financial operations of the charitable organization, lied on financial disclosure forms and set up numerous deals to enrich himself and his girlfriend.

the new york attorney general claims that phillips set up a contract for himself just before he retired and that the package was worth $1.8 million — purportedly for consulting services to the incoming treasurer. but the incoming treasurer told the new york attorney general that he was not aware of this contract. phillips also directed a deal worth more than $1 million to his girlfriend, the suit alleges.

meanwhile, james alleges that former nra chief of staff joshua powell's salary more than tripled a little more than two years into his tenure, which began in 2016. while he began at $250,000, powell's salary rose to $800,000.

powell is also accused of directing charitable funds to be used for the benefit of his family members. the new york attorney general said that powell approved of a $5 million consulting contract with the firm mckenna & associates. that firm, in turn, hired powell's wife and passed her a $30,000 monthly consulting fee through the nra. powell also arranged for an nra vendor to hire his father as a paid photographer, leading to $90,000 in fees for his father — funds that were ultimately billed to the nra.

the new york attorney general did not allege that nra general counsel john frazer committed financial misconduct, but said that he failed to comply with board governance procedures, failed to ensure the nra was in compliance with whistleblower laws and repeatedly certified false or misleading annual statements by the nra.

the nra's other legal and financial challenges

separate from the new york attorney general's actions thursday, the district of columbia attorney general also sued: this time targeting the nra foundation, an independent group incorporated in d.c.

attorney general karl a. racine alleged that the foundation violated local laws by placing the nra's interests ahead of its own charitable purposes.

""charitable organizations function as public trusts — and district law requires them to use their funds to benefit the public, not to support political campaigns, lobbying, or private interests,"" racine said. ""with this lawsuit, we aim to recover donated funds that the nra foundation wasted. district nonprofits should be on notice that the office of the attorney general will file suit if we find evidence of illegal behavior.""

even before today's developments, the nra was in dire financial straits. a secret recording of an nra board meeting obtained by npr in april showed lapierre telling the audience that the nra's legal troubles have cost the organization $100 million.

""the cost that we bore was probably about a hundred-million-dollar hit in lost revenue and real cost to this association in 2018 and 2019,"" lapierre said, according to a recording by a source in the room. ""i mean, that's huge.""

much of this has to do with its legal troubles. facing congressional inquiries and investigations by multiple state attorneys general, as well as internal whistleblower complaints, the nra's finances have sagged under the burden of legal costs. in the ongoing litigation between the nra and ackerman mcqueen, its former public relations firm, a brief filed by the firm on april 15 indicates its belief that the nra has paid its outside legal counsel ""over $54 million"" in the past two years.

the turmoil at the nra also could have political ramifications ahead of the 2020 elections. the nra spent tens of millions of dollars in 2016 to support then-candidate donald trump — a role it appears it will be unlikely to be able to repeat given its current financial condition."
Personal news: why I’m now leaving MSNBC,1,i5d7ed,https://www.arianapekary.net/post/personal-news-why-i-m-now-leaving-msnbc,3,1596833381.0,,"







“just quit.”

﻿that’s the advice alec gave a year and a half ago when i expressed concerns about my job.

“you just quit. it’s that simple.”

“stay at msnbc at least until the midterms,” jeffrey said a couple years back. he advised to watch and see what happens.

“hang in there… you’re needed,” elizabeth recommended last winter. “i was in your shoes when i was younger but i stuck it out.”

a year and a half ago, simply quitting my job without knowing my next step sounded pretty radical. so i stuck it out a bit longer until we were in the middle of a pandemic to make a truly radical move.

july 24th was my last day at msnbc. i don’t know what i’m going to do next exactly but i simply couldn’t stay there anymore. my colleagues are very smart people with good intentions. the problem is the job itself. it forces skilled journalists to make bad decisions on a daily basis.

you may not watch msnbc but just know that this problem still affects you, too. all the commercial networks function the same – and no doubt that content seeps into your social media feed, one way or the other.

it’s possible that i’m more sensitive to the editorial process due to my background in public radio, where no decision i ever witnessed was predicated on how a topic or guest would “rate.” the longer i was at msnbc, the more i saw such choices — it’s practically baked in to the editorial process – and those decisions affect news content every day. likewise, it’s taboo to discuss how the ratings scheme distorts content, or it’s simply taken for granted, because everyone in the commercial broadcast news industry is doing the exact same thing.

but behind closed doors, industry leaders will admit the damage that’s being done.

“we are a cancer and there is no cure,” a successful and insightful tv veteran said to me. “but if you could find a cure, it would change the world.”

as it is, this cancer stokes national division, even in the middle of a civil rights crisis. the model blocks diversity of thought and content because the networks have incentive to amplify fringe voices and events, at the expense of others… all because it pumps up the ratings.

this cancer risks human lives, even in the middle of a pandemic. the primary focus quickly became what donald trump was doing (poorly) to address the crisis, rather than the science itself. as new details have become available about antibodies, a vaccine, or how covid actually spreads, producers still want to focus on the politics. important facts or studies get buried.

this cancer risks our democracy, even in the middle of a presidential election. any discussion about the election usually focuses on donald trump, not joe biden, a repeat offense from 2016 (trump smothers out all other coverage). also important is to ensure citizens can vote by mail this year, but i’ve watched that topic get ignored or “killed” numerous times.

context and factual data are often considered too cumbersome for the audience. there may be some truth to that (our education system really should improve the critical thinking skills of americans) – but another hard truth is that it is the job of journalists to teach and inform, which means they might need to figure out a better way to do that. they could contemplate more creative methods for captivating an audience. just about anything would improve the current process, which can be pretty rudimentary (think basing today’s content on whatever rated well yesterday, or look to see what’s trending online today).

occasionally, the producers will choose to do a topic or story without regard for how they think it will rate, but that is the exception, not the rule. due to the simple structure of the industry – the desire to charge more money for commercials, as well as the ratings bonuses that top-tier decision-makers earn – they always relapse into their old profitable programming habits.

i understand that the journalistic process is largely subjective and any group of individuals may justify a different set of priorities on any given day. therefore, it’s particularly notable to me, for one, that nearly every rundown at the network basically is the same, hour after hour. and two, they use this subjective nature of the news to justify economically beneficial decisions. i’ve even heard producers deny their role as journalists. a very capable senior producer once said: “our viewers don’t really consider us the news. they come to us for comfort.”

again, personally, i don’t think the people need to change. i think the job itself needs to change. there is a better way to do this. i’m not so cynical to think that we are absolutely doomed (though we are on that path). i know we can find a cure. if we can figure how to send a man to the moon, if alex trebek can defy the odds with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, and if harry reid can actually overcome pancreatic cancer (he’s now cancer free), then we can fix this, too.

“not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”

i know james baldwin wasn’t thinking about msnbc when he wrote that line in 1962, but those words spoke loudly to me in the summer of 2020. unfortunately, many of the same ailments are still at stake today. now maybe we can’t really change the inherently broken structure of broadcast news, but i know for certain that it won’t change unless we actually face it, in public, and at least try to change it.

through this pandemic and the surreal, alienating lockdown, i’ve witnessed many people question their lives and what they’re doing with their time on this planet. i reckon i’m one of those people, looking for greater meaning and truth. as much as i love my life in new york city and really don’t want to leave, i feel fortunate to be able to return to virginia in the near term to reconnect with family, friends, and a community of independent journalists. i’m both nervous and excited about this change. thanks to covid-19, i’m learning to live with uncertainty.

and so very soon, i’m going to be seeking you out, any one of you who also may sense that the news is fundamentally flawed and is frustrated by it. this effort will start informally but i hope to crystallize a plan for when better, safer days are upon us. on that front, feel free to reach out anytime if you would like to discuss any of this – whether in agreement or not. more than ever, i’m craving a full and civil discourse.

until next time, thank you for reading. i wish you all well.

Explainer: Trump wants to bypass U.S. coronavirus aid talks with executive order. Can he?,191,i5e8p7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-orders-explain/explainer-trump-wants-to-bypass-u-s-coronavirus-aid-talks-with-executive-order-can-he-idUSKCN2531W0,68,1596837371.0,,"washington (reuters) - with congressional democrats and white house negotiators so far unable to agree on a deal to salve the heavy economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, president donald trump has threatened to bypass congress with an executive order.

file photo: u.s. president donald trump speaks at a whirlpool corporation washing machine factory in clyde, ohio, u.s., august 6, 2020. reuters/joshua roberts

some of his proposals exceed his legal authority and would face immediate legal challenges, though in at least one case house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi, the nation’s top democrat, told him to just go ahead.

what does trump want to do?

trump said on twitter he is considering executive orders to continue expanded unemployment benefits, reinstate a moratorium on evictions, cut payroll taxes and continue a suspension of student loan repayments amid a health crisis that has killed nearly 160,000 americans.

he and administration officials negotiating with congress have not provided specifics.

can he do it?

the constitution puts control of federal spending in the hands of congress, not the president, so trump does not have the legal authority to issue executive orders determining how money should be spent on coronavirus.

democrats said executive orders would prompt a court fight, but legal action could take months.

trump has sidestepped congress on spending before. in 2019, he declared a national emergency at the border with mexico to shift billions of dollars from the pentagon budget to help pay for a promised wall that was the cornerstone of his 2016 election campaign.

congress passed legislation to stop him, but there were too few votes in the republican-controlled senate to override his veto.

“there has to be a political will to do that and there has to be a priority given by members of congress to assert their institutional interests,” said mark rozell, dean of the schar school of policy and government at george mason university in virginia. “and that just isn’t there right now.”

would democrats or republicans object?

the $600 per week enhanced unemployment benefit in the massive “cares act” passed in march has been a major sticking point in negotiations. democrats want to continue the federal payment, which expired on july 24, to the tens of millions who have lost their jobs in the crisis and have rejected a short-term extension. trump’s fellow republicans have argued that is too high a payment, contending it is a disincentive to work.

the moratorium on evictions was less contentious, and could be covered by reprogramming money that congress has already approved for housing that has not been spent. pelosi on thursday said an order extending the moratorium “would be a good thing.”

congressional republicans and democrats alike reject cutting the payroll tax, which is collected from both employers and employees to fund social security and medicare. a cut would disproportionately benefit americans with high salaries, and threaten funding for the popular programs for retirees. it also only benefits people still getting paychecks, not those who have lost their jobs.

the parties are closer together on student loans. democrats included a 12-month extension of the student loan payment suspension in a relief bill the house passed in may. republican senators did not include student loan relief in the proposal they unveiled in july. however, there is a republican plan in congress to extend the suspension for three months."
"Facebook ‘fired employee who collected evidence of pro-conservative bias’, leaked messages show",170,i5ex5l,https://www.independent.co.uk//life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-fire-employee-conservative-right-wing-breitbart-charlie-kirk-dimaond-and-silk-a9659301.html,39,1596839727.0,[deleted],"a senior facebook engineer who collected evidence of the company providing preferential treatment to right-wing pages was reportedly fired by the company for breaking its “respectful communication policy.”

according to internal posts seen by buzzfeed, organisations including right-wing publisher breitbart, turning point usa founder charlie kirk, trump advocates diamond and silk, and conservative video maker prager university (prageru) have all received preferential treatment to stop their posts being blocked by facebook’s policies.

buzzfeed cites internal posts made on workplace, the company’s business version of facebook. the “tasks” the engineer had cited as examples of the alleged special treatment were made private and inaccessible to employees, according to another workplace post from another employee.

on 22 july an employee reportedly posted to the company’s misinformation policy group, pointing out that someone had acted on breitbart’s behalf to clear misinformation strikes.

“a breitbart escalation marked ‘urgent: end of day’ was resolved on the same day, with all misinformation strikes against breitbart’s page and against their domain cleared without explanation,” the employee apparently wrote.

that employee also alleged that a partially false rating applied to an instagram post from charlie kirk was flagged for “priority” escalation by facebook vice president of global public policy and former bush administration employee joel kaplan.

kaplan reportedly argued against moves that would make facebook less politically polarising but were described as “antigrowth” and requiring “a moral stance”.

similar action was reportedly taken in favour of prageru, with the same employee claiming a “two weeks long effort” to stop the site from being given repeat offender status which would have limited its reach and advertising business.

“it appears that policy people have been intervening in fact-checks on behalf of *exclusively* right-wing publishers, to avoid them getting repeat-offender status,” another employee wrote in the same misinformation group.

this culture was also apparently experienced by a journalist who worked for one of facebook’s fact-checking partners.

“of the publishers that don’t follow the procedure, it seems to be mostly ones on the right. instead of appealing to the fact-checker they immediately call their rep at facebook,” said the journalist, who spoke to buzzfeed anonymously because they were not authorised to speak publicly.

“they jump straight up and say ‘censorship, first amendment, freedom.’ i think facebook is a bit afraid of them because of the trump administration,” they added.

“i do think we’re headed for a problematic scenario where facebook is going to be used to aggressively undermine the legitimacy of the us elections, in a way that has never been possible in history,” one facebook employee apparently wrote in a group on workplace.

“we defer to third-party fact-checkers on the rating that a piece of content receives,“ facebook spokesperson liz bourgeois said in a statement.

”when a fact checker applies a rating, we apply a label and demotion. but we are responsible for how we manage our internal systems for repeat offenders. we apply additional system wide penalties for multiple false ratings, including demonetization and the inability to advertise, unless we determine that one or more of those ratings does not warrant additional consequences.""

the independent reached out to facebook for further clarification about kaplan’s reported actions and the anonymous journalists’ statements, as well as more information regarding the workplace posts.

in a statement, facebook said: “we defer to third-party fact-checkers on the rating that a piece of content receives. when a fact checker applies a rating, we apply a label and demotion. but we are responsible for how we manage our internal systems for repeat offenders,"" the company said.

""we apply additional system wide penalties for multiple false ratings, including demonetization and the inability to advertise, unless we determine that one or more of those ratings does not warrant additional consequences. to this day, we remain the only company that partners with over 70 fact-checking organizations to apply fact-checks to millions of pieces of content"".

this news comes as bias against conservatives by social media companies remains a talking point among the right-wing. president trump has begun to implement policy which would restrict the freedom of speech of these companies – as well as all websites – unless they are politically neutral.

political neutrality has never been a caveat of the first amendment, which does not in fact cover private companies, only government organisations."
U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump,169,i5p8xz,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/russia-ukraine-trump-biden-intelligence-foreign-interference-election.html,72,1596874142.0,,"photo: samuel corum/getty images

two weeks ago, william evanina, director of the united states national counterintelligence and security center, published a somewhat vague warning about various forms of foreign interference in the upcoming election. on friday, he followed up with a more direct and incriminating one, specifically warning that russia is working to help reelect donald trump. even more important is what this warning unmistakably implies: that trump and his republican allies in congress are actively cooperating with russia’s campaign.

trump obviously tends to respond with rage at the suggestion that russia wants him to win, let alone that he is accepting the assistance. so evanina’s summary delicately surrounds the revelations about trump and moscow with superficially balancing material. the report highlights three countries that want to influence the election: russia, china, and iran. the report notes that the latter two want trump to lose, while russia wants him to win.

this seems intended to let republicans claim that there is foreign interference on both sides. and it’s true, as far as it goes.

but the comparisons end there. what is china doing to defeat trump? its government has “grown increasingly critical of the current administration’s covid-19 response, closure of china’s houston consulate, and actions on other issues.” and iran’s efforts “probably will focus on on-line influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-u.s. content.”

in others words, iran and china are undermining trump by criticizing him in public remarks, possibly including some mean tweets.

russia’s efforts to help trump include all that. in addition, the statement notes, “pro-russia ukrainian parliamentarian andriy derkach is spreading claims about corruption — including through publicizing leaked phone calls — to undermine former vice president biden’s candidacy and the democratic party.”

derkach and his russian allies despise biden, who spearheaded the administration’s efforts to reform ukraine, rein in its oligarchs, and diminish russian influence. they have attempted to depict biden’s reform efforts as a corrupt plot to enrich his son hunter.

derkach has been working openly with trump’s lawyer, rudy giuliani. none of this is a secret. here are the two of them meeting in kiev in december:

rudy just met in #ukraine with former pro-#russia mp andriy derkach just days ahead of peace talks between #ukraine’s president zelensky and putin🇷🇺.#ukraine’s president learned of rudy’s arrival from the media. “equally shocked by his arrival was the us embassy.”😳 pic.twitter.com/rbmefj7kgk — dr. dena grayson (@drdenagrayson) december 5, 2019

giuliani told the washington post earlier this summer that derkach “doesn’t seem pro-russian to me.” in case that ruse was fooling anybody, u.s. intelligence has now officially described derkach as an organ of russian political interference.

meanwhile, senate republicans on the homeland security committee are holding hearings in an attempt to substantiate this charge — or, more realistically, to insinuate it. they have produced no evidence to advance their charge. the russians have given republicans stolen tapes of secret conversations biden held with ukrainians during his tenure as vice-president, and pro-trump media outlets have hyped up the material, but nothing they have is inconsistent with the narrative that mainstream news organizations found. biden was working to clean up ukraine.

senate republicans tried to be cagey about their activities. after pro-russian ukrainians said they’d passed materials on to republican officials, a johnson staffer told nbc news in july that it was “‘false’ the committee has received any ‘oppo,’ or opposition research, without responding directly to whether that covers any materials from foreign sources.”

the washington post reported that homeland security committee chairman ron johnson received secret documents from ukrainians. and former giuliani associate lev parnas has confessed to putting devin nunes, the top republican on the house intelligence committee and perhaps trump’s most energetic defender on all things russia, in touch with one of the ukrainians releasing documents in the united states.

there is hardly any secret to what they’re up to. johnson says he plans to release his report on biden in september. it hardly matters if the information russia gives him actually substantiates his allegations, or even whether it is authentic. the obvious plan is to splash some headlines into news screens in the heat of the campaign that seem to connect biden to some kind of wrongdoing.

in reality, it is not a scandal about biden at all. it’s a scandal about republican cooperation with a russian propaganda campaign.

what makes evanina’s statement on friday so significant is that it makes clear that the passing of information, real or otherwise, from various ukrainian figures to various trump allies is part of a russian-directed scheme to help trump win. republicans could tell russia that russian-controlled media are free to say anything they want, but republicans aren’t going to launder their propaganda for them. instead, they are doing everything in their power to exploit it.

update: the unanswered question of why evanina followed his first, vague statement with a second, more specific one has an answer. on saturday morning, the new york times magazine﻿ published a long, devastating story by robert draper about trump’s politicization of intelligence. draper’s reporting forced friday night’s release, which directly acknowledged russia’s active preference to help trump win.

draper’s story also helps contextualize the essentially decorative mentions of china and iran. intelligence officials are terrified of enraging trump by confirming that russia wants him to win, even though the conclusion is obvious. if you want to understand why officials added references to china and iran to create the illusion of balance — even though those two countries don’t seem to be taking any steps to help biden, and biden certainly isn’t cooperating with them — draper’s narrative explains the intense pressure they’re facing."

marrakech, morocco (ap) — abdenabi nouidi sold his favorite horse for $150 to help feed the others on the team that pulls tourists in carriages through the buzzing streets of marrakech, and he is still scared about the future for the others.

the prospect of starvation looms for carriage horses and other animals normally used in morocco’s tourist mecca., since visitors have vanished during the coronavirus pandemic.

the society for the protection of animals abroad, or spana, says hundreds of morocco’s carriage horses and donkeys are threatened amid the collapsing tourism industry. they are among the estimated 200 million horses, donkeys, camels and elephants worldwide providing various livelihoods for over a half-billion people.

the north african kingdom closed its doors to outsiders after the first virus case was confirmed march 2. it also recently issued a ban on domestic travel to eight cities, including marrakech.

thousands of people in the city depend on the carriage horses for their livelihood. a single horse carriage in marrakech supports four to five families, including owners, drivers and stable boys, driver abdeljalil belghaoute said.

he spoke from his carriage, waiting in a line near the famed jamaa el fnaa square, hoping that someone would want a ride.

’if you have a shop, you can close it. if you sell goods, you store them. but imagine having ... horses who need to eat, drink and get medical care,” said abdeljalil nouidi.

for two decades, the four nouidi brothers have taken tourists on sightseeing jaunts in horse-drawn carriages. now they have empty pockets and mouths to feed, both at home and at the rundown complex outside marrakech where drivers stable their horses.

the brothers were forced to sell seven of their horses in july. abdenabi nouidi’s favorite, cocotte, was among them.

“this is not something i can easily forgive myself for,” he said, recalling a promise he made to cocotte 15 years ago to keep him forever.

the nouidi brothers say their horses are visibly nervous and know an abrupt change in their lives may be coming. with no carriage work, the horses’ routine has been disrupted, feed is running low and stablemates are leaving for good.

spana helped carriage owners provide the basics for their horses when the covid-19 pandemic reached morocco. it delivered three months’ worth of feed to almost 600 horses in the city and the neighboring town of aït ourir during the country’s lockdown.

“it became very clear to us when the lockdown was first imposed that many of marrakech’s working animals would need our help or face a dire outcome,” said the head veterinarian at spana’s marrakech center, hassan lamrini.

advertisement

the center, in a working-class neighborhood, is a mecca for the city’s thousands of working animals. since 1988, the team of vets and technicians have cared for donkeys, mules and horses free of charge.

lamrini said the center has treated an increasing number of cases of colic, an abdominal pain that causes complications in the digestive system, often due to malnutrition. colic can be fatal.

“there is not much in the world that matters to me more than caring for these animals. they are my entire life,” said boujamaa ninich, who has dedicated 50 years to working with spana. he spends weeks on end sleeping in a little room at the center to ensure the animals are cared for after dark.

“they give so much to their owners. there is so little that we can give back,’ he said.

marrakech was nearly at a standstill on a recent visit. the jamma el fnaa square, a vast area with hawkers, food vendors and snake-dancers, was nearly deserted.

“only tourism can save us from this catastrophe we’re facing,” said belghaoute, the carriage driver hoping for a fare.

the moroccan government earlier this year launched a social media campaign to encourage citizens to explore their country, but spiking numbers of covid-19 cases led to the travel ban for eight of the country’s top tourist cities.

authorities counted 28,500 infections and 435 deaths as of thursday, but experts say all counts in all countries understate the true toll of the pandemic, due to limited testing, missed mild cases and other factors.

“the longer this goes on, horses and families will struggle to survive. we’re really scared by how bad this can get,” belghaoute said.

Thousands of bikers heading to South Dakota rally to be blocked at tribal land checkpoints,115,i6oah7,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/08/thousands-bikers-outh-dakota-rally-to-be-blocked-tribal-land-checkpoints,21,1597026435.0,[deleted],"clampdown comes as fears mount that mask-free bikers headed to large gathering could spread coronavirus to tribal groups

thousands of bikers heading to south dakota’s 10-day sturgis motorcycle rally will not be allowed through cheyenne river sioux checkpoints, a spokesman for the native american group said on saturday.

the decision to prevent access across tribal lands to the annual rally, which could attract as many as 250,000 bikers amid fears it could lead to a massive, regional coronavirus outbreak, comes as part of larger covid-19 prevention policy. the policy has pitted seven tribes that make up the great sioux nation against federal and state authorities, which both claim the checkpoints are illegal.

a duty officer for the cheyenne river sioux told the guardian on saturday that only commercial and emergency vehicles will be let through the checkpoints onto reservation land.

a number of bikers had tried to enter but had been turned back, they said. other reservations in the region, including the oglala sioux, were also turning away bikers that had attempted routes to sturgis that pass through sovereign land.

under cheyenne river tribal guidelines non-residents driving non-commercial out-of-state vehicles are never allowed through the reservation. during the rally, non-commercial vehicles with south dakota plates are also not allowed through.

the clampdown comes as fears mount that mask-free bikers visiting sturgis for the largest gathering of people since the start of the covid-19 epidemic could spread the virus to tribal groups that are already experiencing a rise in cases.

oglala sioux recorded 163 cases last week, while the cheyenne river sioux has seen cases rise to 79, according to the tribe’s website.

the restrictions come as local law enforcement reported a convergence of bikers from all directions. according to reports, many bikers heading for sturgis expressed defiance at rules and restrictions that have marked life during the coronavirus pandemic.

while south dakota has fared better than most states – it ranks 38th in covid deaths per capita, according to a reuters tally – cases have risen in recent weeks as hotspots move into the midwest.

during the rally, people are expected to cram bars and pack concerts with at least 34 acts playing. “screw covid,” read the design on one t-shirt on sale. “i went to sturgis.”

stephen sample, who rode his harley-davidson from arizona, told the associated press that the event was a break from the routine of the last several months.

“i don’t want to die, but i don’t want to be cooped up all my life either,” sample, 66, said, adding that he had weighed the risks of navigating the crowds, but the same thrill-seeking that attracted him to riding motorcycles seemed to win out.

“i think we’re all willing to take a chance,” he said, but acknowledged the trip “could be a major mistake.”

south dakota’s republican governor, kristi noem, has supported holding the sturgis rally, pointing out that no virus outbreak was documented from the several thousand people who turned out to see donald trump at mount rushmore last month.

the rally is marking its 80th anniversary and typically injects $800m into south dakota’s economy. meade county sheriff, rob merwin, said: “it’s going to be a lot of people and a lot of motorcycles all over the place. people are tired of being penned up by this pandemic.”

on friday, a worker at the event told the guardian crowds seemed larger than in previous years and warned that sturgis attendees were paying little heed to medical advice.

“i’ve not seen one single person wearing a mask,” said bartender jessica christian, 29. “it’s just pretty much the mentality that, ‘if i get it, i get it.’”

“in downtown sturgis it’s just madness,” christian added. “people not socially distancing, everybody touching each other. it’ll be interesting to see how that turns out.”

over 60% of sturgis 6,900 residents who responded to a city council survey in may said they wanted the rally canceled.

a month later, the council voted to move ahead, although it canceled all city-sponsored events associated with the rally and included measures such as hand-sanitizing stations. sturgis mayor mark carstensen said throughout the pandemic, “the state of south dakota has been the freedom state and the city of sturgis has stayed true to that”."
Portland protesters set police building on fire and clash with authorities,100,i6q3rl,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/09/portland-protesters-clash-police-building-fire,15,1597032306.0,,"a fire lit inside a police union building by a small fraction of protesters in portland overnight led the authorities to declare the situation a riot and then use flashbang munitions and smoke canisters to force hundreds away from the area.

the flare-up in the oregon city marred demonstrations that took place across portland this weekend as part of protests that have continued daily, calling for police restructuring and systemic anti-racism reforms, since george floyd was killed by police in minneapolis in may.

portland protests had been in a calmer vein since federal law enforcement agents withdrew in late july, but early sunday saw a clash at the scene of the arson attack.

it was the second time such a fire has been set in recent days. though both fires were quickly put out, the incidents brought criticism of individuals who have been provoking police by damaging property and other belligerent tactics, in contrast to much wider, calmer protests, according to a report by the oregonian.

three officers were hurt during efforts to clear a crowd of several hundred people outside the portland police association building, police said in a statement.

rallies had been held earlier in the afternoon and evening throughout the city.

seneca cayson, a black business owner who helped lead peaceful gatherings in downtown portland, worries that incidents of vandalism and taunting of law enforcement by a tiny minority of the many thousands of white protesters turning out distracts from the main aims of the black lives matter movement.

but he speculated that such clashes also draw more attention to racial injustice and said of white rebels: “we are fighting alongside them to … be equal.”

many cite competing voices and the harsh glare of a national spotlight, which has reduced the situation to a culture war when the reality is much more complex.

“it happens so much that the things that we care about get hijacked and get put on the back burner. and that just gets put into a big barrel with everything else,” said neil anderson, another local black business owner. “we all want the same thing. but so often we get drowned out.”

for many, part of breaking down racial barriers means taking funds from and restructuring the police entirely.

portland’s population is less than 6% black but people of color have been disproportionately stopped by a city program that created a gun violence reduction team.

an analysis of police use of force published last month found that in 2019 officers were much more likely to use force against black people and particularly young black men than other groups, despite overall trends towards less use of force.

“it is the entire culture of the portland police bureau that is fundamentally unmanageable and must change,” said jo ann hardesty, the city’s first black councilwoman and an activist who has pressed for police reform for three decades.

“thirty years is a long time to be asking for the exact same reforms. the difference now is there are tens of thousands of portlanders who want the exact same thing,” hardesty said.

police said demonstrators broke into the union building late saturday, set the fire and were adding to it when officers made the riot declaration.

democratic mayor ted wheeler said violent protesters are serving as political “props” for donald trump in a divisive election season where the president is hammering on a law-and-order message.

meanwhile, oregon state politicians will discuss on monday in a special session passing a broader ban on police use of chokeholds and further restricting other use of force, the oregonian reported on sunday."

in the first six months of 2020, customs and borden protection officers seized nearly 20,000 counterfeit u.s. driver’s licenses at chicago’s o’hare airport alone, according to a report.

the 19,888 licenses and other fake documents were included in 1,513 overseas shipments, mostly from china and hong kong, cbp said, according to fox 5 in new york city. others were from south korea and britain.

ralph piccirilli, cbp’s acting area port director in chicago, called the counterfeits (made mostly for people in their twenties) “very realistic.”

dallas-fort worth cbp port director timothy lemaux said seeking out a counterfeit license overseas is risky because you have to give your personal information.

""what is most disconcerting about these interceptions, besides the volume in which we are experiencing, is the ease in which so many young people freely share their personal information with counterfeiters abroad,"" lemaux said in a statement. ""we'll continue to collaborate with local law enforcement to educate the public, and anyone who is contemplating purchasing a counterfeit id online, on the potential dangers of sharing your personal, identifiable information with a criminal element.""

dallas has seen an influx in counterfeit document seizures, around 2,000 since 2019.

dallas-area cbp officers have partnered with local universities to educate students about the dangers of giving their personal information online to get a fake license, cbp said.

last fall, cbp agents in kentucky intercepted nearly 3,000 fake u.s. licenses and more than 3,000 blank card stocks for counterfeiting licenses that were headed for new york city, the new york post reported.

one of the shipments was postmarked to a convicted child rapist in new york, leading agents to believe they might attract minors with the promise of fake i.d.s, cbp officials said.

“some of the major concerns as it relates to fraudulent identity documents is identity theft, worksite enforcement, critical infrastructure protection, fraud linked to immigration-related crimes such as human smuggling and human trafficking, and these documents can be used by those individuals associated with terrorism to minimize scrutiny from travel screening measures,” thomas mahn, the louisville port director, said."

congressional democratic leaders on sunday called for an intelligence report on foreign interference in the 2020 election to be made public so, they said, voters can be more informed about such efforts than they were in 2016.

""the american people need to know what the russians are doing in this case and the american people believe that they should decide who the next president is, not vladimir putin,"" said house speaker nancy pelosi, who appeared on ""fox news sunday"" and cnn's ""state of the union,"" referring to the russian president.

on friday, william evanina – director of the national counterintelligence and security center, which is part of the office of the director of national intelligence – issued a statement that said ""foreign states will continue to use covert and overt influence measures in their attempts to sway u.s. voters’ preferences and perspectives, shift u.s. policies, increase discord in the united states, and undermine the american people’s confidence in our democratic process.""

evanina said china, russia and iran were the primary concerns. he said while russia was working to ""boost"" president donald trump’s candidacy, china and iran were working to thwart his reelection.

but pelosi said russia's efforts on trump's behalf were of a different magnitude than those of china and iran.

""they're not equivalent,"" she said. ""russia is actively, 24/7 interfering in our election. they did so in 2016, and they are doing so now,"" pelosi said. china, on the other hand, may prefer biden ""but they’re not really getting involved in the presidential election.""

evanina's statement said ""russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate"" former vice president joe biden, the presumptive democratic nominee. it did not provide details, but said, ""some kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost president trump’s candidacy on social media and russian television.""

in contrast, the statement said china sees trump as ""unpredictable"" and cited its ""public"" rhetoric and statements as examples of its opposition to trump's reelection.

national security adviser robert o'brien defended the administration's handling of election security on cbs news' ""face the nation"" and insisted ""it's not just russia"" trying to interfere.

""there's no higher concern that we have than maintaining the free and fair elections that are the cornerstone of our democracy,"" o'brien said. ""we know that there are people overseas, the chinese, the iranians, the russians, others who would like to interfere with our democracy. and we're going to fight against that. and we're going to take every step necessary to harden our election infrastructure, harden our cyberinfrastructure and protect our elections 100%.""

sen. richard blumenthal, d-conn., wrote in a washington post op-ed on friday that the dni statement ""only hints at the threats"" to the election and the details he saw in a classified briefing were ""chilling.""

""i believe the american public needs and deserves to know them. the information should be declassified immediately.""

senate minority leader charles schumer, d-n.y. said sunday on abc news' ""this week,"" that he agreed the information around election interference should be declassified ""without compromising sources.""

pelosi: congress appears to be the target of a 'concerted foreign interference campaign'

the dni statement said russia was particularly focused on biden's work in ukraine during the obama administration and named ""pro-russia ukrainian parliamentarian andriy derkach"" as a figure who ""is spreading claims about corruption – including through publicizing leaked phone calls – to undermine former vice president biden’s candidacy.""

trump was impeached in december for allegedly leveraging military aid to pressure ukraine into announcing corruption investigations related to biden and his son, hunter. the president was eventually acquitted on the articles of impeachment by the senate.

schumer linked the russian effort to smear biden to a senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee investigation led by sen. ron johnson, r-wisc., into hunter biden's work in ukraine. he said johnson and sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., were conducting the probe ""based on false russian intelligence.""

""they should be ashamed of themselves for what they’re doing, letting the russians manipulate them and us, the american people,"" schumer said.

schumer called for the administration to impose additional sanctions on russia, but o'brien said there ""almost nothing"" of russia's left to sanction because the trump administration had already taken so many actions against the country.

""there's not a lot left we can do with the russians,"" he said, ""but nevertheless, we continue to message the russians. and president trump continues to message the russians: 'don't get involved in our elections.'""

but o'brien declined to comment when asked if trump told putin not to interfere in u.s. elections during their most recent conversation.

""unlike perhaps some of my predecessors or others who leaked documents, i don't get into the conversations that the president has with foreign heads of state,"" o'brien said in an apparent reference to former national security adviser john bolton. ""those are private conversations.""

trump has questioned the intelligence community's unanimous assessment that russia tried to influence the election in his favor in 2016.

in response to the dni statement, trump said friday at his golf club in bedminster, new jersey ""i think the last person russia wants to see in office is donald trump because nobody has been tougher on russia than i have – ever.""

but the president seemed to agree with the intelligence indicating china didn’t want him reelected. ""if joe biden was president, china would own our country,"" trump said.

The Trump Pandemic,1,i74yaf,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-coronavirus-deaths-timeline.html,9,1597095395.0,,"on july 17, president donald trump sat for a fox news interview at the white house. at the time, nearly 140,000 americans were dead from the novel coronavirus. the interviewer, chris wallace, showed trump a video clip in which robert redfield, the director of the centers for disease control and prevention, warned of a difficult fall and winter ahead. trump dismissed the warning. he scoffed that experts had misjudged the virus all along. “everybody thought this summer it would go away,” said trump. “they used to say the heat, the heat was good for it and it really knocks it out, remember? so they got that one wrong.”

trump’s account was completely backward. redfield and other u.s. public health officials had never promised that heat would knock out the virus. in fact, they had cautioned against that assumption. the person who had held out the false promise of a warm-weather reprieve, again and again, was trump. and he hadn’t gotten the idea from any of his medical advisers. he had gotten it from xi jinping, the president of china, in a phone call in february.

the phone call, the talking points trump picked up from it, and his subsequent attempts to cover up his alliance with xi are part of a deep betrayal. the story the president now tells—that he “built the greatest economy in history,” that china blindsided him by unleashing the virus, and that trump saved millions of lives by mobilizing america to defeat it—is a lie. trump collaborated with xi, concealed the threat, impeded the u.s. government’s response, silenced those who sought to warn the public, and pushed states to take risks that escalated the tragedy. he’s personally responsible for tens of thousands of deaths.

this isn’t speculation. all the evidence is in the public record. but the truth, unlike trump’s false narrative, is scattered in different places. it’s in emails, leaks, interviews, hearings, scientific reports, and the president’s stray remarks. this article puts those fragments together. it documents trump’s interference or negligence in every stage of the government’s failure: preparation, mobilization, public communication, testing, mitigation, and reopening.

trump has always been malignant and incompetent. as president, he has coasted on economic growth, narrowly averted crises of his own making, and corrupted the government in ways that many americans could ignore. but in the pandemic, his vices—venality, dishonesty, self-absorption, dereliction, heedlessness—turned deadly. they produced lies, misjudgments, and destructive interventions that multiplied the carnage. the coronavirus debacle isn’t, as trump protests, an “artificial problem” that spoiled his presidency. it’s the fulfillment of everything he is.

trump never prepared for a pandemic. for years, he had multiple warnings—briefings, reports, simulations, intelligence assessments—that a crisis such as this one was likely and that the government wasn’t ready for it. in april, he admitted that he was informed of the risks: “i always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things that could happen.” but when the virus arrived, the federal government was still ill-equipped to deal with it. according to trump, “we had no ventilators. we had no testing. we had nothing.”

that’s an exaggeration. but it’s true that the stockpile of pandemic supplies was depleted and that the government’s system for producing virus tests wasn’t designed for such heavy demand. so why, for the first three years of his presidency, did trump do nothing about it? he often brags that he spent $2 trillion to beef up the military. but he squeezed the budget for pandemics, disbanded the federal team in charge of protecting the country from biological threats, and stripped down the beijing office of the cdc.

trump has been asked several times to explain these decisions. he has given two answers. one is that he wanted to save money. “some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years,” he said in february. “if we have a need, we can get them very quickly. … i’m a businessperson. i don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them.”

his second answer is that he had other priorities. in march, at a fox news town hall, bret baier asked trump why he hadn’t updated the test production system. “i’m thinking about a lot of other things, too, like trade,” trump replied. “i’m not thinking about this.” in may, abc’s david muir asked him, “what did you do when you became president to restock those cupboards that you say were bare?” trump gave the same answer: “i have a lot of things going on.”

trump prepared for a war, not for a virus. he wagered that if a pandemic broke out, he could pull together the resources to contain it quickly. he was wrong. but that was just the first of many mistakes.

in early january, trump was warned about a deadly new virus in china. he was also told that the chinese government was understating the outbreak. (see this timeline for a detailed chronology of what trump knew and when he knew it.) this was inconvenient, because trump was about to sign a lucrative trade deal with beijing. “we have a great relationship with china right now, so i don’t want to speak badly of anyone,” trump told laura ingraham in a fox news interview on jan. 10. he added that he was looking forward to a second deal with xi. when ingraham asked about china’s violations of human rights, trump begged off. “i’m riding a fine line because we’re making … great trade deals,” he pleaded.

trump signed the deal on jan. 15. he lauded xi and said previous american presidents, not xi, were at fault for past troubles between the two countries. three days later, alex azar, trump’s secretary of health and human services, phoned him with an update on the spread of the virus. on jan. 21, the cdc announced the first infection in the united states. two of the government’s top health officials—anthony fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, and nancy messonnier, the director of the national center for immunization and respiratory diseases—said the virus was beginning to circulate around the world.

trump would later claim that he saw from the outset how grim the situation was. that was clear, he recalled, in the “initial numbers coming out from china.” but at the time, he told americans everything was fine. “we’re in great shape,” he assured maria bartiromo in a fox business interview on jan. 22. “china’s in good shape, too.” he preferred to talk about trade instead. “the china deal is amazing, and we’ll be starting phase two very soon,” he said. on cnbc, joe kernen asked trump whether there were any “worries about a pandemic.” “no, not at all,” the president replied. “we have it totally under control.” when kernen asked whether the chinese were telling the whole truth about the virus, trump said they were. “i have a great relationship with president xi,” he boasted. “we just signed probably the biggest deal ever made.”

“we’re in great shape. china’s in good shape, too.” — trump, jan. 22

the crisis in china grew. in late january, trump’s medical advisers agreed with his national security team that he should suspend travel from china to the united states. but trump resisted. he had spent months cultivating a relationship with xi and securing the trade deal. he was counting on china to buy american goods and boost the u.s. economy, thereby helping him win reelection. he had said this to xi explicitly, in a conversation witnessed by then–national security adviser john bolton. trump also worried that a travel ban would scare the stock market. but by the end of the month, airlines were halting flights to china anyway. on jan. 31, trump gave in.

his advisers knew the ban would only buy time. they wanted to use that time to fortify america. but trump had no such plans. on feb. 1, he recorded a super bowl interview with sean hannity. hannity pointed out that the number of known infections in the united states had risen to eight, and he asked trump whether he was worried. the president brushed him off. “we pretty much shut it down coming in from china,” said trump. that was false: thanks to loopholes in the ban, the coronavirus strain that would engulf washington state arrived from china about two weeks later. but at the time of the interview, the ban hadn’t even taken effect. the important thing, to trump, was that he had announced the ban. he was less interested in solving the problem than in looking as though he had solved it. and in the weeks to come, he would argue that the ban had made other protective measures unnecessary.

there were three logical steps to consider after suspending travel from china. the first was suspending travel from europe. by jan. 21, trump’s advisers knew the virus was in france. by jan. 31, they knew it had reached italy, germany, finland, and the united kingdom. from conversations with european governments, they also knew that these governments, apart from italy, weren’t going to block travel from china. and they were directly informed that the flow of passengers from europe to the united states far exceeded the normal flow of passengers from china to the united states. trump’s deputy national security adviser, matthew pottinger, pleaded for a ban on travel from europe, but other advisers said this would hurt the economy in an election year. trump, persuaded by pottinger’s opponents, refused to go along.

“they say, ‘oh, he should do more.’ there’s nothing more you can do.” — trump, feb. 28

not until march 11, six weeks after blocking travel from china, did trump take similar action against europe. in a televised address, he acknowledged that travelers from europe had brought the disease to america. two months later, based on genetic and epidemiological analyses, the cdc would confirm that trump’s action had come too late, because people arriving from europe—nearly 2 million of them in february, hundreds of whom were infected—had already accelerated the spread of the virus in the united states.

the second step was to gear up production of masks, ventilators, and other medical supplies. in early february, trade adviser peter navarro, biomedical research director rick bright, and other officials warned of impending shortages of these supplies. azar would later claim that during this time, everyone in the administration was pleading for more equipment. but when azar requested $4 billion to stock up, the white house refused. trump dismissed the outcry for masks and ridiculed democrats for “forcing money” on him to buy supplies. “they say, ‘oh, he should do more,’ ” the president scoffed in an interview on feb. 28. “there’s nothing more you can do.”

the third and most important step was to test the population to see whether the virus was spreading domestically. that was the policy of south korea, the global leader in case detection. like the united states, south korea had identified its first case on jan. 20. but from there, the two countries diverged. by feb. 3 south korea had expanded its testing program, and by feb. 27 it was checking samples from more than 10,000 people a day. the u.s. program, hampered by malfunctions and bureaucratic conflict, was nowhere near that. by mid-february, it was testing only about 100 samples a day. as a result, few infections were being detected.

fauci saw this as a grave vulnerability. from feb. 14 to march 11, he warned in a dozen hearings, forums, and interviews that the virus might be spreading “under the radar.” but trump wasn’t interested. he liked having a low infection count—he bragged about it at rallies—and he understood that the official count would stay low if people weren’t tested. trump had been briefed on the testing situation since late january and knew test production was delayed. but he insisted that “anybody that wants a test can get a test” and that “the tests are all perfect.” later, he brushed off the delay in test production and said it had been “quickly remedied.” he complained that additional tests, by exposing additional cases, made him “look bad.”

to keep the numbers low, trump was willing to risk lives. he figured that infections didn’t count if they were offshore, so he tried to prevent infected americans from setting foot on american soil. in mid-february, even as he refused to bar europeans from entering the united states, he exploded in anger when more than a dozen infected americans were allowed to return from japan. “i hated to do it, statistically,” he told hannity. “you know, is it going to look bad?” in march, he opposed a decision to let passengers off a cruise ship in california. “i’d rather have the people stay” offshore, he explained, “because i like the numbers being where they are. i don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship.”

when the spread of the virus in the united states could no longer be denied, trump called it the “invisible enemy.” but trump had kept it invisible. the cdc would later acknowledge that due to woefully insufficient testing, the overwhelming majority of infections had gone undiagnosed. models would show that by mid-february, there were hundreds of undetected infections in the united states for every known case. by the end of the month, there were thousands.

trump didn’t just ignore warnings. he suppressed them. when azar briefed him about the virus in january, trump called him an “alarmist” and told him to stop panicking. when navarro submitted a memo about the oncoming pandemic, trump said he shouldn’t have put his words in writing. as the stock market rose in february, trump discouraged aides from saying anything about the virus that might scare investors.

the president now casts himself as a victim of chinese deception. in reality, he collaborated with xi to deceive both the chinese public and the american public. for weeks after he was briefed on the situation in china, including the fact that beijing was downplaying the crisis, trump continued to deny that the chinese government was hiding anything. he implied that american experts had been welcomed in china and could vouch for beijing’s information, which—as he would acknowledge months later—wasn’t true. on twitter, trump wrote tributes worthy of chinese state propaganda. “great discipline is taking place in china, as president xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation,” he proclaimed.

on feb. 10, just before a rally in new hampshire, trump told fox news host trish regan that the chinese “have everything under control. … we’re working with them. you know, we just sent some of our best people over there.” then trump walked onstage and exploited the political payoff of his deal with xi. “last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with china that will defeat so many of our opponents,” he boasted. he told the crowd that he had spoken with xi and that the virus situation would “work out fine.” “by april,” he explained, “in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.”

trump didn’t tell the crowd that he had heard this theory from xi. but that’s what the record indicates. there’s no evidence of trump peddling the warm-weather theory prior to feb. 7, when he had an overnight phone call with xi. immediately after that call, trump began to promote the idea. later, he mentioned that xi had said it. when fauci, messonnier, azar, and redfield were asked about the theory, they all said it was an unwise assumption, since the virus was new. the american president, against the judgment of his public health officials, was feeding american citizens a false assurance passed to him by the chinese president.

three days after the rally in new hampshire, trump defended china’s censorship of information about the virus. in a radio interview, geraldo rivera asked him, “did the chinese tell the truth about this?” trump, in reply, suggested that he would have done what xi had done. “i think they want to put the best face on it,” he said. “if you were running it … you wouldn’t want to run out to the world and go crazy and start saying whatever it is, ’cause you don’t want to create a panic.” weeks later, trump would also excuse chinese disinformation about the virus, telling fox news viewers that “every country does it.”

trump envied xi. he wished he could control what americans heard and thought, the way xi could control china’s government and media. but trump didn’t have authoritarian powers, and some of his subordinates wouldn’t shut up. as the virus moved from country to country, fauci, redfield, and azar began to acknowledge that it would soon overtake the united states. on feb. 25, when messonnier said americans should prepare for school and workplace closures, the stock market plunged. trump, in a rage, called azar and threatened to fire messonnier. the next day, the president seized control of the administration’s press briefings on the virus.

on feb. 26, shortly before trump held his first briefing, aides gave him bad news: the cdc had just confirmed the first u.s. infection that couldn’t be traced to foreign travel. that meant the virus was spreading undetected. but when trump took the podium, he didn’t mention what he had just been told. instead, he assured the public that infections in the united states were “going down, not up” and that the case count “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” he predicted that america wouldn’t “ever be anywhere near” having to close schools or distribute more masks, since “our borders are very controlled.” when a reporter pointed out that the united states had tested fewer than 500 people, while south korea had tested tens of thousands, trump shot back, “we’re testing everybody that we need to test. and we’re finding very little problem.”

“we’re testing everybody that we need to test. and we’re finding very little problem.” — trump, feb. 26

trump’s eruption brought his subordinates into line. shortly after the president’s angry call to azar, redfield told congress that “our containment strategy has been quite successful.” at her next briefing, for the first time, messonnier praised trump by name. she parroted his talking points: that the united states had “acted incredibly quickly, before most other countries” and had “aggressively controlled our borders.” azar, in testimony before the house, went further. when he was asked to explain the discord between trump and his medical advisers, the health secretary argued that americans, like citizens of china, needed to be soothed. the president, azar explained, was “trying to calm” the populace because, as “we see in china, panic can be as big of an enemy as [the] virus.”

having cowed his health officials, trump next went after the press. he told americans to ignore news reports about the virus. on feb. 26 and feb. 27, trump denounced cnn and msnbc for “panicking markets” by making the crisis “look as bad as possible.” he dismissed their reports as “fake” and tweeted, “usa in great shape!” at a rally in south carolina on feb. 28, he accused the press of “hysteria,” called criticism of his virus policies a “hoax,” and insisted that only 15 americans were infected. weeks later, he would tell the public not to believe u.s. media reports about chinese propaganda, either.

in the three weeks after his feb. 26 crackdown on his subordinates, trump opposed or obstructed every response to the crisis. doctors were pleading for virus tests and other equipment. without enough tests to sample the population or screen people with symptoms, the virus was spreading invisibly. fauci was desperate to accelerate the production and distribution of tests, but trump said it wasn’t necessary. on a march 6 visit to the cdc, the president argued that instead of “going out and proactively looking to see where there’s a problem,” it was better to “find out those areas just by sitting back and waiting.” a proactive cdc testing program, lacking presidential support, never got off the ground. nor did a separate national testing plan—organized by trump’s son-in-law, jared kushner—which was supposed to be presented for trump’s approval but, for unknown reasons, was never announced.

“i shake anybody’s hand now. i’m proud of it.” — trump, march 5

trump also refused to invoke the defense production act, which could have accelerated the manufacture of masks, gloves, ventilators, and other emergency equipment. in january, hhs had begun to plan for use of the dpa, and in early february, some members of congress suggested it might be needed. but trump declined to use it until the end of march. when he was asked why, he said that governors, not the president, were responsible for emergency supplies and that telling “companies what to do” might upset the “business community.”

the president’s most decisive contribution to the death toll was his resistance to public health measures known as “mitigation”: social distancing, school and workplace closures, and cancellations of large gatherings. messonnier and others had warned since early february that americans needed to prepare for such measures. on feb. 24, trump’s health advisers decided it was time to act. but they couldn’t get a meeting with trump, because he was off to india to discuss another trade deal. when he returned, he blew up at messonnier for talking about closing schools and offices. the meeting to discuss mitigation was canceled.

mitigation required leadership. the president needed to tell americans that the crisis was urgent and that life had to change. instead, he told them everything was fine. on march 2, he held another rally, this time in north carolina. before the rally, a tv interviewer asked him whether he was taking more precautions because of the virus. “probably not so much,” trump replied. “i just shook hands with a whole lot of people back there.” the next day, he said it was safe to travel across the country, since “there’s only one hot spot.” on march 5, at a fox news town hall, he repeated, “i shake anybody’s hand now. i’m proud of it.” on march 6, visiting the cdc, he was asked about the risks of packing people together at rallies. “it doesn’t bother me at all,” he said.

as schools and businesses began to close, trump pushed back. on march 4, he dismissed a question about further closures, insisting that only “a very small number” of americans were infected. on march 9, he tweeted that the virus had hardly killed anyone and that even in bad flu seasons, “nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on.” italy locked down its population, the nba suspended its season, and states began to postpone elections. but through the middle of march, as advisers urged the president to endorse mitigation, he stood his ground. finally, as the stock market continued to fall, trump’s business friends agreed that it was time to yield. on march 16, he announced mitigation guidelines.

by then, the number of confirmed infections in the united states had surged past 4,000. but that was a fraction of the real number. the cdc would later calculate that in the three weeks from “late february to early march, the number of u.s. covid-19 cases increased more than 1,000-fold.” and researchers at columbia university would find that the final two-week delay in mitigation, from march 1 to march 15, had multiplied the u.s. death toll by a factor of six. by may 3, the price of that delay was more than 50,000 lives.

on march 23, a week after he announced the mitigation guidelines, trump began pushing to rescind them. “we have to open our country,” he demanded. he batted away questions about the opinions of his medical advisers. “if it were up to the doctors, they may say, ‘let’s keep it shut down,’ ” he shrugged. but “you can’t do that with a country, especially the no. 1 economy.” the next day, the stock market soared, and trump took credit. investors “see that we want to get our country open as soon as possible,” he crowed.

trump fixated on the market and the election. in more than a dozen tweets, briefings, and interviews, he explicitly connected his chances of reelection to the speed at which schools and businesses reopened. (trump focused on schools only after he was told that they were crucial to resuming commerce.) the longer it took, he warned, the better democrats would do in the election. in april, he applauded states that opened early and hectored states that kept businesses closed. in june, he told workers in maine, “you’re missing a lot of money.” “why isn’t your governor opening up your state?” he asked them.

trump pushed states to reopen businesses even where, under criteria laid out by his health officials, it wasn’t safe to do so. he called for “pressure” and endorsed lawsuits against governors who resisted. he issued an executive order to keep meat-processing plants open, despite thousands of infections among plant employees. he ordered the cdc to publish rules allowing churches to reopen, and he vowed to “override any governor” who kept them closed. in april, he made the cdc withdraw an indefinite ban on cruises, which had spread the virus. in july, he pressed the agency to loosen its guidelines for reopening schools.

“why isn’t your governor opening up your state?” — trump, june 5

he continued to suppress warnings. in april, he claimed that doctors who reported shortages of supplies were faking it. when an acting inspector general released a report that showed supplies were inadequate, trump dismissed the report and replaced her. when a navy captain wrote a letter seeking help for his infected crew, trump endorsed the captain’s demotion. the letter “shows weakness,” he said. “we don’t want to have letter-writing campaigns where the fake news finds a letter or gets a leak.”

having argued in march against testing, trump now complained that doctors were testing too many people. he said tests, by revealing infections, made him “look bad.” when fauci and deborah birx, the response coordinator for the white house coronavirus task force, said more tests were needed, trump openly contradicted them. in july, he claimed that 99 percent of coronavirus infections were “totally harmless”—which wasn’t true—and that the testing system, by detecting these infections, was “working too well.”

fauci, birx, redfield, and other health officials pointed out that mitigation was working. they argued against premature resumption of in-person social activities, noting that the virus wasn’t under control and might roar back. trump publicly overruled them, tried to discredit them, and pressured them to disavow their words. to block fauci from disputing trump’s assurances that the virus was “going away,” the white house barred him from doing most tv interviews. in june, when fauci said resuming professional football would be risky, trump rebuked him. “informed dr. fauci this morning that he has nothing to do with nfl football,” the president tweeted.

trump interfered with every part of the government’s response. he told governors that testing for the virus was their job, not his. when they asked for help in getting supplies, he told them to “get ’em yourself.” he refused, out of pique, to speak to house speaker nancy pelosi or to some governors whose states were overrun by the virus. he told vice president mike pence not to speak to them, either. he refused to consult former presidents, calling them failures and saying he had nothing to learn from them.

trump didn’t just get in the way. he made things worse. he demanded that wisconsin hold elections in early april, which coincided with dozens of infections among voters and poll workers. (some researchers later found correlations between infections and voting in that election; others didn’t.) he forced west point to summon cadets, 15 of whom were infected, back to campus to attend his commencement speech in june. he suggested that the virus could be killed by injecting disinfectants. he persistently urged americans to take hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, despite research that found it was ineffective against the coronavirus and in some cases could be dangerous. trump dismissed the research as “phony.”

the simplest way to control the virus was to wear face coverings. but instead of encouraging this precaution, trump ridiculed masks. he said they could cause infections, and he applauded people who spurned them. polls taken in late may, as the virus began to spread across the sun belt, indicated that trump’s scorn was suppressing mask use. a morning consult survey found that the top predictor of non-use of masks, among dozens of factors tested, was support for trump. an nbc news/wall street journal survey found that people who seldom or never wore masks were 12 times more likely to support trump than to support his opponent, former vice president joe biden. some scientific models imply that trump’s suppression of mask use may have contributed to hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths.

on june 10, trump announced that he would resume holding political rallies. he targeted four states: florida, texas, arizona, and oklahoma. the point of the rallies, he explained, wasn’t just to boost his campaign but to signal that it was time to “open up our country” and “get back to business.” when reporters raised the possibility that he might spread the virus by drawing crowds indoors, he accused them of “trying to covid shame us on our big rallies.”

despite being warned that infections in oklahoma were surging, trump proceeded with a rally at a tulsa arena on june 20. to encourage social distance, the arena’s managers put “do not sit here” stickers on alternate seats. the trump campaign removed the stickers. trump also refused to wear a mask at the rally—few people in the crowd did, either—and in his speech, he bragged about continuing to shake children’s hands. two weeks later, tulsa broke its record for daily infections, and the city’s health director said the rally was partly to blame. former presidential candidate herman cain attended the rally, tested positive for the virus days afterward, and died at the end of july.

at the rally, trump complained that health care workers were finding too many infections by testing people for the virus. he said he had told “my people” to “slow the testing down, please.” aides insisted that the president was joking. but on june 22, in an interview with the christian broadcasting network, he said he was only half-joking. he affirmed, this time seriously, that he had told “my people” that testing was largely frivolous and bad for america’s image. weeks later, officials involved in negotiations on capitol hill disclosed that the administration, against the wishes of senate republicans, was trying to block funding for virus tests.

two days after the tulsa rally, an interviewer asked trump whether he was putting lives at risk “by continuing to hold these indoor events.” trump brushed off the question: “i’m not worried about it. no, not at all.” the next day, june 23, the president staged another largely mask-free rally, this time in a church in arizona, where a statewide outbreak was underway. days later, secret service agents and a speaker at the arizona rally tested positive for the virus. on june 28, trump urged people to attend another rally, this time featuring pence, at a dallas church where five choir and orchestra members had tested positive.

in his interview with wallace, which aired july 19, trump conceded nothing. he called fauci an alarmist and repeated that the virus would “disappear.” he excoriated governors for “not allowing me to have rallies” and accused them of keeping businesses closed to hurt him in the election. he claimed that “masks cause problems” and said people should feel free not to wear them. he threatened to defund schools unless they resumed in-class instruction. as to the rising number of infections, trump scoffed that “many of those cases shouldn’t even be cases,” since they would “heal automatically.” by testing so many people, he groused, health care workers were “creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, ‘oh, we have more cases.’ ”

“many of those cases heal automatically. … we’re creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, ‘oh, we have more cases.’ ” — trump, july 17

since that interview, trump has attacked and belittled his medical advisers. he lashed out at birx for acknowledging the ongoing spread of the virus. he retweeted a false claim that fauci was suppressing hydroxychloroquine “to perpetuate covid deaths to hurt trump.” when fauci told congress that infections had increased due to insufficient mitigation, trump rebuked him and blamed the surge on increased testing. and when dave portnoy, a wealthy trump supporter, complained that his stocks tanked every time fauci called for mitigation, trump assured portnoy that the doctor’s pleas would go nowhere. “he’d like to see [the economy] closed up for a couple of years,” trump said of fauci. “but that’s ok, because i’m president. so i say, ‘i appreciate your opinion. now somebody give me another opinion.’ ”

it’s hard to believe a president could be this callous and corrupt. it’s hard to believe one person could get so many things wrong or do so much damage. but that’s what happened. trump knew we weren’t ready for a pandemic, but he didn’t prepare. he knew china was hiding the extent of the crisis, but he joined in the cover-up. he knew the virus was spreading in the united states, but he said it was vanishing. he knew we wouldn’t find it without more tests, but he said we didn’t need them. he delayed mitigation. he derided masks. he tried to silence anyone who told the truth. and in the face of multiple warnings, he pushed the country back open, reigniting the spread of the disease.

now trump asks us to reelect him. “we had the greatest economy in the history of the world,” he told fox news on wednesday. “then we got hit with the plague from china.” but now, he promised, “we’re building it again.” in trump’s story, the virus is a foreign intrusion, an unpleasant interlude, a stroke of bad luck. but when you stand back and look at the full extent of his role in the catastrophe, it’s amazing how lucky we were. for three years, we survived the most ruthless, reckless, dishonest president in american history. then our luck ran out."

beirut (ap) — lebanon’s prime minister stepped down from his job monday in the wake of the catastrophic explosion in beirut that has triggered public outrage, saying he has come to the conclusion that corruption in the country is “bigger than the state.”

the move risks opening the way to dragged-out negotiations over a new cabinet amid urgent calls for reform. it follows a weekend of anti-government protests after the aug. 4 explosion in beirut’s port that decimated the facility and caused widespread destruction, killing at least 160 people and injuring about 6,000 others.

in a brief televised speech after three of his ministers resigned, prime minister hassan diab said he and his government were stepping down.

“may god protect lebanon,” he said, repeating the last phrase three times. as he spoke, protesters demonstrated in the streets near parliament for a third straight day.

the moment typified lebanon’s political dilemma. since october, there have been mass demonstrations demanding the departure of the entire sectarian-based leadership over entrenched corruption, incompetence and mismanagement.

but the ruling oligarchy has held onto power for so long — since the end of the civil war in 1990 — that it is difficult to find a credible political figure untainted by connections to it.

diab blamed corrupt politicians who preceded him for the “earthquake” that has hit lebanon.

“they (the political class) should have been ashamed of themselves because their corruption is what has led to this disaster that had been hidden for seven years,” he added.

“i have discovered that corruption is bigger than the state and that the state is paralyzed by this (ruling) clique and cannot confront it or get rid of it,” said diab, who was a professor at the american university of beirut before he took the job.

after the catastrophe, diab had sought to stay on for two months to organize new parliamentary elections and allow a map for reforms. but the pressure from within his own cabinet proved to be too much. with the mass resignation, the call for early elections appears dead, so the same factions will debate on forming a new cabinet.

diab’s government was formed after his predecessor, saad hariri, stepped down in october in response to the demonstrations. it took months of bickering among the leadership factions before they settled on diab.

his government, which was dominated by the hezbollah militant group and its allies and seen as one-sided, was basically doomed from the start, tasked with meeting demands for reform but made up of all the factions that reformers want out.

now the process must start again.

“i hope that the caretaking period will not be long because the country cannot take that. lets hope a new government will be formed quickly,” public works minister michel najjar said. “an effective government is the least we need to get out of this crisis.”

the pressure from the streets — and from french president emmanuel macron, who visited beirut last week after the blast — could push the political factions to put aside their differences and form a unity government. diab’s government largely excluded hezbollah’s opponents, the eurasia group said in an analysis, adding that the factions may now see the need to carry out greater reform.

the group said a government of independent experts could be created, although hezbollah is a main obstacle to that since it fears that would eventually lead to the group being forced out of the political system.

the weekend protests saw clashes with security forces firing tear gas at demonstrators.

the explosion is believed to have been caused by a fire that ignited a 2,750-ton stockpile of highly volatile ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the port since 2013 with few safeguards despite numerous warnings of the danger.

the result was a disaster that the lebanese people blame squarely on their leadership’s corruption and neglect. losses from the explosion are estimated at $10 billion to $15 billion, with nearly 300,000 people left homeless.

on monday, a french chemical expert working at the shattered port told the associated press that his team is working to secure at least 20 potentially dangerous chemical containers there after finding one that was leaking.

he also said there are flammable liquids in other containers as well as batteries and other products that could increase the risk of an explosion, describing huge containers tossed around the port by the powerful blast. the expert identified himself only as lt. anthony in accordance with french government policy.

the last decision by diab’s government before its resignation was to refer the case of the explosion to the supreme judicial council, which handles crimes infringing on lebanon’s national security as well as political and state security crimes. the supreme judicial council is lebanon’s top judicial body.

a judge on monday questioned the heads of the country’s security agencies. public prosecutor ghassan el khoury questioned maj. gen. tony saliba, the head of state security, according to state-run national news agency. it gave no further details, but other generals are scheduled to be questioned.

state security had compiled a report about the dangers of storing the material at the port and sent a copy to the offices of the president and prime minister on july 20. the investigation is focused on how the ammonium nitrate came to be stored at the port and why nothing was done about it.

najjar, the public works minister, said he learned about the material’s presence 24 hours before the blast, receiving a report about the material and holding a meeting with port officials before calling its chief, hassan korayetem.

“i wrote a report in the morning the explosion happened in the evening,” najjar said. asked why he only learned of it the day before, najjar said, “i don’t know. truly i don’t know.”

about 20 people have been detained after the blast, including the head of lebanon’s customs department and his predecessor, as well as the head of the port. dozens of people have been questioned, including two former cabinet ministers, according to government officials.

on sunday, world leaders and international organizations pledged nearly $300 million in emergency humanitarian aid to beirut, but warned that no money for rebuilding the capital would be made available until lebanese authorities commit themselves to the political and economic reforms demanded by the people."

list of towns with delayed letters town letters delayed

denmark 2,800 sebago 3,600 brownfield 2,800 lovell 2,400 fryeburg 12,000 bridgton 11,600 naples 9,200 harrison 5,200 waterford 3,600 casco 6,400 cornish/hiram 5,600 limington/steep falls 8,000 parsonsfield/porter 7,200 total 80,400 source: american postal workers union local 458

rather than wait an extra 10 minutes for the mail to be ready, the trucks left the postal service’s southern maine processing and distribution center in scarborough exactly on time monday morning, leaving behind roughly 80,400 letters that will be delivered late as a result, said scott adams, general president of the american postal workers union local 458. he estimated the processing center sorts approximately one million pieces of mail on a typical sunday night.

adams sent the portland press herald information monday morning outlining the amount of delayed mail broken down by destination. he said all the letters left behind had been sorted the previous night and just needed to be loaded onto mail carriers’ trucks for delivery.

a postal service spokesman said monday evening that the union’s 80,000 figure was overblown. he also said the delayed letters were distributed later in the day and were not held until tuesday.

“this mail was dispatched on the next available scheduled transportation heading to 10 impacted post offices,” said steve doherty, strategic communications specialist for the postal service’s northeast region. “in those offices, all mail was sorted to the customer post office boxes. six post offices also had some mail for rural delivery and we have made every effort to complete delivery through the carriers as well. this midday volume did not reflect the majority of the day’s mail for these offices. however, we remain committed to making every effort to effect today’s delivery for these customers and apologize for any concern.”

adams acknowledged in a follow-up statement that his figures for delayed mail could be inflated by 20 percent or so, but he said quibbling over the numbers is beside the point.

“management is upset that our numbers are inaccurate,” he said. “however, they’re missing the point. whether an arsonist burns eight buildings, rather than 10, matters not.”

on thursday, sen. angus king of maine, an independent, said he has received a barrage of correspondence from constituents concerned about the financial stability of the postal service and worried it may not be up to the task of handling the large number of mail-in ballots that are likely to flood post offices as the nov. 3 general election approaches.

king emphasized in a letter to sen. gary peters, d-michigan, the ranking member on the senate’s committee on homeland security and governmental affairs, which oversees postal service operations, that it is an essential service and should not be run like a for-profit business.

in july, several letter carriers accused portland’s postmaster of deliberately delaying the delivery of first-class and priority mail by ordering clerks to sort amazon packages first, ensuring that carriers deliver them on time.

the fryeburg and bridgton routes were the hardest hit by monday’s delay. the union estimated – 12,000 and 11,600 pieces of mail were delayed in each town, respectively.

“i walked into my post office, and we didn’t have any … sorted letters for us, and (were) told we probably wouldn’t be getting them today,” said a carrier in fryeburg who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution. “the guy who drove our truck told our clerk that they were told the letters weren’t ready yet – ‘just go.'”

the order for the trucks to leave came from one of the managers at the plant, adams said. he did not name the manager.

in the past, trucks would have waited the extra 10 minutes until the mail was ready, which makes little difference to postal service customers, adams said. however, according to rules from new postmaster general louis dejoy, there must be “no late trips; no extra trips,” in an effort to save money, he said.

“we’re going to have delayed mail – the process changes where they say, ‘no late mail,'” adams said. “the whole process is going to take an extra day when they do this. so, obviously, it’s a change in service standards.”

the new regulations are evidence that dejoy is trying to run the postal service like a business, adams said. the service has come under immense pressure to make itself financially viable following a move by congress in 2009 to force it to pre-fund decades worth of health care costs for pensioners.

the agency is struggling to handle a surge in online shopping deliveries while trying to cut costs by limiting overtime and reducing extra trips, both of which were ordered by dejoy. he already has come under scrutiny for new policies that normalize delivering mail late in exchange for cutting overtime.

“to say, ‘this is the way it’s going to be,’ set in stone, black and white – that doesn’t work. we have to be flexible,” adams said. “and i think the postmaster general looks at this as a business. you know, it’s not (a business), it’s a service. so we have to make a few adjustments to get 80,400 pieces of mail out to the customers, which were due today.”

adams said he was frustrated that in addition to slowing down mail delivery, the postal service isn’t taking responsibility for it. he said the late mail, which customers often can track, doesn’t get marked as “delayed,” and as a result, customers are left waiting for mail that won’t be delivered for another day.

he also noted that several employees were kept working over 12 hours at the plant sunday night to sort the mail, resulting in several hours of double pay. despite the costly effort to get the mail sorted in time, it was left behind.

the carrier in fryeburg, whose route was timed at eight hours, said it would likely take only six hours monday, meaning a loss of two hours in pay.

“tomorrow, i’m sure there’s going to be a lot of people who are … going to be wondering where everything was,” the carrier said.

carriers will have to sort any delayed letters manually on tuesday morning, the union said. a machine at the scarborough distribution center sorts the mail into a delivery point sequence so that carriers can deliver mail directly from presorted stacks. but with two days of mail sorted separately, there will be two different stacks of mail for each delivery point.

“tomorrow morning, carriers are going to have two sets of sequenced letters, and they can’t carry (the mail) that way,” adams said. “the machine did the work, and now they have to undo what the machine did to put it in the case.”

Coronavirus: First outbreak in New Zealand after 102 days sees Auckland put into lockdown,114,i7q4sp,https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-breaks-out-again-in-new-zealand-after-102-days-12047011,7,1597174280.0,,"coronavirus has broken out again in new zealand after more than 100 days and prompted the country's government to put its largest city into strict lockdown.

prime minister jacinda ardern on tuesday said four people from one family in south auckland were found to have contracted covid-19.

these are the first new cases of locally-acquired coronavirus after new zealand went 102 days without any domestic transmission.

image: auckland will move to 'level three' restrictions following the outbreak

in response, auckland, on new zealand's north island, will be placed into ""level three"" restrictions from midday on wednesday.

local residents are being told by ms ardern to ""stay home to stop the spread"" of the disease and ""act as if you have covid, and as if the people around you have covid"".

those in auckland are being urged to work from home and only leave their houses for ""essential movements"" such as going to the supermarket or local park.

but ms ardern urged against panic-buying at supermarkets on tuesday night.

schools and nurseries will close to pupils apart from the children of key workers, while gatherings of more than ten people will be restricted.

bars and restaurants are also being told to close, while travel into and out of auckland will be restricted to those returning home to the city, or those leaving who live elsewhere.

police are due to issue further information on the use of roadblocks around auckland on wednesday.

image: jacinda ardern said new zealand had learned to 'go hard and go early' with restrictions

announcing the restrictions will be in place for three days until midnight on friday, ms ardern said: ""one of the most important lessons we've learned from overseas is the need to go hard and go early.

""and stamp out flare-ups to avoid the risk of wider outbreak.

""as disruptive as it is, a strong and rapid health response remains the best long-term economic response.

""in line with our precautionary approach, we will be asking aucklanders to take swift action with us.""

she added: ""these three days will give us time to assess the situation, gather information, make sure we have widespread contact tracing so we can find out more about how this case arose and make decisions on how to respond to it once we have further information.""

the rest of new zealand will be moved to ""level two"" restrictions from midday on wednesday, ms ardern announced.

earlier on tuesday, the new zealand herald newspaper reported a retirement village in christchurch, the largest city on the country's south island, had gone into lockdown after residents displayed symptoms of respiratory illness.

in other developments, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world has reached 20 million.

the milestone - based on a count by the johns hopkins university, which has been tracking the development of the pandemic - was reached in the early hours of tuesday.

experts believe the real figure of worldwide cases is much higher due to testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of people infected have no symptoms."
Five Ways Trump And GOP Officials Are Undermining The Election Process,103,i7safq,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/five-ways-trump-and-gop-officials-are-undermining-the-election-process/,47,1597183058.0,,"there has long been conflict in the united states over who gets to vote and how. in the years since barack obama’s election as president, those voting debates have become increasingly partisan, with republican elected officials often pushing measures like requiring photo ids that make it harder for people to vote, and democratic officials advancing provisions like same-day registration that make it easier to vote.

that long-running conflict over voting has reached a new, more critical phase for two reasons. first, the outbreak of covid-19 means that people might be risking their health if they opt to vote in person. secondly, donald trump, unlike previous presidents, regularly breaks with democratic norms and values and is now openly suggesting that he might manipulate the electoral system to help him win a second term.

“trump aides exploring executive actions to curb voting by mail,” was the headline of an article in politico last weekend (that was a news article, not an opinion piece). politico’s reporting found that the white house was considering using executive actions to insert itself into the election process, which is usually run by states, including finding ways to make it harder for people to vote by mail.

i think it’s totally appropriate for people to, well, freak out about the potential undermining of the electoral process by trump and his allies. that said, there is now a flurry of lawsuits, judicial rulings, decisions by election officials at the local and state levels, and claims of voter fraud and voter suppression that can be a bit of minefield to wade through. it’s a lot and it can get confusing.

so to better understand what’s a really big deal versus something that might be problematic but perhaps not as important, we broke out the potential ways that trump and the gop could limit voting or undermine the electoral process into five general tactics. these tactics are roughly ordered from least to most alarming. this is not any kind of formal legal guide, although we consulted with some experts for this piece, and some of those experts have law degrees. this analysis also includes some details of the democrats’ approach to voting rights issues. but we opted to focus on the republicans because their approach is more controversial than the democratic one (which is largely to make it easier to vote) and because perhaps the most important figure in the current voting wars is the republican president.

here are the tactics:

1. opposing changes to make it easier to vote amid covid-19

a lot of the litigation around voting this year pits groups allied with liberal-leaning parts of the electorate, like the naacp legal defense and educational fund (ldf) and lawyers affiliated with the democratic party, against officials in charge of administering elections (secretaries of state, for example). in these cases, the litigants are trying to get judges to change or invalidate existing laws and force officials to make it easier for americans to vote and have their vote counted.

the litigants often invoke the pandemic in demanding these changes, but they are changes in the voting process that these litigants would likely prefer outside of the covid-19 context, too. for example, the ldf and the southern poverty law center are trying to get struck down a requirement in alabama that voters include a copy of their photo id with their application for an absentee ballot. getting a copy of your photo id does potentially increase your chances of getting covid-19, their brief argues. but the ldf opposed provisions requiring people to present photo ids as part of the voting process well before the coronavirus pandemic.

marc elias, a leading democratic election attorney, is filing lawsuits in more than two dozen states (including basically every key swing state), to enforce his “four pillars” for mail-in voting in the 2020 election:

the government prepays the postage for mail-in ballots. ballots postmarked before or on election day are counted (as opposed to counting only ballots received by election day). signature requirements for mail-in ballots are administered in a voter-friendly way. (elias suggests requiring election officials across the country to contact voters before their ballots are ruled invalid because the signature on the ballot does not match the signature election officials have on file.) individuals or groups are allowed to collect the ballots of people and turn them in (to ease voting for people who might not have easy access to mail services).

liberal-leaning lawyers like elias are losing some of these cases in court (or at least not getting all the accommodations that they want), with republicans — including the trump campaign — filing briefs opposing changes that might make it easier for americans to vote and have their vote counted. it’s not ideal that republicans are taking this tack, as the right to vote is so important. and the gop often uses false or misleading rhetoric to oppose measures making voting easier, such as dubbing efforts by groups to collect and turn in mail-in ballots “ballot harvesting” and suggesting, without evidence, that the process will lead to widespread voter fraud.

that said, we cast this tactic as the least problematic one republicans are employing because there are instances of republicans opposing new steps to make voting easier, rather than creating new barriers to voting. also, even most blue states don’t currently have all four of elias’s pillars in place. only seven states (california, colorado, hawaii, nevada, oregon, utah and washington) got “a” ratings for their vote-by-mail systems in a recent brookings institute report.

2. seeking to invalidate laws that make it easier to vote amid covid-19

during the pandemic, some states, particularly those run by democrats, are taking affirmative steps to make it much easier to vote. for example, california and nevada are planning to send mail-in ballots to all the registered voters in their states. election officials in pennsylvania have set up boxes for people to drop off their absentee ballots, as opposed to requiring all voters to send them through the mail.

the trump campaign is filing lawsuits to stop the moves in nevada, pennsylvania and other states. the republican national committee (which is tightly aligned with the trump campaign) is involved in litigation in 17 states, again including virtually every battleground state, to enforce its voting agenda, which includes:

requiring ballots to be received by election day. keeping current photo id and signature laws in place. opposing people or groups being able to turn in mail-in ballots of other voters. opposing newly enacted plans to allow basically all voters in a given state to vote by mail.

you can see why this is more problematic in terms of democratic values than the previous category: local and state officials are taking affirmative steps to make it easier for americans to vote and have their vote counted amid a pandemic and the sitting president’s campaign is trying to reverse those decisions.

for this category, the actions of the five justices on the u.s. supreme court appointed by republican presidents are likely to be particularly important. in all four of the most recent supreme court decisions on voting rights issues, the court’s conservative majority rejected attempts by liberal litigants to get existing law changed to make it easier to vote amid covid-19 (the first category we listed above). those rulings have infuriated liberals, but i can’t say that i’m surprised by them — chief justice john roberts regularly votes both to uphold existing legal precedents and to show deference to the judgements of local officials and other branches of government in ways that sometimes align with the more liberal justices and other times with the court’s conservatives. so it would be more surprising (and alarming) if roberts and the high court struck down new laws, like those in california, making it easier to vote.

3. advancing new practices and provisions that make it harder to vote

this tactic refers to moves like rolling back the number of early voting days in a state or making it harder for students to vote. these are all strategies that republicans have employed pre-covid-19. republicans aren’t rolling out a lot of new provisions to make it harder to vote in 2020 because they already passed a lot of them from 2011 to 2018, and they couldn’t pass a lot of them in 2019 and 2020. (democrats made a lot of gains at the state level in 2018, and it would have been controversial to adopt such measures after the virus outbreak.)

but republicans are trying two new strategies, with liberals seeking to get each struck down by courts. first, in florida specifically, republicans are complicating the process for ex-felons who have served their sentences to regain their voting rights, despite a 2018 ballot initiative, supported by 65 percent of florida voters, that was intended to do just that. and in states around the country, gop officials are planning to send an unusually large number of people to individual voting locations as “poll watchers.” poll watchers have been used by both parties. but the rhetoric about voter fraud from fox news and trump in particular creates the potential for gop poll watchers to show up at voting places specifically to look for voters they might view as both illegitimate and liberal-leaning (people of color and people around age 18 in particular) and push for the officials running those polling locations to more closely scrutinize those voters.

i view this category as particularly problematic, in terms of democratic values, because it raises the specter of people facing increased difficulty voting in large part because they are perceived to likely to oppose republican candidates. (the ex-felons who would be newly eligible to vote in florida are disproportionately black.)

4. anti-democratic rhetoric

what i’m talking about here is largely rhetoric that has no direct impact, but has the potential to undermine confidence in the election system. think about trump’s comments about potentially changing the day of the election or the unfounded suggestions by the president, attorney general william barr and other conservatives that mail-in voting will lead to fraud.

how this tactic affects the election depends on two factors. first, do other members of the republican party, such as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, echo trump’s rhetoric, thereby creating a situation where one of the country’s two major political parties is questioning the electoral system? and second, do gop elected officials start acting on this rhetoric, such as trying to roll back existing vote-by-mail programs or not counting ballots received after election day in states where it is legal to count them?

in other words, this kind of rhetoric presents two potential risks, undermining the public’s confidence in the legitimacy of the election and — if the rhetoric leads to action — literally compromising the legitimacy of the election.

5. fundamental changes to the electoral process

speaking of actually compromising the election … the recent changes at the u.s. postal service that are slowing down mail delivery across the country are arguably the biggest threat to the american election system in 2020. if mail delivery continues to be slowed down, that creates two very important potential problems. first, in states where ballots must be received by officials before election day (33, according to the national conference of state legislatures), a slowed-down mail system could disenfranchise thousands and perhaps even millions of people. secondly, a slower system creates the potential for a ton of ballots to arrive either just before, on or after election day, meaning that the counting of votes might stretch on for days or weeks and americans wouldn’t know the winner of the presidential election for a long time. that’s not ideal in any circumstances, but particularly with a president like trump who can’t be expected to wait for election results before trying to declare himself the winner.

postmaster general louis dejoy, a longtime gop donor who has given more than $2 million over the last few years to trump’s campaign and other republican causes, says the changes he has made since taking his post in june are intended to reduce the usps’s spending and make it more cost-efficient. i don’t have any proof he is lying, but it’s also doubtful that dejoy would be candid about it if his real goal was complicating vote-by-mail systems and helping trump win. either way, it’s a strange decision to overhaul the mailing system in a way that appears to be making it harder to send things through usps quickly when the u.s. will be relying on the postal service more than ever before as part of the electoral process.

and if trump followed through on changing the day of the election (which he cannot do on his own) or limiting vote by mail, those changes would go into this category as well.

it’s worth thinking about these categories both in terms of the horse race and in terms of broader questions of democratic norms and values. the first three are problematic in terms of democratic norms and values because republicans seem to be intentionally making it harder for people to vote. and if this race gets tighter, those moves could prove decisive. if we reach the later stages of the campaign and polls still show biden with a clear lead nationally and in most swing states, it’s less likely that these tactics would literally swing the election. (then again, we haven’t really faced a situation like this before.)

on the other hand, the last two categories are huge, both in terms of democratic values and electoral repercussions. if people’s mail-in ballots aren’t received until way after election day, and trump and his allies are falsely suggesting that mail-in ballots are somewhat fraudulent anyway, that undermines the election results and creates the potential for trump to try to remain in office even if biden is the rightful victor."

"Cities cannot fine homeless people for living outside, U.S. judge rules in Grants Pass case",144,i7wc60,https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/08/cities-cannot-fine-homeless-people-for-living-outside-us-judge-rules-in-grants-pass-case.html,9,1597196775.0,,"grants pass has joined boise in eliciting a precedent-setting court ruling that could alter how cities nationwide cite and fine people living outside.

a federal judge decided on july 22 that the southern oregon city of 37,500 violated its homeless residents’ eighth amendment rights by excluding them from parks without due process and citing them for sleeping outside. the ruling builds on 2018′s landmark martin v. city of boise case that said cities cannot make it illegal to sleep or rest outside without providing people with sufficient indoor alternatives.

grants pass city attorney mark bartholomew said the city plans to appeal the decision.

last year, the u.s. supreme court refused to hear the martin case, forcing cities around the country to rethink how their policies and law enforcement officials deal with growing homeless populations.

in grants pass, homeless people have been showing up for years to the oregon law center office with complaints that their ability to rest was made impossible by local ordinances.

debra blake was one of them. she lost her job and then her housing about 10 years ago and has been homeless in grants pass since. at 7:30 a.m. sept. 11, 2019, blake was lying in her sleeping bag in riverside park when she was cited for illegal camping and prohibited conduct. later that morning, the same officer gave her a ticket for criminal trespass on city property.

blake wasn’t arrested, but the two tickets still came with fines that reached $885. she was also excluded from the parks.

she appealed and two weeks later won, but she received no explanation why.

blake owes grants pass $5,000 in stacked up fines and fees related to being homeless.

she is one of several people who joined the case, many with similar debts.

u.s. magistrate judge mark d. clarke wrote a stinging rebuke of the way grants pass fines people living outside.

“let us not forget that homeless individuals are citizens just as much as those fortunate enough to have a secure living space,” he said.

clarke’s opinion will likely have ramifications far beyond grants pass.

many cities and counties were shaken by the boise example, which has been widely interpreted as saying that it is unconstitutional to arrest people for what are called “sit-lie laws” -- resting and sleeping in public -- if the jurisdiction does not provide adequate shelter or affordable housing.

clarke’s ruling extends that prohibition to the fines and fees that make being homeless difficult.

many places have ordinances similar to grants pass’s with fees for living outside.

clarke pointed out in his opinion that such citations often require a court appearance, which homeless people often either don’t know about because they don’t have an address to receive mail from the court, or do not have the means or will to show up for.

that results in failure to appear warrants that end in arrest the next time the person comes into contact with law enforcement -- an inevitability for many homeless people.

“quality of life laws, even civil citations, contribute to a cycle of incarceration and recidivism,” clarke wrote.

his ruling also left the door open for more court challenges to cities’ treatment of unhoused individuals.

the boise case was based in part on the eighth amendment -- that arresting homeless people for simply being homeless is cruel and unusual punishment.

but clarke went farther in the grants pass case, saying that the city’s policies amount to excessive fines for doing something that all humans must do -- sleeping, staying dry, staying warm, sitting down -- only applied to a small group of humans.

“those activities are just unavoidable and tied up in the status of being unhoused,” said ed johnson, head of the oregon law center.

johnson said that the decision still leaves room for cities and counties to regulate how and where people camp.

“i hope what cities take from it they have a wide range of tools at their disposal, but the tools are not punishing people in their community who have no choice but to be living outside,” johnson said.

the national law center on homelessness and poverty joined the oregon law center in taking grants pass to court. tristia bauman, senior attorney, said she hopes the boise and grants pass cases push cities to rethink how they invest in homelessness now that both criminal and civil punishments can be unconstitutional, if broadly applied.

“the nature of the punishment is somewhat inconsequential,” bauman said. “at the time of enforcement, the message is the same: you are engaged in some kind of law violation because you are living in public because you have no option but to do so.”

grants pass created its system of fines as part of a strategy to make it difficult to be homeless there. according to court documents, top city officials hoped that the stringent rules would encourage people to leave the city, even if they grew up there.

about 70% to 80% of homeless people in grants pass are from the area, according to court documents.

however, clarke said that a jurisdiction doesn’t have to intentionally dissuade homeless people from staying there to violate the eighth amendment.

“arresting the homeless is almost never an adequate solution because, apart from the constitutional impediments, it is expensive, not rehabilitating, often a waste of limited public resources , and does nothing to serve those homeless individuals who suffer from mental illness and substance abuse addiction,” clarke said.

updated at 7 p.m. et

former vice president joe biden, the presumptive democratic presidential nominee, has picked sen. kamala harris of california as his running mate.

the selection will make harris the third woman and first black and first asian american candidate to be nominated for vice president by a major political party.

""these aren't normal times,"" biden said in an email to supporters tuesday afternoon, referencing the coronavirus pandemic and calls for racial justice. ""i need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. kamala is that person.""

harris tweeted that she's ""honored"" to join the ticket, saying biden can ""unify the american people because he's spent his life fighting for us. and as president, he'll build an america that lives up to our ideals.""

in his note, biden also referred to harris' friendship with his late son, beau. harris and beau biden were state attorneys general at the same time.

""[beau] had enormous respect for her and her work,"" joe biden wrote tuesday. ""i thought a lot about that as i made this decision. there is no one's opinion i valued more than beau's and i'm proud to have kamala standing with me on this campaign.""

the two are set to deliver remarks in biden's hometown of wilmington, del., on wednesday, and together hold a virtual fundraiser.

the pandemic prevents biden and harris from rolling out their ticket in the usual format: a boisterous introductory rally in a key swing state.

the harris pick creates a democratic ticket that in many ways mirrors the one biden ran on in 2008 with then-sen. barack obama: an older white man and washington lifer with deep foreign policy experience is paired with a younger, black running mate with immigrant roots who has been in the senate just four years yet still has managed to carve out a national profile. only this time, biden is occupying the top spot.

biden's age, and the fact that the 77-year-old has repeatedly referred to himself as a ""transitional"" candidate, will almost certainly place increased focus on the 55-year-old harris as the likely future leader of the democratic party.

""that little girl was me""

the ticket is being formed despite a moment of tension between biden and harris during the democratic primary. while biden regularly criticized obama's lack of experience when he was also running in the 2008 democratic primary, biden never attacked obama in the high-profile, personal way that harris did during a televised debate in 2019.

harris, whose own campaign saw black voters in south carolina as key to her chances of winning the primary, criticized biden for previously opposing federal busing mandates. ""there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools,"" harris said on the miami stage. ""and she was bused to school every day. and that little girl was me."" the attack briefly cost biden support and surged harris toward the top of the polls, but those numbers quickly reversed themselves, especially after harris conceded that she and biden held similar views on whether busing decisions should be made on the local or federal level.

harris ultimately endorsed biden and campaigned for him after suspending her presidential campaign in late 2019.

ahead of the running mate selection, several biden allies and donors warned in the press that the debate attack was too personal, and too harsh, for harris to serve as biden's vice president.

the critiques raised cries of sexism — particularly a politico report saying former sen. chris dodd of connecticut, a member of biden's vice presidential selection committee, was surprised that harris had no ""remorse"" for the attack.

many democrats pointed out that biden, george h.w. bush, john edwards and other men who became running mates of people they had opposed in a presidential primary rarely faced questions about whether they had any ""remorse"" for campaign critiques, or whether they were too ""ambitious"" for the no. 2 job.

as the harris criticisms ticked up in the weeks before the pick, biden's campaign tried to diffuse them. ""ambitious women make history, change the world, and win. our campaign is full of ambitious women going all out for joe biden,"" biden's campaign manager, jen o'malley dillon, tweeted in late july.

ahead of harris' selection, a group called we have her back — which includes former obama senior adviser valerie jarrett and leaders from planned parenthood and the national women's law center — sent a letter to various media outlets demanding fair coverage of the vice presidential candidate.

""women have been subject to stereotypes and tropes about qualifications, leadership, looks, relationships and experience. those stereotypes are often amplified and weaponized for black and brown women,"" the letter said, urging the media to resist popular coverage tropes such as ""likeability"" and ""electability"" for candidates who happen to be women — analysis they said is hardly ever applied to male candidates.

obama, trump respond to the selection

obama offered his congratulations to harris, saying in a statement tuesday that biden ""nailed this decision.""

""she is more than prepared for the job,"" obama said of harris. ""she's spent her career defending our constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. her own life story is one that i and so many others can see ourselves in: a story that says that no matter where you come from, what you look like, how you worship, or who you love, there's a place for you here. it's a fundamentally american perspective, one that's led us out of the hardest times before. and it's a perspective we can all rally behind right now.""

meanwhile, president trump, in a press briefing tuesday, said he was ""a little surprised"" by the pick, given harris' attack on biden in the democratic debate.

trump also slammed what he called harris' ""horrible"" questioning of his supreme court nominee, brett kavanaugh, and her legislative record, saying she is ""known as being about the most liberal person in the senate.""

a longtime prosecutor

harris was born in oakland, calif., and grew up in berkeley. she's the daughter of jamaican and indian immigrants, and attended howard university in washington, d.c., and the university of california hastings college of the law in san francisco.

she was a prosecutor in the alameda county and san francisco district attorney's offices before running for san francisco district attorney in 2003. she went on to win election as california attorney general in 2010.

in 2016, harris became just the second black woman in u.s. history to be elected to the u.s. senate. she was assigned to the intelligence committee, which held several nationally televised hearings on russia's efforts to interfere in the presidential election, and how trump's campaign and the department of justice responded to those efforts.

the longtime prosecutor also sat on the judiciary committee, which oversaw the confirmation of two u.s. supreme court justices: neil gorsuch and kavanaugh.

the high-profile hearings that each committee held quickly helped harris develop a national reputation as a sharp, aggressive questioner who could unnerve opposing witnesses. she generated headlines and energized progressives across the country with her questioning of attorney general jeff sessions, attorney general william barr and, most notably, kavanaugh.

in january 2019, harris launched a bid for the white house. she was initially seen as a serious contender for the democratic nomination, drawing more than 20,000 people to her kickoff rally in oakland. but harris struggled to articulate a clear reason for her candidacy in a crowded field, and her campaign experienced bouts of infighting.

since returning full time to the senate, harris has played a lead role in senate democrats' response to both the coronavirus crisis, and the increased focus on systemic racism and police brutality.

biden's pick came amid intense pressure from democrats not only to pick a woman, which he promised to do in march, but also to pick a woman of color. that drumbeat began well before george floyd's killing at the hands of minneapolis police but intensified amid sustained protests across the country.

harris will be the fourth woman on a major party's national ticket. all three women to run for president and vice president have lost: democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton in 2016, republican vice presidential nominee sarah palin in 2008 and democratic vice presidential nominee geraldine ferraro in 1984.

the only previous black candidate on a presidential ticket, obama, won the white house with biden at his side in 2008."
Democratic presidential candidate Biden taps Senator Kamala Harris as running mate,0,i7zica,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-harris-idUSKCN2572MZ,2,1597206773.0,[deleted],"(reuters) - democratic presidential candidate joe biden on tuesday picked senator kamala harris as his choice for vice president, making her the first black woman on a major-party u.s. presidential ticket and giving him a partner well prepared to go on the attack against republican president donald trump.

with social unrest over racial injustice rocking the country for months, biden had been under increasing pressure to select a black woman as his running mate. harris is also the first asian-american on a major presidential ticket.

in harris, a 55-year-old senator from california who made her own run for the white house, biden gains an experienced politician already battle-tested by the rigors of the 2020 presidential campaign as they head into the final stretch of the nov. 3 election.

biden on twitter called harris “a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants.” harris wrote on twitter that biden could “unify the american people because he’s spent his life fighting for us.”

biden and harris will appear together on wednesday at an event in his hometown of wilmington, delaware, the campaign said.

harris, who became only the second black female u.s. senator in history when elected in 2016, will be relied on to help mobilize african americans, the democratic party’s most loyal constituency. four years ago, the first dip in black voter turnout in 20 years contributed to democrat hillary clinton’s upset loss to trump.

biden, whose foundering campaign was rescued by black voters in south carolina’s primary in february, needs their strong support against trump. they will be crucial in battleground states such as michigan, pennsylvania and wisconsin, where trump narrowly prevailed in 2016, as well as republican-leaning southern states like georgia and florida that polls show have become competitive this year.

biden served as vice president for eight years under president barack obama, the first black u.s. president.

numerous black leaders, including politicians who had themselves been considered as biden’s running mate, emphasized the historic import of harris’ selection.

“to see a black woman nominated for the first time reaffirms my faith that in america, there is a place for every person to succeed no matter who they are or where they come from,” said u.s. representative val demings, a black woman who had been a contender.

obama, perhaps the party’s most popular figure, praised harris on twitter: “she’s spent her career defending our constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake.”

the biden campaign notched its best grassroots fundraising day following the announcement, according to one of its digital directors, clarke humphrey.

republicans immediately tried to portray harris as a “radical” who embraces far-left priorities such as sweeping police reform and a ban on fracking.

during a white house briefing on tuesday, trump called harris “the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful” and “most liberal” senator and said she was his “no. 1 draft pick” given her unsuccessful presidential campaign.

on a conference call the trump campaign hosted for reporters, republican senator marsha blackburn asserted that harris supports eliminating private insurance in favor of medicare for all and said her selection reflects the “leftist takeover” of the party.

as a presidential candidate, harris proposed a government-run system that would still allow private insurers to offer plans; she also supported a fracking ban. biden has not embraced either proposal.

harris, a former prosecutor and state attorney general in california, is known for her sometimes aggressive questioning style in the senate, most notably of brett kavanaugh during his 2018 supreme court confirmation hearing.

as a presidential candidate, she also took biden to task in a nationally televised debate over his past stances on mandatory busing for students as a means to desegregate schools. some biden advisers have told reuters the attacks made them question whether she would be a trusted working partner because of her political ambitions.

while that exchange failed to boost her white house hopes, the biden campaign will now look for her to train her fire on trump and vice president mike pence. harris is scheduled to debate pence on oct. 7 in salt lake city, utah.

the choice of a running mate has added significance for biden, 77, who would be the oldest person to become president if he is elected. his age has led to speculation he will serve only one term, making harris a potential top contender for the nomination in 2024.

biden publicly committed to choosing a woman as his no. 2 in a march debate after discussing the matter with his wife jill.

after the protests that erupted over the may 25 killing of george floyd, a black man, by a white policeman in minneapolis, biden’s search focused predominantly on candidates of color.

harris will be confirmed as biden’s running mate at the democratic convention that begins on monday, where biden will also be formally nominated to challenge trump.

a prominent voice

harris has become a key ally for biden at a time when race has been thrust to the forefront of the campaign.

after floyd’s death, she became a leading voice in the push for racial justice and police reform.

harris came under criticism from some in the black community and from progressive advocates for her record as california attorney general where, they say, she did not do enough to investigate police shootings and too often sided with prosecutors in wrongful conviction cases.

her defenders say she has always been reform-minded – and point to her record in the senate, where she has championed a police-reform bill and an anti-lynching bill, among other measures.

harris, whose mother and father emigrated from india and jamaica, respectively, was the first woman to serve as san francisco’s district attorney and the first woman to serve as california’s attorney general.

historically, the vice presidential nominee has taken the lead in criticizing the opposing ticket, although trump has largely shredded that tradition. brian brokaw, a california political consultant who managed harris’ campaigns for attorney general and senate, said she fits that role well.

“she is someone who can really make republicans quake in their boots,” brokaw said."
US attorney experiencing 'tidal wave' of cases after ruling,69,i80kio,https://apnews.com/29956a373e7f92f749334e6fdac16469,5,1597210206.0,,"file - in this june 20, 2018, file photo, u.s. attorney trent shores speaks at a news conference tulsa, okla. federal prosecutors from as far away as new york and florida are helping the u.s. attorney in tulsa deal with what he describes as a ""tidal wave"" of new cases. u.s. attorney shores said tuesday the increase in cases is a result of a recent u.s. supreme court decision. that decision determined that a large swath of eastern oklahoma remains a muscogee (creek) nation indian reservation.(matt barnard/tulsa world via ap file)

tulsa, okla. (ap) — federal prosecutors from as far away as new york and florida are helping the u.s. attorney in tulsa, oklahoma, deal with what he described tuesday as a “tidal wave” of new cases resulting from a recent u.s. supreme court decision.

u.s. attorney for the northern district of oklahoma trent shores said the number of criminal indictments more than doubled in the last month as a result of the ruling in mcgirt v. oklahoma , which determined that a large swath of eastern oklahoma remains a muscogee (creek) nation indian reservation. as a result, either the federal government or the tribal nation has jurisdiction over crimes committed by or against native americans, not the state.

“our prosecution responsibilities have increased substantially,” shores said during a roundtable discussion in tulsa with tulsa county district attorney steve kunzweiler, muscogee (creek) nation assistant attorney general kyle haskins and tulsa police department deputy chief eric dalgleish.

“it’s a lot of work. we’re standing up and taking it on our shoulders right now. we’re also looking forward to reinforcements.”

the creek nation’s territory, alone, encompassed more than 3 million acres, including most of what became the state’s second-largest city, tulsa.

shores said the u.s. attorney’s office in muskogee is seeing a similar increase in the number of cases it is prosecuting.

shores said about 20 federal prosecutors and support staff from u.s. attorney offices in florida, new york and pennsylvania have agreed to help the office with an overflow of cases.

kunzweiler said he is working to get some of his assistant district attorneys cross-appointed to work with prosecutors in shores’ office on various cases.

while protocols and procedures may have changed for tulsa police, dalgleish said nothing has changed for citizens who call 911.

“we’re sending an officer there to handle that call, and they will make those decisions (on jurisdiction) when they show up,” dalgleish said, adding that his officers are cross-deputized with the muscogee (creek) nation and are able to handle cases involving native american suspects or victims.

meanwhile, kunzweiler said his office is also experiencing a significant increase in the number of criminal defendants who are seeking post-conviction relief as a result of the court’s ruling.

oklahoma attorney general mike hunter estimated last week that as many as 2,000 inmates could seek to have their convictions overturned as a result of the ruling, including several who are on death row."
Investors revalue Chinese tech giants after U.S. ban,119,i8drdk,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-markets-tech/investors-revalue-chinese-tech-giants-after-us-ban-idUSKCN2581AM,6,1597267805.0,,"shanghai/hong kong (reuters) - stock investor zhu haifeng halved his once-cherished holdings in chinese tech giants tencent and alibaba after the united states announced on friday sanctions against some chinese firms in the latest escalation between the world’s two top economies.

file photo: a logo of a chinese tech firm tencent, owner of a messaging app wechat, is pictured in beijing, china august 7, 2020. reuters/thomas peter/file photo

the move followed u.s. president donald trump's announcement of a sweeping ban on u.s. transactions with tencent holdings 0700.hk, the chinese owner of messaging app wechat, and bytedance, which owns the video-sharing app tiktok, citing national security threats.

tencent now only represents 10% of his portfolio, having accounted for 40% at the peak of his purchases in the company which began some five years ago. e-commerce giant alibaba group holding baba.n now represents 5% of his holdings.

“i was envisioning a global tencent, a global alibaba. now, i can only think of southeast asian versions,” said zhu, who has several million yuan in overseas-listed chinese companies.

“the room for imagination evaporates. valuation should be cut by one third.”

like other investors, he worries that washington’s move to restrict mainland technology companies could curb their growth potential.

that concern drove shares of tencent and alibaba down some 5% each on friday, but they were still up roughly 39% and 17% respectively so far this year after friday’s losses.

under trump’s executive order, any transaction related to wechat and tiktok would be banned in the united states.

the trump administration last week also announced the expansion of the “clean network” initiative which aims to prevent various chinese apps and telecom firms from accessing sensitive information on american citizens and businesses, targeting firms like tencent, alibaba and huawei [hwt.ul].

the latest blow comes as the relationship between the two powerhouses has nosedived since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

“fundamentally, it’s not a big shock to the earnings. but right now, i think the market is still trying to digest this information because of the political backdrop,” said paul sandhu, asia pacific head of multi-assets quant solutions at bnp paribas asset management.

“there’s a lot of ambiguity concerning the so called ‘clean network’,” he said, forecasting more market volatility ahead.

downside risks

brokerage clsa said the fall in tencent and alibaba shares represented a buying opportunity, expecting the u.s. ban to only have a small impact because the u.s. only contributes less than 3% to each firm’s overall revenue.

but morgan stanley said there was “significantly amplified” downside risk to chinese internet gaming companies if the u.s. ban expands to cover more businesses, or prohibits investment in the united states by chinese tech firms.

“globalisation is one of the key growth drivers for china internet stocks as user growth decelerates and competition intensifies in china,” morgan stanley wrote.

tencent, which derives more than a third of its revenues from gaming, has invested in a number of overseas video game studios such as riot games and supercell, and has also partnered with many western gaming firms in china and asia.

a fund manager based in shanghai, who owns tencent shares, also said the sanctions cast a shadow over share trading.

“if we see the u.s. take actions against china from time to time, i think share price volatility in chinese tech companies will continue,” he said on condition of anonymity.

he expected the future growth of tencent to be mainly driven by domestic e-ecommerce, fintech and short-video businesses."
6 former EPA bosses call for agency reset after election,299,i8dxuw,https://apnews.com/7b5ec8e0002f3dce6bf88edde92dcb6c,16,1597268486.0,,"file - in this sept. 21, 2017, file photo, the environmental protection agency (epa) building is shown in washington. six former environmental protection agency chiefs are calling for an agency reset after president donald trump’s regulation-chopping, industry-minded first term. the group is presenting a detailed action plan drafted by former epa staffers for whoever wins the nov. 3 presidential election.

(ap photo/pablo martinez monsivais)

six former environmental protection agency chiefs called wednesday for a “reset” at the agency after president donald trump’s regulation-chopping, industry-minded first term, backing a detailed plan by former epa staffers that ranges from renouncing political influence in regulation to boosting climate-friendly electric vehicles .

the current administrator, andrew wheeler, immediately rejected the recommendations, and his spokesman james hewitt accused wheeler’s predecessors of having “botched” environmental matters during their tenures.

most living former epa heads signed on; one notable exception was trump’s first epa chief, scott pruitt. the group — william reilly, lee thomas, carol browner, christine todd whitman, lisa jackson and gina mccarthy — served under republican and democratic presidents.

the environmental protection network, a bipartisan group of more than 500 former epa senior managers and employees, crafted the hundreds of pages of recommendations for a change of course at the agency.

the group said the road map was meant to guide whatever administration the nov. 3 presidential election puts in place, although many of the proposals are implicitly or explicitly critical of the trump epa’s actions. the former epa heads’ accompanying statement did not mention trump but said they were “concerned about the current state of affairs at epa.”

hewitt, the epa spokesman, said wheeler “is proud of our record addressing environmental problems impacting americans.” he cited the epa’s work on superfund sites, lead contamination and air.

wheeler “won’t be taking ‘reset’ advice from administrators who ignored the flint lead crisis, botched the gold king mine response, and encouraged new yorkers to breath contaminated air at ground zero,” hewitt said in an email, referencing the drinking water contamination in flint, michigan, and a waste water spill in colorado.

whitman, epa chief under president george w. bush, said wheeler’s reaction “shows that epa has a long way to go to get back on track.”

“it should start by welcoming input from experts instead of being dismissive and insulting,” she said.

some of the reset recommendations were aimed at the trump era , such as minimizing industry and political influence on science-based decisions in regulatory actions, combating climate change and cutting air pollution with electric vehicles, and others. the proposals are in line with critics’ complaints about trump and with many of democratic presidential rival joe biden’s proposals .

the epa under wheeler, a former coal lobbyist , has been an avid agent of trump’s drive to cut regulations he sees as unnecessarily burdensome to business, including the coal, gas and oil industries. the administration says it is rolling back rules without increasing risk to the public health and environment.

nationally, many public health officials, environmental groups, democratic lawmakers, scientists and others disagree, saying trump’s regulation-cutting, combined with sharp drops in many areas of enforcement against polluters , is increasing air and water pollutants and industrial toxins and jeopardizing the health of americans.

when it comes to the epa’s mandate of protecting peoples’ health and the environment, “the last few years, the agency has been derailed from that mission,” browner, who led the agency in the clinton administration, said in a statement.

saying environmental and health protections were essential to economic growth, browner called the reset recommendations “reaffirmations of our environmental laws, and return to where the clean air act and clean water act are respected and enforced and where policy is science-based and aimed at protecting our health and environment.”

the ex-epa staffers’ recommendations range from broad mandates — like increasing the agency’s actions across the board on the disproportionate exposure that black, hispanic and other minority communities and low-income areas have to all kinds of dangerous pollutants — to the specific, like which measures from trump’s first term to focus on in the first 100 days of a new term. they also urge increased funding.

specific public health and environmental rollbacks from trump’s first term targeted for proposed annihilation or rewriting by the ex-epa employees include a pending trump regulation-easing measure for climate-damaging methane from oil and gas production that the epa is expected to announce in the coming days.

some of the many other trump epa measures on the “out” list in the reset proposal: a “transparency” rule supported by industry that limits what public health studies the agency can use in making regulations; a trump-driven move to ease vehicle mileage and emission standards ; and a heavily voluntary plan for cutting fossil fuel emissions by power plants that replaced the obama administration’s broad plan for making the nation’s power sector more climate friendly.

another recommendation: cultivate “a more open and respectful exchange between reporters and epa.”

wednesday’s recommendations at times make the job of changing course at the epa seem formidable. the agency’s air office, for instance, they say, “has a massive to-do list, a huge amount of pressure from outside groups, a demoralized and diminished career staff to tend to, and an incredible sense of urgency.”

michelle roos, executive director of the ex-employees group, said more than 100 former epa staffers prepared the action plan over 10 months. roos said the changes would “better protect the air we breathe and the water we drink” and do more to confront climate change and the heightened pollutant risks of minority and low-income communities."

One of the first successful Russian-backed misinformation efforts of the 2020 election tricked Donald Trump Jr. and Ted Cruz into helping spread false claims about Portland protesters,2,i8oo52,https://www.businessinsider.com/top-conservatives-helped-amplify-russian-misinformation-report-2020-8,4,1597303260.0,,"earlier this month, prominent conservatives including donald trump jr. and sen. ted cruz retweeted misleading claims and footage attempting to depict portland protesters as having burned a ""stack of bibles.""

but that narrative had been set in motion by a russian-backed media outlet called ruptly, the new york times reported tuesday.

after ruptly aired the misleadingly edited footage of the protesters, a right-wing commentator tweeted the footage and claims further mischaracterizing it. then several conservative politicians and news outlets amplified that tweet.

the incident reveals russia's evolving and increasingly nuanced misinformation tactics, which rely on real people spreading stories with elements of truth, not just fake news.

visit business insider's homepage for more stories.

several high-profile conservatives including donald trump jr. and sen. ted cruz of texas shared russian misinformation earlier this month, the new york times reported tuesday.

in portland, oregon, protests against police brutality have continued for more than 70 consecutive days. the protests have been largely peaceful, but protesters have also on some occasions lit bonfires.

in one of those instances, at a protest on august 1, a few protesters used a bible and an american flag to start a fire, which others eventually put out, according to the times.

local media outlets reported that the protests had been peaceful throughout the day and that the fire was started only at the end of the night as a dwindling crowd of a few dozen to 100 people spoke about the black lives matter movement. only one report mentioned a bible being involved at all.

but ruptly, the video arm of the russian state-backed media outlet russia today that has livestreamed the protests and published highlight clips nightly, focused its summary video that night on the burning of what appeared to be a single bible, the times reported. it tweeted the video twice, both times noting the bible being set on fire.

a twitter user with just a few followers also tweeted the video shortly before deleting their account — but not before ian miles cheong, a right-wing agitator, retweeted them, adding his own false claim that the protesters burned ""a stack of bibles.""

—ian miles cheong (@stillgray) august 1, 2020

cheong's tweet was shared widely, sparking coverage from prominent and conservative media outlets and blogs including the new york post, the federalist, gateway pundit, and the blaze, as well as retweets from trump jr. and cruz.

in a statement to the new york times, ruptly disputed the newspaper's characterization of the live-streamed video.

but the success of ruptly's coverage of the portland protest reveals how russia's misinformation tactics have evolved since the 2016 presidential election, where american intelligence agencies have repeatedly concluded that russia interfered with the aim of hurting hillary clinton's candidacy.

in 2016, russia relied heavily on fake facebook, instagram, twitter, youtube, and other social-media accounts to artificially amplify fake news stories created by the internet research agency, its in-house troll farm.

but russia is deploying new, more sophisticated tactics this time around, and the portland protest story shows how it has learned to leverage hot-button issues likely to resonate with highly partisan or ideological groups to sow dissent.

cybersecurity experts have found russia exploiting the coronavirus pandemic and racial tensions in the us, and us intelligence agencies have warned that russia is attempting to sway the election toward president donald trump again in 2020. trump has repeatedly downplayed the assessments of us intelligence agencies, giving deference to fringe agitators who support him."

a georgia republican who has said that muslims do not belong in government and expressed her belief in the baseless conspiracy theory called qanon has won her primary runoff and is all but certain to win a seat in the house of representatives in november.

marjorie taylor greene, a construction executive, won 57% of the vote in georgia's heavily-republican 14th congressional district, handily defeating neurosurgeon john cowan, who had pitched himself as, ""all of the conservative, none of the embarrassment.""

president trump congratulated greene on wednesday morning, calling her a ""future republican star"" who is ""strong on everything.""

many high-ranking republicans in the house of representatives distanced themselves from greene earlier this summer, after politico highlighted videos in which greene expressed anti-muslim sentiments. a spokesman for house minority leader kevin mccarthy called her views ""appalling.""

facebook took down an ad in which greene brandished a rifle and threatened antifa protesters, saying it violated its policies against inciting violence. and many media outlets have covered her support for the outlandish qanon conspiracy theory.

as emma hurt of member station wabe reports, ""all of it only fueled her message.""

""the fake news media hates me. big tech censors me,"" greene said in a video on twitter. ""the dc swamp fears me. and george soros and the democrats are trying to take me down.""

in videos spotlighted by politico, greene called the election of two muslim women to congress ""an islamic invasion into our government.""

in one video message, greene acknowledged that u.s. laws protect freedom of religion — and then said, ""but i'm sorry, anyone that is a muslim, that believes in sharia law, does not belong in our government.""

""let me explain something to you, muhammad,"" she said in one video. ""we already have equality and justice for all americans. muslims are not being held back in any way ... what you people want is special treatment. you want to rise above us.""

greene also said that generations of black and hispanic men have been held down by ""being in gangs and dealing drugs,"" not by anything white people have done; that both white supremacists and members of the black lives matter movement are ""idiots""; and that in seeking the black vote, democrats are ""trying to keep the black people in a modern-day form of slavery.""

democrats are the real racists, greene said, stating that ""the most mistreated group of people in the united states today are white males.""

greene made national headlines in early june, after she won the first round of primary voting for her district and multiple news outlets covered her support for the qanon conspiracy.

the once-fringe conspiracy has made inroads into the mainstream, with multiple gop candidates expressing, at a minimum, openness to the qanon narrative.

the conspiracy includes a wide variety of shifting and often-contradictory predictions and allegations, but it centers on an anonymous figure named ""q"" who asserts that a wave of mass arrests are about to take down high-ranking trump opponents.

followers of ""q"" often believe that the world is controlled by elite members of a secretive satanic child sex-trafficking ring.

""q is a patriot, we know that for sure,"" greene said in a video from 2017, in which she recapped some of q's predictions and why she supports them.

""there's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and i think we have the president to do it,"" she said, referring to trump."
Trump‌ ‌says‌ ‌he opposes‌ ‌USPS‌ ‌funding‌ ‌in‌ ‌an‌ ‌effort‌ ‌to‌ ‌block ‌mail-in‌ ‌voting‌,572,i9210g,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/13/trump-opposes-usps-funding-394692,118,1597361592.0,,"politico dispatch: august 14 so how did a centuries-old american institution end up at the center of the most heated political fight in washington? it’s a little complicated, but we break down the mail-in ballot battle.

election security experts say cases of electoral fraud are exceedingly rare in the united states. most acknowledge that mail-in voting has a slightly higher risk of fraud, but it isn’t widespread.

“saying that voter fraud and election crimes are rare is not to say they’re nonexistent,” rick hasen, an election law expert at the university of california irvine, said in an interview in early july. “when election crimes do occur, absentee balloting is a more common way it occurs” than through in-person voting, he said, but “it seems to be a very rare problem.”

“it is really hard to try to swing a local election by tampering with absentee ballots. because such a scheme easily comes to the attention of voters whose ballots are missing or recorded as voting and it potentially involves a scheme among many people,” hasen said. “it is that much harder to do so with a larger election.”

trump’s funding numbers are a reference to the heroes act, house democrats’ opening offer for the next round of coronavirus relief that passed out of the chamber on a largely party-line vote in mid-may. the bill was dead on arrival in the republican-controlled senate, and talks on the next round of coronavirus relief have stalled.

the house bill contained myriad funding streams, including $3.6 billion in “election resilience grants,” which election administrators across the country could use “for contingency planning, preparation, and resilience of elections.” the money could be used on everything from preparing for the influx of mail-in ballots, to protecting in-person voting and buying personal protective equipment for poll workers.

the heroes act also included a $25 billion payment to the usps “for revenue forgone due to coronavirus.”

the bill also contained provisions that would amount to a sweeping overhaul of the american electoral system, including mandating that voters be sent ballots during times of emergency or disaster (including this november), requiring in-person early voting and effectively eliminating voter id laws by allowing voters to submit sworn statements in lieu of an id in most cases.

as of late, trump has sought to draw a distinction between absentee voting and mail-in voting. election experts often use the term interchangeably, but there is a difference between universal mail-in voting — where voters are automatically mailed a ballot, whether they requested one or not — and most states’ systems.

""whether you call it vote by mail or absentee voting, in florida the election system is safe and secure,"" trump tweeted earlier this month, encouraging supporters to vote-by-mail in the state.

during a white house press briefing on thursday, trump dismissed reports that he's attempting to suppress the vote in november, but said americans would have to vote in person if a bill with funding for the usps and universal mail-in voting isn't passed by congress.

""i want them to vote,"" trump said. ""but that would mean that they'd have to go to a voting booth like they used to and vote.""

when pressed on how the government would ensure voters' safety if they head to the polls in person, the president didn't provide specific actions that would be taken.

""they’re gonna have to feel safe — and they will be safe. and we will make sure that they’re safe,"" trump said. ""again, absentee good, universal mail-in very bad.""

despite the president’s fixation on it, universal vote-by-mail systems are not widely used across the country.

five states do it as a regular course: colorado, hawaii, oregon, utah and washington. three states — california, nevada and vermont — along with the district of columbia, plan on mailing voters ballots in response to the pandemic.

montana has also left that decision up to individual counties for november. every county in the state opted to mail ballots to voters for montana's june primary.

most states do allow for no-excuse absentee voting, meaning any voter can request an absentee ballot, regardless of health status, age or other factors.

just eight states — indiana, kentucky, louisiana, mississippi, new york, south carolina, tennessee and texas — require voters to have a valid excuse to request an absentee ballot for november. the new york times estimates that 76 percent of voters live in states where, at a minimum, there is no-excuse absentee voting.

the president’s comments also come as democrats and election security experts sound the alarm over changes at the usps. trump recently installed louis dejoy, a deep-pocketed supporter of the president, as postmaster general. dejoy has overseen a shakeup of the the postal service’s top echelon of staffers.

""the president of the united states is sabotaging a basic service that hundreds of millions of people rely upon, cutting a critical lifeline for rural economies and for delivery of medicines, because he wants to deprive americans of their fundamental right to vote safely during the most catastrophic public health crisis in over 100 years,"" andrew bates, a spokesperson for joe biden's campaign, said in a statement reacting to trump's comments.

the usps’ general counsel also recently sent a letter to some state election officials that caused concern among voting rights groups and some election administrators. the letter, first reported by the spokesman-review in washington state, recommended that election officials use first-class mail to send election materials, warning that the bulk rate that some election administrators use may result in untimely delivery of election materials.

such a shift in how mail-in ballots are sent would amount to a major change for many local election officials. derek brenchley, deputy director of elections in the utah’s lieutenant governor’s office, recently told politico in an email that his office had received a similar letter and that most local officials in the state have used the lower bulk rate in the past. switching all mailings from the bulk rate to first-class rate would amount to more than doubling of election offices' postal budgets.

washington secretary of state kim wyman, a republican widely considered an expert on mail-in voting, told politico that she met with usps officials earlier in the week to discuss the letter, and that some of her initial concerns were alleviated.

“they assured us that they were still going to treat election mail with the highest priority. and they were going to try to make good on that commitment and that history,” she said in an interview on tuesday. “we're comfortable that we're going to be able to do the nonprofit bulk for the first mailing” of ballots.

but later ballots may still require more expensive postage, which could present a challenge for cash-strapped election administrators across the country. wyman also stressed washington’s long relationship with the usps, a benefit other states may not have.

dejoy is scheduled to appear before the house oversight committee in mid-september to address lawmakers’ questions. rep. gerald connolly (d-va.), who chairs the house oversight government operations subcommittee, said he had hoped to secure dejoy's testimony sooner, since several states will have begun early voting by the time the postmaster general appears, but he said dejoy cited scheduling conflicts until then.

in the meantime, connolly said he's working to advance legislation that would undo a series of policy changes dejoy implemented until the coronavirus emergency is lifted, as well as a bill that would require the postal service to prioritize mail-in ballots.

he said trump is engaged in a ""psychological game"" to convince americans that mail-in voting isn't safe even though it is. ""he's trying to get in people's heads that the mail is unreliable, that 'they don't have the money and i'm going to make sure they don't get it, and therefore you're going to take your chances with a mail-in ballot,’"" connolly said in an interview.

connolly said he's weighing additional hearings in advance of dejoy's and has considered calling dejoy's predecessor, megan brennan, who delayed her planned retirement to steer the postal service through the early days of the pandemic, as well as her former deputy.

democrats in both chambers of congress sent letters to dejoy on wednesday demanding answers on the changes he is making at the post office, including on postal rates for election mailings.

“if any changes are made to long-standing practices of moving election mail just months ahead of the 2020 general election, it will cause further delays to election mail that will disenfranchise voters and put significant financial pressure on election jurisdictions,” a letter from senate democrats read. house democrats sent a letter raising similar concerns.

‘It Was a Planned Attack.’ Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Says Looting Was Organized,5,i929nd,https://time.com/5878688/chicago-mayor-lori-lightfoot-looting/,4,1597362340.0,[deleted],"a day after looters smashed-in retailer’s windows, carried away loads of high-end merchandise and overwhelmed police officers in downtown chicago, mayor lori lightfoot says the violence was an organized raid and not a demonstration of angry protest.

“when people showed up on michigan avenue in the downtown area with u-haul trucks and cargo vans, and sophisticated equipment used to cut metal, and the methods that were used, and how quickly it got spun up… that wasn’t any spontaneous reaction,” lightfoot told time in her fifth-floor offices at chicago’s city hall on tuesday.

the chaos that unfolded sunday night, and into the predawn hours monday, was initially blamed on a police shooting in the city’s southside englewood neighborhood. news of the incident—along with misinformation that a minor had been shot—pinballed on social media, resulting in “caravans” of cars headed north downtown, lightfoot says.

“to be sure, there are people that did join in that were motivated by lots of different reasons, and certainly were motivated by social media posts encouraging people to come downtown,” lightfoot says. “but the core of what happened — that’s organized criminal activity… it was a planned attack.”

for three hours that night, chicago was under virtual siege. hundreds of people flooded the streets. looters broke into buildings and came out with armfuls of jewelry, clothes, electronics and other goods. the 911 switchboard was swamped with 1,800 calls between midnight and 3 a.m., a figure that’s typically in the teens at those hours. lightfoot says the looters knew that police staffing would be low that early monday morning and therefore picked “the moments where they feel like they have the best opportunity to make a move.”

the aftermath seen at the store nordstrom on aug. 10, 2020, following a night of unrest in chicago. rmv/shutterstock

the city’s magnificent mile and other shopping districts were hit with widespread theft, vandalism and destruction. many of the businesses were big-name retailers like gucci, nordstrom and apple. some were looted just six weeks earlier amid the violent unrest that erupted after george floyd, an unarmed black man, died in minneapolis police custody in may. and all were struggling to deal with the economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic.

chicago, like many other u.s. cities, is in the midst of a surge in violent crime. last month, 573 people were shot in america’s third largest city — at least 58 of them juveniles. there have been 430 recorded homicides through july, which represents a 51% increase over the same period last year. compare that to new york city, for example, which had just 237 murders, despite having nearly three times the population.

in recent days, the chicago police department has instituted 12-hour shifts and canceled days off for all officers until further notice. on monday, the department sent 400 officers downtown. expressway exits were closed and nearly every bridge was raised to seal off the area. by dawn, it was clear chicago was an american city in distress. shattered glass carpeted sidewalks. trash billowed down major streets. police stood guard in riot gear on corners.

lightfoot says authorities have yet to identify ringleaders or individuals who she believes strategized the violence. a task force of police detectives, fbi agents and officials with the u.s. attorney’s office are now busy collecting and analyzing hundreds of hours of security camera footage to identify those involved.

“we’re still going through lots and lots of video tape,” lightfoot says. “but people were able to fairly quickly take out cash registers, atm machines, cut through metal grate, and to get beyond and behind security systems that are pretty sophisticated. that’s not your average looter.”

the mayor says she’s instructed police to locate every automobile spotted downtown amid the looting for “being part of a criminal operation.” “every car that we can trace to a resident of the chicago, i want that car found and i want it towed,” she says. “we’re not messing around.”

on state street, in chicago’s river north downtown neighborhood, bill lamacchia, 54, estimated about $20,000 damage on his bar and restaurant, bijan’s chicago. shards of glass that used to be part of his revolving door and window panels crunched under his gym shoes as he walked. a group of looters had heaved a marble-top table through a massive picture window overlooking the outside patio. they took nearly every bottle of liquor from his shelves. some of them even sat and drank the bottles in his patio seats. the whole scene was captured on his security camera. “it was like a video game,” lamacchia said. “they did whatever they wanted.”

ariel atkins, a black lives matter chicago organizer, dismissed authorities’ narrative during a rally monday in support of the more than 100 individuals arrested for various offenses during the looting. her organization believes sunday night’s unrest was an organic reaction to the shooting in englewood, which she pointed out was yet another example of the distrust between police and many black americans.

“the mayor cannot expect people to play by her rules as she refuses to treat them with basic dignity,” a black lives matter chicago statement said. “these protests can only end when the safety and well-being of our communities is finally prioritized.”

on sunday afternoon, police in englewood say they approached latrell allen, 20, under suspicion of carrying a gun. police allege allen then ran, pulled a gun and shot at officers who returned fire. allen is now recovering from multiple gunshot wounds. “police say a lot of things,” atkins said, pointing to the fact that the police did not have body camera footage of the incident.

to lightfoot, the police shooting was simply subterfuge for a larger criminal scheme. she warned against conflating the necessary conversations americans need to have about racial injustice and policing with criminal activity that often harms communities of color.

as the city’s first black female and openly gay mayor, lightfoot insists it’s important to lift the voices of organizers, activists and citizens seeking to upend legacies of injustice in chicago. but the looting this week represented something different to her.

“to see young people who are black act in the way that they acted, like they had every right to take somebody else’s property — and not just the big guys who have lots of insurance, but the little shop owners in neighborhoods all across the city — they have so little respect for all the sacrifice that people who look like them put into forming a business, all their hurdles, all their challenges that small businesses have,” lightfoot says. “particularly small businesses of color, without any regard for not only hurting those business owners but hurting also employees, who also are generally employees of color. that offends me to the core.”

on jeweler’s row along wabash avenue, in chicago’s central business district, some small business owners saw their entire livelihood wiped away. mohammad ashiq, the 60-year-old owner of watch clinic, entered his watch repair shop to discover all of his inventory, some $900,000 worth, had been stolen from his glass showcases. hundreds of watches for sale and in the process of being fixed for customers were missing. none of it insured. “it is my entire life,” he says as a nearby l-train rumbled above his store. “forty-two years in this business. i am left with nothing but my health.”

with such a risk hanging over business owners’ heads, many are now reassessing what they should do next. al wojtek macniak, 57 and his daughter, marta, 35, say they plan to move out their business, m&m jewelers, out of the ground-floor jeweler’s row storefront after looters broke into their building a second time in two months. “we moved here 10 years ago because we wanted the foot-traffic,” marta says. “but it’s no longer worth it to stay.”

lightfoot recognizes chicago is at an inflection point, as violent crime rises and the gulf of suspicion widens between the black community and her police force. she hopes she can bridge it. “the question is how do we find opportunity out of even these very dark days?” lightfoot asks. “and what we do to band together because together — it sounds like a cliche — but it is so true, we won’t survive this moment. we will not thrive. we will not move beyond, get stronger, and better if we don’t unite.”

"Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris",152,i9d54j,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/13/politics/trump-news-conference-birtherism-kamala-harris-biden-attacks-fact-check/index.html,69,1597398866.0,,"washington (cnn) president donald trump spent years pushing lies about the birthplace and presidential eligibility of president barack obama, the first black president.

on thursday, he started floating a new birther lie about sen. kamala harris, who, if elected, would be the first black and asian american vice president.

trump's incendiary nonsense about harris was part of a thursday self-described ""news conference"" he largely used to campaign against his democratic election opponents. trump also made a series of false claims about former vice president joe biden, democrats more broadly, and, again, about mail-in voting.

kamala harris's eligibility

trump was told about claims on ""social media"" that harris might be ineligible to serve as president and vice president. he was then asked if he can definitively say that she meets the requirements.

trump said, ""i heard today that she doesn't meet the requirements."" he referred to a lawyer who raised the issue in a newsweek article, chapman university professor john eastman, as ""very highly qualified.""

trump then said he has ""no idea"" whether it's true harris doesn't meet the requirements. he then asked the reporter if she was saying harris doesn't qualify because harris ""wasn't born in this country.""

facts first: harris was born in oakland, california. therefore, as a natural born citizen, she meets the constitution's requirements to serve as vice president or president. there is no serious question about this.

the fact that harris's parents were immigrants -- her father came from jamaica, her mother from india -- does not change the fact that she is indisputably eligible.

trump did say that he is not certain if harris is eligible or not; he concluded his comments by saying, ""i just heard about it, i'll take a look."" nonetheless, his just-asking-questions posture -- which he also employed with his obama birtherism -- doesn't change the fact that he gave credence to the conspiracy theory by praising the author of the article, saying he had heard harris is not eligible, and raising the possibility that harris was not born in the us.

trump spent the beginning of his news conference lambasting biden. here's a look at the facts around some of those attacks.

biden and pandemic plans

trump claimed that he has already done everything biden has called on him to do in responding to the pandemic.

""in fact, many of the things -- it was well reported over the last few days -- every single thing he said to do, every single thing, we did, and we did 'em well.""

facts first: it's not true that trump has done every single thing biden has called for. while there is certainly some overlap in biden's proposals and trump's actions, biden has made a number of proposals trump has not implemented.

for example, biden has called on trump to ""form a public health jobs corps -- hiring at least 100,000 americans to help build a data-driven disease surveillance system to spot and stem flare-ups before they spread."" trump has not done this.

biden has also called on trump to provide complete information on the state of testing around the country, ""including the number of tests completed, the results, and the average wait time for results."" the federal government does not provide this information on a systematic basis.

and biden has called for a greater federal role in providing medical supplies, proposing the creation of a ""supply commander to take command of the national supply chain."" trump has boasted of how well the federal government has helped with supplies, but he has also insisted that states should take the lead role in obtaining them

biden and a mask mandate

trump said that biden wanted to impose a federal mandate to force people to wear masks, questioning the authority of a president to do so.

""he wants the president of the united states, with the mere stroke of a pen,"" trump said of biden, ""to order over 300 million american citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months.""

""i guess this just happened, he thinks it's good politics i guess,"" trump continued.

facts first: on thursday, biden on thursday, biden said that governors -- not the federal government -- should impose a mask mandate. in june, however, biden said he would mandate masks ""from an executive standpoint.""

in a speech on the coronavirus thursday, biden argued that ""every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing.""

""every single american should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months at minimum,"" biden also said. ""it's not about your rights, it's about your responsibilities as an american.""

when asked on june 26 by the cnn affiliate in pittsburgh, kdka, if he would use his federal leverage to mandate wearing a mask biden said he would. ""yes, i would. from an executive standpoint, yes, i would,"" biden said.

biden was asked again if he would ""in effect mandate the wearing of masks,"" he replied, ""i would do everything [possible] to make it required that people had to wear masks in public.""

biden, immigration and the pandemic

trump claimed that biden's immigration policy, which trump described as ""ridiculous open borders,"" would be ""allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every us community.""

facts first: the coronavirus has already spread to every us state under trump's immigration policy; there's no basis for the suggestion that biden's immigration policy would be responsible for the existence of the pandemic around the country. and while biden is proposing a much less restrictive immigration policy than trump's, he is not proposing completely unfettered migration, as trump's the coronavirus has already spread to every us state under trump's immigration policy; there's no basis for the suggestion that biden's immigration policy would be responsible for the existence of the pandemic around the country. and while biden is proposing a much less restrictive immigration policy than trump's, he is not proposing completely unfettered migration, as trump's repeated ""open borders"" claim suggests.

biden and the press

the president, who has taken questions from the press every evening this week, criticized biden for allegedly doing the opposite.

""he refuses to take questions. he never takes questions,"" trump said. ""i take questions, he never takes questions. and you sort of wonder what's going on because they are not that difficult. some can be nasty, but they are not that difficult.""

facts first: while biden has been criticized for not taking more questions from the press, and while he certainly takes fewer than trump does, it is not true to suggest that he hasn't taken any. there have been several speeches where biden has taken while biden has been criticized for not taking more questions from the press, and while he certainly takes fewer than trump does, it is not true to suggest that he hasn't taken any. there have been several speeches where biden has taken questions as well as full interviews with the press. biden last held a formal media availability on july 28.

biden and schools

trump also accused biden of wanting to close schools and ""grind society to a halt"" through a federal decree.

about biden, trump said, ""he wants to shut down our economy, close our schools and grind society to a halt. and he wants it done by a federal decree.""

facts first: cnn could not find evidence of biden calling for a federal decree to close schools. instead, biden has offered a cnn could not find evidence of biden calling for a federal decree to close schools. instead, biden has offered a five-point plan for states to reopen schools, which focuses on stopping the spread of the virus ""with the safety of students and educators in mind.""

""everyone wants our schools to reopen. the question is how to make it safe, how to make it stick,"" biden said in a video accompanying the plan.

trump continued kicking around voting-related conspiracies.

democrats, schools and the election

trump claimed that democrats are trying to ""keep people away from the polls"" by keeping schools closed.

""some people say they don't want -- the democrats don't want -- schools open because that's where you have a lot of polling booths, and if you have a school closed you can't very easily have polling booths at the school,"" he said.

he concluded: ""maybe we'll be able to show that as fact.""

facts first: this is a conspiracy theory for which there is simply no evidence. (with his ""maybe"" line, trump seemed to implicitly suggest that he is not currently able to prove it.)

mail-in ballot origins

the president claimed that post offices are receiving millions of ballots and ""nobody knows from where.""

facts first: the ballots are coming from voters. though trump and his allies have previously the ballots are coming from voters. though trump and his allies have previously floated the possibility of political operatives sending fraudulent ballots that were not filled out by voters, states have multiple systems in place to verify the authenticity of each ballot, including matching signatures on ballots to the signature of the registered voter to whom it belongs.

trump also repeated a number of falsehoods he has made before, including claims that:"
Trump appointee deepens purge of U.S. global media agency,193,i9mtu0,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/12/trump-purge-us-agency-global-media-394403,23,1597443659.0,,"both men’s security clearances were suspended prior to an investigation on alleged agency security issues related to the hiring of foreign workers. they were also placed on administrative leave while the agency turns the wheels of actually firing both people.

turner joined usagm in february 2016 after a five-year stint as budget director of the millennium challenge corporation. he also worked for six years at the office of management and budget under presidents george w. bush and barack obama. turner also served as interim ceo of usagm from october 2019 to june of this year, prior to pack’s arrival.

the media agency is in turmoil over the recent arrival of pack, a steve bannon ally who pushed out the heads of voice of america, radio free europe/radio liberty and other outlets as he started as ceo.

in a statement, a usagm spokesperson said: “we took action today to restore integrity to and respect for the rule of law in our work at usagm. we will take additional steps to help return this agency to its glory days.”

turner said in a statement to politico: ""the reasons for my removal are without merit and simply retaliation for calling the ceo and his team to account for gross mismanagement of the agency.""

kligerman also said in a statement to politico: “there is no other conclusion to draw, except that it is in retaliation for attempting to do my job in an apolitical manner and to speak truth to power.”

he added: “i am a career civil servant who has faithfully supported the mission of the u.s. agency for global media over these past seven years, supporting republican and democratic leadership through two presidential administrations. as general counsel and consistent with my oath of office, my job has been to interpret and advise on the regulations, laws and constitution of the united states. i have done just that. my contributions have been repeatedly recognized and credited.”

john lansing, who served as usagm's ceo from 2015 to 2019, defended turner and kligerman, calling them ""highly professional"" and ""people who have served their country at the highest level for a number of years.""

""the hiring of foreign nationals was something that we took seriously and used a higher standard than what the office of personnel management required because of national security,"" he said. ""michael pack is using this as a smokescreen to cover up his efforts to deconstruct the legitimate and important journalism of voice of america.""

other usagm executives who were removed on wednesday include chief strategy officer shawn powers, deputy director for operations matt walsh, executive director oanh tran and director of management services marie lennon. none could be reached immediately for comment.

in reaction to the personnel shakeup on wednesday, amanda bennett, who was the head of voice of america until she resigned shortly after pack's arrival, said: ""the american people are going to be very very sorry when they wake up one day and find that by these individual actions — one at a time that nobody stopped — they’ve lost the functioning government they once had.

""what is happening at usagm is a microcosm of what’s happening all across the u.s. government — driving out honest, skilled, talented long serving professional public servants on trumped up charges and replacing them with people of no qualifications whose only attribute is loyalty. mccarthy couldn’t have done it better.”"

“we will have our regular pro forma meetings through the end of the state work period. if the speaker of the house and the minority leader of the senate decide to finally let another package move forward … it would take bipartisan consent to meet for legislative business sooner than scheduled,” mcconnell said as he wrapped up the senate until next month.

mcconnell added that he hoped the senate would be able to “act sometime soon.”

the four key negotiators have not met in person since friday, when the talks officially collapsed.

and the only contact to take place this week — mnuchin calling house speaker nancy pelosi nancy pelosibiden co-chair says wins in traditionally red states 'will give him some coattails and some leverage' with congress democratic hopes on health care rest with georgia senate races five takeaways from the battle for the senate more (d-calif.) on wednesday — resulted in dueling statements that only illustrated how stalemated the negotiations on coronavirus relief have become.

democrats entered negotiations with a package of approximately $3.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion and have offered to reduce that price tag by $1 trillion. republicans and the white house have refused to move from roughly $1 trillion.

""we are miles apart in our values,"" pelosi told reporters on thursday. ""perhaps you mistook them for somebody who gave a damn. that isn't the case. this is very far apart.""

asked when her next talk would be with mnuchin and meadows, pelosi responded, ""i don't know. when they come in with $2 trillion.""

white house economic adviser larry kudlow larry kudlowmore, speaking to reporters on thursday, said the talks are at a ""stalemate.""

""as secretary mnuchin said yesterday, the speaker wants a $2 trillion commitment from us. we're not going to give it. there are too many things, too many asks on their side that don't fit, don't have anything to do with covid, for that matter,"" he said.

beyond a top-line figure, the two sides haven’t resolved how much weekly unemployment benefits would be, how much money to give state and local governments or how to address mcconnell’s red line of liability protections for businesses that open back up. school funding, both the amount and how it's divided up, remains a sticking point as well.

the inaction comes as the unemployment rate is at 10.2 percent, down from a peak of 14.7 percent in april but still slightly higher than the peak during the great recession. and the country continues to report tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases per day, including reporting nearly 1,500 coronavirus deaths on wednesday in what is the highest number of daily deaths since mid-may.

mnuchin and meadows have been providing daily updates to senate republicans, but senators have said there is little reason to think a detente between congressional democrats and the administration is on the horizon.

the stalemate is taking place less than three months before the november election, injecting more politics into the dynamic compared to the four previous coronavirus relief bills that passed the senate with either no opposition or only a handful of “no” votes.

but even though the senate has been in session the week, the capitol has largely slid into its normal summer routine with only a handful of senators spotted around the chamber.

instead, the brief sessions have largely been used for senators to trade blame over the inability to get a deal, providing a daily look at how far apart the two sides are.

mcconnell on thursday accused democrats of holding an agreement “hostage” and “barely even pretending to negotiate,” while warning that voters were watching.

“by now the whole country knows what i’m talking about, the absurd issues which the democrats have turned into sticking points,” he said.

“he's gotta say something,” kaine said. “and, you know, i think he's done what he can do with the senate gop. when he candidly acknowledged, ‘look, there's gonna be at least 20 members of congress who won't vote for a single dollar’s worth of aid,’ he basically at that point is saying, ‘dems, you gotta work it out with the white house.’”"
Postal Service warns 46 states their voters could be disenfranchised by delayed mail-in ballots,431,i9smf6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/usps-states-delayed-mail-in-ballots/2020/08/14/64bf3c3c-dcc7-11ea-8051-d5f887d73381_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-high_uspsstates-230pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans,47,1597462418.0,,error
The Post Office Is Deactivating Mail Sorting Machines Ahead of the Election,13,i9vled,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wk9z/the-post-office-is-deactivating-mail-sorting-machines-ahead-of-the-election,5,1597472190.0,,"the united states postal service is removing mail sorting machines from facilities around the country without any official explanation or reason given, motherboard has learned through interviews with postal workers and union officials. in many cases, these are the same machines that would be tasked with sorting ballots, calling into question promises made by postmaster general louis dejoy that the usps has “ample capacity” to handle the predicted surge in mail-in ballots.

motherboard identified 19 mail sorting machines from five processing facilities across the u.s. that either have already been removed or are scheduled to be in the near future. but the postal service operates hundreds of distribution facilities around the country, so it is not clear precisely how many machines are getting removed and for what purpose.

even to local union officials, usps has not announced any policy, explained why they are doing this, what will happen to the machines and the workers who use them. nor has management provided a rationale for dismantling and removing the machines from the facility rather than merely not operating them when they’re not needed.

“i’m not sure you’re going to find an answer for why [the machines being removed] makes sense,” said iowa postal workers union president kimberly karol, “because we haven’t figured that out either.”

the postal workers motherboard spoke to said having machines removed, replaced, or modified is nothing new, but this time it seems to be more widespread, include a larger number of machines at their respective facility, and potentially impacts the facility’s ability to process large numbers of mail, including ballots, in a short time span.

“look at it this way: your local grocery store was forced to cut 1/3 of its cash-out lines, but management expected the same productivity, quality, and speed for the customer,” said an employee at a buffalo distribution facility, which they said is set to lose six out of 21 mail sorting machines. “it’s just never going to happen.”

after publication, usps spokesperson david partenheimer told motherboard, “the postal service routinely moves equipment around its network as necessary to match changing mail and package volumes. package volume is up, but mail volume continues to decline. adapting our processing infrastructure to the current volumes will ensure more efficient, cost effective operations and better service for our customers.”

do you work for the post office? do you know anything about sorting machines being removed from distribution facilities? we’d love to hear from you. email aaron gordon at aaron.gordon@vice.com.

while the consequences of this new policy are mostly unclear for now, it neatly fits with the sudden, opaque, and drastic changes made by dejoy, a longtime republican fundraiser and trump donor, in the less than two months he’s been postmaster general. like his other changes, including the curtailing of overtime resulting in the widespread mail delays and sudden reorganization of the entire usps, it is possible to see some semblance of corporate logic while second-guessing the decision to make drastic changes on the eve of the presidential election in which the usps will play a critical role.

most of the machines being dismantled in the facilities motherboard identified are delivery bar code sorters (dbcs), into which letters, postcards and similarly sized mail (but not magazines and large envelopes, which are categorized as “flats” and sorted differently) are fed. the dbcs sorts the mail into one of hundreds of “stackers,” a slot about a foot long. each slot is for a different destination, be it another post office or distribution facility.

a dbcs typically requires two workers to operate: one to feed the mail into the machine, and the other to collect the mail from the stackers and put them in the appropriate bins for transport. running at peak efficiency, the machines can sort about 35,000 pieces of mail per hour, a remarkable and oddly mesmerizing feat. but during times of short staffing or low mail volume—both of which have occurred during covid—dbcss can be run with one and a half or even just a single worker, albeit less productively.

marketing mail is down more than 15 percent through june of this year compared to last year. while this is a much steeper drop than recent years, it is continuing a decade-long trend of mail volume decline for everything but packages. in other words, dbcss have less mail to sort than they ever have before and it’s far from clear how much of that mail is ever coming back. so it stands to reason the usps might not need as many of them.

the postal workers interviewed by motherboard understood this, and in some cases even made the argument some dbcs machines might be of better use at other facilities. but they had other concerns about removing the machines altogether. if something goes wrong with the dbcss they have left, there are fewer machines to pick up the slack.

“when you take out one of the machines, it takes away our ability to respond to unforeseen things that may happen,” said karol, who added that although her facility in waterloo will have other dbcss, having fewer of them “limits our ability to respond” by making adjustments and moving mail around.

paul mckenna, president of milwaukee area local 3 of the american postal workers union, said that some of the dbcss staying will have about 50 more stackers added to them, meaning the machines can sort mail to a larger number of destinations. this will help alleviate the pressure during high mail volume periods like the christmas rush—when there is simply more mail in general to all places—as well as provide advantages during lower-volume periods like the dead of summer. but it won’t necessarily help the unique challenge of election mail. in that case, the mail surge stays local.

some letter carriers and distribution facility employees told motherboard election mail is often sorted by hand to ensure it gets handled promptly and properly, but this seems to vary by location.

that being said, this would only be a problem for voters who waited until the last minute to send back their ballots. if mail-in ballots are sent and returned over a period of weeks instead of days, it is unlikely, the postal workers said, to stress the machines even if some are taken away."
"Senate committee sought investigation of Bannon, raised concerns about Trump family testimony",13,ia0qvf,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-14/senate-committee-sought-investigation-of-bannon-raised-concerns-about-trump-family-testimony,3,1597492547.0,,"the senate intelligence committee has sent a bipartisan letter to the justice department asking federal prosecutors to investigate stephen k. bannon, a former trump confidant, for potentially lying to lawmakers during its investigation of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by the times, was signed by the panel’s then-chairman, republican sen. richard m. burr, and its ranking democrat, sen. mark warner.



for the record: a previous version of this article reported that the senate intelligence committee referred the bannon case to the u.s. attorney’s office after robert s. mueller iii testified to the panel about his investigation. the case was referred to the federal prosecutors three months after mueller’s report was released, but before he testified.



it also raised concerns about testimony provided by family members and confidants of president trump that appeared to contradict information provided by a former deputy campaign chairman to special counsel robert s. mueller iii. those it identified as providing such conflicting testimony were the president’s son donald trump jr., his son-in-law jared kushner, former trump campaign chairman paul manafort and former white house communications director hope hicks.

the letter, which has not before been made public, was sent july 19, 2019, to deborah curtis, a top prosecutor in the u.s. attorney’s office in washington. it is not clear what action the justice department has taken on the referral. kerri kupec, a justice department spokeswoman, declined to comment.

“as you are aware, the committee is conducting an investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election,” the letter states. “as part of that inquiry, and as a result of witness interviews and document production, we now have reason to believe that the following individuals may have committed a criminal act.”

the letter then names bannon, the chief executive of the 2016 trump campaign and later a top white house strategist, and two other men — erik prince, a private security contractor, and sam clovis, who served as co-chairman of trump’s campaign.

criminal referrals from capitol hill have been somewhat common since trump took office in 2017. but this one is rare because it involves the bipartisan leaders of a senate panel that conducted its own probe without devolving into the partisan bickering that consumed its counterpart in the house of representatives.

disclosure of the letter comes as the senate intelligence committee is close to releasing its final report on the panel’s own investigation into russian election meddling.

advertisement

“the committee will not discuss referrals,” said a spokesman for sen. marco rubio (r-fla.), the acting chairman of the committee. “and those who in order to score cheap political points are speculating on or claim to know the identities of those referred are committing a grotesque injustice.”

rubio took over the chairmanship after burr stepped down amid an investigation into insider trading ahead of the pandemic.

a spokeswoman for warner declined to comment.

according to the letter, the committee believed bannon may have lied about his interactions with erik prince, a private security contractor; rick gerson, a hedge fund manager; and kirill dmitriev, the head of a russian sovereign fund.

advertisement

all were involved in closely scrutinized meetings in the seychelles before trump’s inauguration.

the committee also believed prince, best known as the founder of the former mercenary company blackwater and the brother of education secretary betsy devos, may have lied about his interactions with dmitriev.

no charges were filed in connection with the meetings. but investigators suspected that the men may have been seeking to arrange a clandestine back-channel between the incoming trump administration and moscow. it’s unclear from the committee’s letter what bannon and prince might have lied about, but he and prince have told conflicting stories about the seychelles meeting.

prince said he returned to the united states and updated bannon about his conversations; bannon said that never happened, according to the special counsel’s office.

advertisement

“it’s impossible to respond to something i’ve never heard about before,” said william burck, a lawyer for bannon. burck said he never heard from the u.s. attorney’s office about his client.

matthew l. schwartz, a lawyer for prince, defended his client’s cooperation with capitol hill and mueller’s office.

“there is nothing new for the department of justice to consider, nor is there any reason to question the special counsel’s decision to credit mr. prince and rely on him in drafting its report,” he said.

the committee also asked the justice department to investigate sam clovis, a former co-chairman of the trump campaign, for possibly lying about his interactions with peter w. smith, a republican donor who led a secret effort to obtain former secretary of state hillary clinton’s missing emails.

clovis could not be reached.

in the two page-letter, the committee raised concerns that testimony given to it by the president’s family and advisors contradicted what rick gates, the former deputy campaign chairman, told the special counsel about when people within the trump campaign knew about a june 9 meeting at trump tower with a russian lawyer.

when the meeting became public, trump jr. initially claimed it was about russian adoptions, but emails written by trump jr. that were later made public showed he had agreed to the meeting, but because he had been assured that the russian lawyer had “official documents and information” that would “incriminate” clinton, the democratic candidate for president. the email said the information would “be very useful to your father.”

the music promoter who arranged the meeting, rob goldstone, told trump jr. that the damaging information on clinton was “part of russia and its government’s support for mr. trump.” trump jr. replied: “if it’s what you say, i love it.”

advertisement

gates, a longtime deputy to manafort, was one of the highest-ranking trump campaign advisors to “flip” on the president, and he was a foundational witness during the mueller investigation.

gates told the special prosecutor that in the days before the june 9, 2016, meeting, trump jr. announced at a “regular morning meeting of senior campaign staff and trump family members that he had a lead on negative information about the clinton foundation,” according to the report of the investigation’s findings.

trump jr., kushner, hicks and manafort denied prior knowledge of the meeting in interviews with the committee, according to the committee’s letter, which offered transcripts as proof. a white house spokeswoman, as well as lawyers for kushner and hicks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“we are fully confident in the testimony and information provided by donald j. trump, jr.,” said alan futerfas, a lawyer for the president’s son.

advertisement

lying to congress is a felony, and two trump allies — michael cohen, his former lawyer, and roger stone, his longtime political advisor and self-described dirty trickster — were charged with the crime during the special counsel investigation. cohen pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison, though he was recently released on home confinement due to the covid-19 pandemic.

stone was convicted at trial. atty. gen. william barr caused an uproar when he waded into the case and pressed prosecutors to reduce their recommended sentence. after four career prosecutors left the case in protest, a federal judge sentenced stone to just over three years in prison. trump last month commuted stone’s sentence just before he was supposed to report to prison.

the committee’s referral to the u.s. attorney’s office came after mueller’s report was released. the office has battled turnover since early this year."

washington (ap) — president donald trump greeted the democratic presidential ticket of joe biden and kamala harris this past week with a litany of distortion and falsehoods, raging against cases of voting fraud where they didn’t exist and declining to quash conspiracy theories about harris’ eligibility for office.

trump also misrepresented biden’s position on taxes, again minimized the coronavirus threat and exaggerated his own record on the economy.

a look at some of the past week’s rhetoric and the facts:

on biden-harris

trump: “if biden would win ... he’s going to double and triple everybody’s taxes.” — news conference wednesday.

the facts: trump is exaggerating. wildly so.

biden would raise taxes, primarily on the wealthy. but a july estimate by the committee for a responsible federal budget finds that the increase is a small fraction of what trump claimed. the former vice president’s plan would raise “taxes for the top 1 percent of earners by 13 to 18% of after-tax income, while indirectly increasing taxes for most other groups by 0.2 to 0.6%,” the nonpartisan group said.

to put that in perspective, tax collections would increase by $3.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion over the next decade. that is a lot of money. but it’s not a doubling or tripling. the government is on pace to collect $47 trillion over the next decade, so the biden plan would be roughly be a 7.8% increase in revenues.

trump, asked about social media claims that harris is not eligible to run for vice president because her parents were immigrants to the u.s.: “i heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements. ... i have no idea if that’s right. i would have assumed that the democrats would have checked that out.” — news conference thursday.

trump, asked about the subject again: “i have nothing to do with it. i read something about it,” trump said saturday during a news conference. he added: “it’s not something that bothers me. ... it’s not something that we will be pursuing.” asked point blank if harris is eligible, trump replied: “i just told you. i have not got into it in great detail.” — news conference saturday.

the facts: harris, a senator from california, is without question eligible.

harris, 55, was born in oakland, california, making her a natural-born u.s. citizen and eligible to be president if biden were unable to serve a full term. her father, an economist from jamaica, and her mother, a cancer researcher from india, met at the university of california, berkeley, as graduate students.

the constitution requires a vice president to meet the eligibility requirements to be president. that includes being a natural-born u.s. citizen, at least 35 years old and a resident in the u.s. for at least 14 years.

advertisement

“i can’t believe people are making this idiotic comment,” laurence tribe, a harvard university professor of constitutional law, told the associated press in 2019, when similar false claims emerged about harris during her presidential run.

“she is a natural born citizen and there is no question about her eligibility to run,” tribe said.

harris is the first black woman and asian american to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket. trump in past years indulged in the false conspiracy theory that president barack obama was born abroad.

___

trump campaign: “not long ago, kamala harris called joe biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received.” -- statement tuesday from katrina pierson, trump 2020 senior adviser.

the facts: she never called biden a racist.

pierson appears to be referring to harris’ remarks during a democratic primary debate in miami in june 2019 when the california senator challenged biden’s record of opposing busing as a way to integrate schools in the 1970s.

harris prefaced her criticism by telling biden at that time, “i do not believe you are a racist. i agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.”

she then went on: “it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing.

“there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools,” harris said. “she was bused to school every day. that little girl was me.”

it was a breakthrough moment for harris at the candidates’ first debate, stunning biden, who responded that “he did not praise racists” and provided a hairsplitting defense of his position on busing. but she did not accuse him of being racist.

___

social security

trump: “at the end of the year, the assumption that i win, i’m going to terminate the payroll tax ... we’ll be paying into social security through the general fund.” — news conference wednesday.

the facts: under trump’s proposal, social security would lose its dedicated funding source.

payroll taxes raise about $1 trillion annually for social security, and the president was unconcerned about the loss of those revenues. trump campaign officials stressed that the general fund consists of assets and liabilities that finance government operations and could do so for social security. the general fund is nicknamed “america’s checkbook” on the treasury department’s website.

the risk is that the loss of a dedicated funding source could destabilize an anti-poverty program that provides payments to roughly 65 million americans. it also could force people to cut back on the spending that drives growth so they can save for their own retirement and health care needs if they believe the government backstop is in jeopardy.

a 12.4% payroll tax split between employers and workers funds social security, while a 2.9% payroll tax finances medicare. the social security tax raised roughly $1 trillion last year, according to government figures. over a 10-year period, trump’s idea would blow a $13 trillion hole in a u.s. budget that is already laden with rising debt loads.

trump announced a payroll tax deferral through the end of the year, part of a series of moves to bypass congress after talks on a broader coronavirus relief bill that has stalled. he says he will make it a permanent tax cut with the help of congress. democrats have described that idea as a nonstarter.

white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany on thursday suggested to reporters that trump misspoke when he said he would eliminate the payroll tax if reelected. she said the president would only push to make the payroll tax deferrals permanent. but trump clearly said that he would eliminate the payroll tax four times at his wednesday press briefing and even answered a question about “permanently” rescinding it.

___

trump, asked how the general fund can sustain the payments: “we’re going to have tremendous growth. ... you will see growth like you have not seen in a long time.” — news conference wednesday.

the facts: it is highly unlikely that economic growth would be enough to offset the loss of the payroll tax. trump has a record of making wildly improbable growth projections. he suggested that his 2017 income tax cuts would propel economic growth as high as 6% annually. that never happened. growth reached 3% in 2018, then slumped to 2.2% and the u.s. economy crumbled into recession this year because of the coronavirus.

___

virus threat

trump, on covid-19: “nobody understood it because nobody has ever seen anything like this. the closest thing is, in 1917, they say — right? the great — the great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing, where they lost, anywhere from 50 to 100 million people. probably ended the second world war; all the soldiers were sick.” — news briefing monday.

the facts: he got the year wrong for the spanish flu, as he routinely does, and may have overstated deaths from it. the pandemic spread from early 1918 to late 1920. it killed an estimated 50 million worldwide, with about 675,000 of the deaths in the u.s., according to the centers for disease control and prevention.

that pandemic did not end world war ii, which came two decades later.

___

trump: “we’re still in the pandemic, which will be going away, as i say, it will be going away. and they scream, how you can you say that? i said, because it’s going to be going away.” — interview thursday on fox business network.

the facts: no matter how many times he says it, the virus is not going to just magically disappear.

the virus is now blamed for more than 166,000 deaths and more than 5.2 million confirmed infections in the u.s. — easily the highest totals in the world. in the past week, the average number of new cases per day was on the rise in eight states, and deaths per day were climbing in 26, according to an associated press analysis.

dr. anthony fauci, the government’s top infectious diseases official, has warned that increased cases across the south and west in particular put “the entire country at risk.” on thursday, for instance, the rate of positive virus cases in texas soared to the highest levels of the pandemic, with nearly 1 in every 4 coronavirus tests coming back positive. nevada had its biggest daily jump in coronavirus fatalities to date.

in february, trump asserted coronavirus cases were going “very substantially down, not up,” and said it will be fine because “in april, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.”

fauci says there “certainly” will be coronavirus infections in the fall and winter.

___

trump, on whether he still thinks kids are essentially immune from covid-19: “yeah, i think that, for the most part, they do very well. i mean, they — they don’t get very sick. they don’t catch it easily.” — news briefing tuesday.

the facts: they aren’t immune, and he ignores racial disparities among those kids who get infected.

although it’s true that children are less likely than adults to develop covid-19, the cdc has nevertheless counted more than 250,000 infections by the virus in americans younger than 18, or roughly 7% of all cases. racial disparities in the u.s. outbreak also extend to children, with hispanic and black children with covid-19 more likely to be hospitalized than white kids.

the total number of kids who have been infected but not confirmed is almost certainly far higher than the cdc figures, experts say, because those with mild or no symptoms are less likely to get tested. trump also glosses over the fact that kids can spread disease without showing symptoms themselves.

the cdc in may also warned doctors to be on the lookout for a rare but life-threatening inflammatory reaction in some children who’ve had the coronavirus. the condition had been reported in more than 100 children in new york, and in some kids in several other states and in europe, with some deaths.

two recent government reports laid bare the racial disparities.

one of the cdc reports looked at children with covid-19 who needed hospitalization. hispanic children were hospitalized at a rate eight times higher than white kids, and black children were hospitalized at a rate five times higher, it found.

the second report examined cases of the rare virus-associated syndrome in kids. it found that nearly three-quarters of the children with the syndrome were either hispanic or black, well above their representation in the general population.

___

economy

trump: “the manufacturing sector is booming and the production index is at the highest reading since october of ’18, which was an extraordinary period of time.” — news conference wednesday.

the facts: the pandemic crushed u.s. factories and the damage persists. there is no boom.

even after three months of job gains, the u.s. bureau of labor statistics shows the manufacturing sector has 740,000 fewer jobs than before the outbreak. all the factory hiring gains under trump have disappeared. there were 257,000 more manufacturing jobs on the day trump became president than now. more important, the jobs recovery has shown signs of stalling. just 26,000 factory jobs were added in july, down from 357,000 added jobs in june.

the sector has been recovering. yet after increases in production in june, the federal reserve said u.s. factory output was running 11.1% below pre-pandemic levels. trump cited one component of an index composed by the institute for supply management that indicates factory production grew in july as well. it was the best reading since august of 2018, not october as claimed by the president. but that same report showed that manufacturers are also cutting back on employment, suggesting that a boom has yet to begin.

trump, on tariffs on china: “we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars from china. we never took 10 cents from china, never -- not even 10 cents.” — news conference monday.

the facts: it’s false to say the u.s. never collected a dime in tariffs on chinese goods before he took action. they are simply higher in some cases than they were before. it’s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by china. tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from u.s. businesses and consumers, not from china. tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically.

mail voting

trump: universal mail-in voting is “a system riddled by fraud and corruption.” — news conference wednesday.

the facts: voting fraud actually is very rare.

the brennan center for justice in 2017 ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.

five states relied on mail-in ballots even before the coronavirus pandemic raised concerns about voting in person.

“trump is simply wrong about mail-in balloting raising a ‘tremendous’ potential for fraud,” richard l. hasen, an elections expert at the university of california, irvine, school of law, wrote recently. “while certain pockets of the country have seen their share of absentee-ballot scandals, problems are extremely rare in the five states that rely primarily on vote-by-mail, including the heavily republican state of utah.”

new york voting

trump: “you just look at what happened with the carolyn maloney race. they should do that race over, by the way. ... when you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing, and the ballot frauds — nobody knows what’s going on with that race, and yet they declared her a winner.” — news conference wednesday.

the facts: there’s no evidence of fraud in the democratic congressional primary in new york city that was won by democratic rep. carolyn maloney. nor did trump offer any proof of fraud.

new york state decided to allow anyone to vote by mail in the june primary because of the pandemic. more than 400,000 people voted by absentee ballot in new york city, a figure that was 10 times the number of absentee ballots cast in the 2016 primary.

opening and counting those ballots by elections officials took weeks, leading to a legal dispute over nonfraud issues, such as missing postmarks. candidates observing the count say that thousands of ballots were disqualified because of technical errors voters wouldn’t have encountered if they had voted in person, like problems with their signature.

new york city’s board of elections ultimately certified the results six weeks after the election.

a former minneapolis police officer involved in george floyd’s arrest told investigators that he was focused on crowd control and minimized his role in the actions that led to floyd’s death, video of the interview shows.

tou thao, one of four former officers charged in floyd’s death, described himself as a “human traffic cone” as he held back onlookers who became increasingly horrified at the police officers’ actions, the star tribune reported , citing video that was released friday. floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a white officer, derek chauvin, pressed his knee against floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes on may 25 as floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe and as bystanders pleaded with officers to help him.

“i don’t want anyone to die,” thao told an investigator who asked what his reaction was to floyd’s death. “it was kind of a somber moment, especially for me. my heart kind of sank.”

thao voluntarily participated in the 1-hour, 40-minute interview with the minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension eight days after floyd’s death. he said that as the bystanders got louder, he became worried they might rush chauvin and two other officers who were holding floyd on the ground.

thao and chauvin had responded to the scene to help two officers, thomas lane and j. kueng, who were attempting to arrest floyd for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store.

while they were on the way, thao said that dispatch canceled the backup call. but thao, who was driving, said he felt compelled to respond because lane and kueng were new officers and the intersection was known to be “especially hostile” to police.

thao said floyd appeared to be on drugs, resisted arrested and used his legs get out of a squad car. as the officers restrained floyd on the ground, thao said he heard floyd say he couldn’t breathe, adding, “but then he was obviously yelling and talking.”

thao also said he has never used the maneuver that chauvin used to pin floyd to the ground.

although a woman who identified herself as a minneapolis firefighter approached thao and demanded that officers check floyd’s pulse, thao told investigators that his job was securing the scene and that he couldn’t “be in two places at once.”

thao, lane and kueng are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. all four officers were fired and are scheduled for trial in march. floyd’s death sparked protests around the globe against racial injustice and police brutality.

the video of thao’s interview was made available friday after minnesota attorney general keith ellison’s office filed it to support a motion to have all four officers tried jointly.

the next court hearing for the four is scheduled for sept. 11."
South Dakota declines unemployment aid from Trump executive orders,227,iakuxb,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/512177-south-dakota-declines-unemployment-aid-from-trump-executive-orders,39,1597574797.0,,"south dakota appeared to become the first state to decline boosted federal unemployment aid that was designated under an executive order signed by president trump donald john trump republican philadelphia official responsible for vote counting says office getting death threats biden will call governors, mayors about mask mandate trump campaign voter fraud hotline flooded with prank calls more this month amid the continuing pandemic.

“my administration is very grateful for the additional flexibility that this effort would have provided, but south dakota is in the fortunate position of not needing to accept it. south dakota’s economy, having never been shut down, has recovered nearly 80% of our job losses. south dakota is the only state in the nation that didn’t have extended benefits kick in because our insured unemployment rate has been the lowest in the nation,” she said in a statement.

trump signed an executive order earlier this month allowing the federal government to use money already allocated for disaster assistance to help unemployed americans, adding at least $300 more to their weekly benefit amounts, with state governments expected to provide an additional $100, for a total of $400.

the order came after white house officials and congressional democratic leaders were unable to come to an agreement about coronavirus legislation earlier this month. the $600-per-week enhanced unemployment insurance provided to americans under the march cares act expired in late july.

but the order blindsided many states, some of which are still reeling from the pandemic’s economic repercussions and may not be in a position to add their part of the benefits boost.

washington (ap) — president donald trump has found a new doctor for his coronavirus task force — and this time there’s no daylight between them.

trump last week announced that dr. scott atlas , a frequent guest on fox news channel, has joined the white house as a pandemic adviser. atlas, the former chief of neuroradiology at stanford university medical center and a fellow at stanford’s conservative hoover institution, has no expertise in public health or infectious diseases.

but he has long been a critic of coronavirus lockdowns and has campaigned for kids to return to the classroom and for the return of college sports, just like trump.

“scott is a very famous man who’s also very highly respected,” trump told reporters as he introduced the addition. “he has many great ideas and he thinks what we’ve done is really good.”

atlas’ hiring comes amid ongoing tensions between the president and drs. anthony fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, and deborah birx, the task force’s coordinator. while birx remains closely involved in the administration’s pandemic response, both she and fauci have publicly contradicted the rosy picture the president has painted of a virus that has now killed more than 167,000 people in the united states and infected millions nationwide.

atlas, the sole doctor to share the stage at trump’s pandemic briefings this past week, has long questioned polices that have been embraced by public health experts both in the u.s. and abroad. he has called it a “good thing” for younger, healthy people to be exposed to the virus, while falsely claiming children are at near “zero risk.”

in an april op-ed in the hill newspaper, atlas bemoaned that lockdowns may have prevented the development of “natural herd immunity.”

“in the absence of immunization, society needs circulation of the virus, assuming high-risk people can be isolated,” he wrote.

full coverage: virus outbreak

in television appearances, atlas has called on the nation to “get a grip” and argued that “there’s nothing wrong” with having low-risk people get infected, as long as the vulnerable are protected.

“it doesn’t matter if younger, healthier people get infected. i don’t know how often that has to be said. they have nearly zero risk of a problem from this,” he said in one appearance . “when younger, healthier people get infected, that’s a good thing,” he went on to say, “because that’s exactly the way that population immunity develops.”

advertisement

while younger people are certainly at far lower risk of developing serious complications from the virus, they can still spread it to others who may be more vulnerable, even when they have no symptoms. and while their chances of dying are slim, some do face severe complications, with one study finding that 35% of young adults had not returned to normal health two weeks to three weeks after testing positive.

but atlas’ thinking closely aligns with trump’s perspective on the virus, which he has played down since its earliest days. while trump eventually supported the lockdowns that once helped slow the disease’s spread, he has since pressured states to reopen schools and businesses as he tries to revive a battered economy before the november election.

public health experts have long bemoaned trump’s efforts to politicize the virus and have encouraged him to let doctors and scientists lead the nation’s response. but they questioned the decision to bring on atlas, whose expertise is in magnetic resonance imaging and whose research has focused on factors impacting health care policy.

“i think he’s utterly unqualified to help lead a covid response,” said lawrence gostin, a georgetown university law professor who specializes in public health. “his medical degree isn’t even close to infectious diseases and public health and he has no experience in dealing with public health outbreaks.”

“its very clear to me,” gostin added, “that the president brought on somebody who will just be a mouthpiece for his agenda and a ‘yes’ person.” gostin expressed concern that trump was sidelining other doctors, including birx and fauci, because he had soured on their advice.

“in the face of an epidemic that’s killing hundreds of thousands of americans, that’s unforgivable,” he said. “you want clear independent advice from people with long experience in fighting novel pandemics and he has none of those credentials.”

kavita patel, a primary care physician and health policy expert who served in the obama white house, said there’s little that can prepare a doctor for the crucible of a presidential staff, let alone working for the famously volatile trump.

“i expect dr. atlas’ time will be marked with highs and lows and hopefully he will realize that the country really needs credible expertise and guidance, not partisan bias,” said patel. “by being partisan or political while having such an important (role), doctors undermine their credibility and ultimately dilute the role of science.”

white house spokesman judd deere, in a statement, praised atlas as “a world renowned physician and scholar” and dismissed questions about atlas’ qualifications.

“we are all in this fight together, and only the media would distort and diminish dr. atlas’ highly acclaimed career simply because he has come to serve the president,” he said.

deere declined to say how long atlas, who is now a paid special government employee, has been advising the president, and insisted his addition would not diminish the roles of fauci and birx.

paul e. peterson, director of the program on education policy and governance at harvard university and a senior fellow at hoover with atlas, praised atlas as “a really brilliant guy” with “a tremendous knowledge base” about the virus. peterson said atlas is someone who conducts ”the most rigorous and careful research before he comes to a conclusion.”

some colleagues have found atlas abrasive. but peterson, who has written several op-eds with atlas advocating the reopening of schools and who appeared with atlas at a white house event this past week, praised atlas as “delightful to work with” and stressed the value of trump having input from people with a variety of backgrounds.

“if you get a variety of people from one perspective or one kind of training out there, that’s not desirable,” he said. “it’s extremely important to have diversity on the advisory board.”

"British far right ‘becoming more racist’ after Black Lives Matter protests, report finds",70,ib12pg,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/far-right-black-lives-matter-protests-racism-patriotic-alternative-hope-not-hate-a9672401.html,27,1597642899.0,,"the british far right is becoming more openly racist in the wake of a backlash against international black lives matter protests, experts have warned.

a report by hope not hate, seen exclusively by the independent before its release, said that years of dominance by tommy robinson and other figures focused on muslims was giving way to rising white nationalism.

it found that the growth of the new patriotic alternative group, which openly calls for non-whites to be ejected from the uk, suggests a “shift towards more openly racial politics”.

author simon murdoch said far-right activists were becoming “much more extreme ideologically”.

he said the increase in migrant boat crossings over the english channel and anger over so-called “cancel culture” had an impact.

“the biggest backlash has been to the black lives matter movement,” the researcher added. “there is more willingness to discuss race generally across the far right now.”

large protests following the police killing of george floyd in the us city of minneapolis in may sparked a deluge of racism and anger on far-right social media networks.

claims that demonstrators were to target the statue of winston churchill and other monuments in london, after a slave trader’s figure was torn down in bristol, culminated in a violent protest by groups claiming to “defend” them.

police and journalists were attacked and some protesters appeared to perform nazi salutes, following smaller clashes elsewhere in the uk where demonstrators were filmed making “white power” gestures and shouting: “why don’t you go back to africa?”

mr murdoch said that dominant groups and activists in the british far right, such as robinson, have focused on islam in recent years and left overt racism to the “extreme fascists” like banned terrorist group national action.

but the rise of the europe-wide identitarian movement and spread of a conspiracy theory claiming that white people are being “replaced” by non-whites has influenced extremists in the uk.

“there’s this move from people previously focused on other topics like islam, and alongside that is a contingent of the young british far right who have been embracing more extreme and traditionally fascist, white nationalist and antisemitic ideas,” mr murdoch said.

he warned that the younger group are active in online networks that have greater reach than the “old guard” of national front and british national party (bnp) supporters.

patriotic alternative was formed last year by the bnp’s former director of publicity, mark collett, and has been attracting activists from across the far-right spectrum.

its growth has sparked concerns it may unite competing factions from the fractured extreme right-wing scene in britain.

last weekend, it held publicity stunts displaying “white lives matter” banners across the uk to to tie in with the international day of the world's indigenous peoples, and leaders are planning a third national conference in september.

on its website, patriotic alternative claims that “native british” people are being eradicated and proposes extreme measures to protect “the indigenous peoples of the united kingdom”.

it says it would call a “complete halt” to immigration and pay people “of immigrant descent … to return to their ancestral homelands”.

patriotic alternative claims that children are being exposed to pro-lgbt and anti-white “propaganda” and advocates home-schooling using its own package of hateful material on “history and culture”.

patriotic alternative’s website calls for non-whites to ‘return to their ancestral homelands’

mr murdoch said the group had attracted support from figures previously active in neo-nazi groups, but also those with backgrounds in “more moderate” movements.

he warned that patriotic alternative was “trying to give the friendliest possible face to extremely fascist ideas” by using veiled terminology.

but hope not hate’s report found that private online chats between members were “awash with extreme racism, holocaust denial and open veneration of fascism”.

it said patriotic alternative had “antisemitism at its core” and played into conspiracy theories claiming jews are orchestrating the “replacement” of white britons.

one post by a supporter seen by the independent reads: “british people are white. they aren’t brown, black, asian or jew.”

hope not hate also found patriotic alternative had links with the uk-based hundred handers group, which incites people to spread racist stickers around the world with slogans including “western civilisation is white civilisation” and “stop immigration, start repatriation”.

mr murdoch said it appeared to be capitalising on a “sense of rootlessness” in the british far right during the coronavirus pandemic.

“black lives matter, the anti-government elements of coronavirus and the economic downturn are grist to the mill for them but they’ve lacked a sense of direction,” he added.

“despite grossly exaggerating their size and influence, patriotic alternative could be the group that unites the fractured, ageing uk far right, injecting it with young activists."

why it matters: democratic lawmakers say they have been inundated with complaints about policy changes by postmaster general louis dejoy that are disrupting the usps ahead of an election that will see a record number of mail-in ballots. dejoy is a former fundraiser for president trump, who defended him this weekend.

the backdrop: in a ""dear democratic colleague"" letter on sunday evening, pelosi said: ""alarmingly, across the nation, we see the devastating effects of the president’s campaign to sabotage the election by manipulating the postal service to disenfranchise voters.""

democrats say constituents are furious about news of the removal of high-speed sorting machines, unbolting of corner mailboxes, and a postal service warning to state that ballots may not be delivered in time to be counted.

democrats plan to keep the issue highly visible, even before the unusual interruption of their time at home in the run-up to the election.""

""to save the postal service,"" pelosi wrote, ""i am also calling upon members to participate in a day of action on tuesday by appearing at a post office in their districts for a press event.""

details: the expected starting point for legislative action will be a measure introduced by house oversight chair carolyn maloney (d-n.y.), the ""delivering for america act,"" which ""would prohibit the postal service from dialing back levels of service it had in place"" on jan. 1 until the pandemic ends.

maloney has also called on dejoy to testify about changes he's made at an ""urgent"" house oversight committee hearing on aug. 14.

the other side: meanwhile, senate minority chuck schumer (d-n.y.) issued a statement sunday evening demanding that majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) reconvene the senate.

mcconnell said at an event monday that he has no plans to do so, and that the usps ""is going to be just fine,"" according to ap.

mcconnell also distanced himself from trump's complaints, saying: ""we’re going to make sure that the ability to function going into the election is not adversely affected. and i don’t share the president’s concerns.""

trump said this weekend that dejoy ""wants to make the post office great again."""

Voters in North Carolina have received absentee ballot request forms in the mail with Trump's face on them,323,ibg1d0,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/postal-service-trump-absentee-ballot-request-mail-usps/index.html,59,1597706224.0,,"(cnn) given the crisis facing the united states postal service before a presidential election, the last thing john herter expected to receive in the mail saturday was an absentee ballot request form with president donald trump's face on it.

""is this a joke?"" herter said his wife told him as she opened up the mailer to reveal a photo of trump grinning underneath the words, ""are you going to let the democrats silence you? act now to stand with president trump.""

herter, of lincoln county is among a group of voters in north carolina to receive the mailer over the past few days after trump said that he opposed crucial usps funding because he doesn't want to see it used for mail-in voting this november.

the pandemic has led to high levels of voting-by-mail, but the president has tried to restrict this method because he said it is filled with fraud and abuse, claims that cnn has fact-checked multiple times and which are largely without merit.

trump has criticized mail-in voting for months, baselessly asserting that it will lead to voter fraud.

this is why chandler carranza, of gaston county, north carolina, said he laughed after receiving the absentee ballot request mailer on thursday.

""the irony is very thick and definitely not lost on me,"" carranza told cnn. ""trump has been saying mail-in ballots will bring fraud to the election but absentee ballots are legit. which is it? it can't be both ways. i laughed because if the campaign actually took information from other times they have reached out to me, they'd know i won't vote for trump despite being a registered republican.""

got my mail in absentee ballot request form from @realdonaldtrump that will allow me to mail in my vote if i need to... but i can't remember if this is a good thing or bad thing. mail in is bad but absentee is good??? 🙄🙄🙄 pic.twitter.com/fbdgiq4hwc — chandler carranza (@chandlerc226) august 13, 2020

the trump campaign said the mailer shows how it ""is working to ensure voters in every state know how their state's sorting system works so that every eligible voter can cast their ballot and have their vote counted,"" thea mcdonald, deputy national press secretary, told cnn over email after she was shown the mailer.

""president trump has consistently and rightly said that where a voter cannot make it to the polls, they should request an absentee ballot,"" mcdonald said. ""the president has also correctly distinguished between chaos-ridden universal mail-in voting systems, like the one that led to california's train wreck primary, and traditional absentee mail voting systems, like the tried and true system in north carolina—a distinction democrats and many in the mainstream media purposely ignore to sow confusion.""

the mailer was sent out by the north carolina republican party, press secretary tim wigginton told cnn. the state party has sent several statewide mailers ""to make it easier for interested voters to participate,"" wigginton said.

""we want our voters to know they can utilize this tool to cast their ballot in an easy, safe and secure manner. it is important to note that the north carolina system requires a voter to actively solicit a ballot and go through an easy but important verification process to request a ballot,"" he added. ""we along with president trump oppose an all-mail election process where voters are mailed ballots without a prior request and authentication.""

the usps has come under criticism recently. newly released letters from the usps have warned nearly every state that slowdowns in delivery could cause ballots to show up late and not be counted. cnn and other news organizations also reported that in the last week that usps has removed letter collection boxes in at least four states: new york, oregon, montana and indiana.

the usps announced sunday it would stop removing postal collection boxes through late november following complaints about how some had been taken away.

house democrats said sunday they are ""ramping up"" their investigation of the united states postal service and as democratic leaders, including house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer, called on postmaster general louis dejoy and chairman of the postal service board of governors robert duncan to testify.

possible action by the house could include forbidding the postal service to change sorting devices, prevent the closure of facilities, stopping any effort to end overtime pay or changing the timing of mail delivery, one of the sources said. democrats also may push language requiring all ballot deliveries to have first class status.

while it is common for candidates and political parties to send mail to voters, especially those who don't have access to tv or the internet, real facts nc , a non-profit dedicated to researching and telling the stories about issues facing north carolinians, has never seen a mailer like this before, messaging director jazmynne williams told cnn.

one voter concerned over the problems facing the usps is taylor alexander, of wake county, north carolina. she received the absentee ballot request form on wednesday.

""my initial reaction was that i was kind of shocked, and laughed because of the irony of it, because trump had been railing against mail-in voting, but here his party was, promoting it, and sending out an absentee ballot request form,"" alexander said. ""i think it's ridiculous that the funding is being cut and processes are being changed in the post office. people's life saving medication are days late, bills aren't being paid on time, and all for what? it's rigging the election."""
"Defying Trump, 4 Automakers Lock In a Deal on Greenhouse Gas Pollution",281,ibnlsa,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/climate/california-automakers-pollution.html,52,1597729261.0,,"washington — california on monday finalized a legal settlement with five of the world’s largest automakers that binds them to comply with its stringent state-level fuel efficiency standards that would cut down on climate-warming tailpipe emissions.

monday’s agreement adds legal teeth to a deal that california and four of the companies outlined in principle last summer, and it comes as a rejection of president trump’s new, looser federal rules on fuel economy, which would allow more pollution into the atmosphere.

mr. trump was blindsided last summer when the companies — ford, honda, bmw and volkswagen — announced that they had reached a secret deal with california to comply with that state’s standards, even as the trump administration was working to roll back obama-era rules on fuel economy. a fifth company, volvo, said in march that it intended to join the agreement and is part of the legal settlement that was finalized on monday.

after last summer’s announcement, mr. trump escalated his legal and rhetorical attacks on california. he accelerated the release of a rule to revoke california’s legal authority to set its own state-level standards, writing on twitter that doing so would “produce far less expensive cars for the consumer, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer.” his administration dismissed the california deal as a meaningless “voluntary stunt.”"

new york (ap) — nearly two decades after the slaying of run-dmc star jam master jay, federal prosecutors said monday they have solved one of new york city’s most enduring mysteries, charging two men from his neighborhood with murder and suggesting that the hip-hop artist — celebrated for his anti-drug stance — was ambushed over a cocaine deal.

the suspects were identified in court papers as ronald washington, 56, who is currently serving a federal prison sentence stemming from a string of robberies while on the run from police after jay’s 2002 death, and karl jordan jr., 36, who is also charged with engaging in a cocaine distribution conspiracy in 2017.

jason “jay” mizell, known professionally as jam master jay, formed run-dmc with joseph “run” simmons and darryl “dmc” mcdaniel in the early 1980s. together, they helped take hip-hop mainstream with hits like “it’s tricky” and the aerosmith remake collaboration “walk this way.”

jay’s death, following the long unsolved slayings of rappers tupac shakur in las vegas in 1996 and christopher “biggie smalls” wallace in los angeles in 1997, shook the hip-hop world. chuck d of public enemy compared his death to that of john lennon. more than $60,000 in rewards was offered, but witnesses refused to come forward and the case languished.

“this is a case about a murder that for nearly two decades had gone unanswered,” acting u.s. attorney seth ducharme said at a news conference announcing the charges. “today, we begin to answer that question of who killed jason mizell, and why, and we’re confident that we can prove those charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”

washington, who had reportedly been living on a couch at jay’s home in the days before the killing, was publicly named as a possible suspect or witness as far back as 2007. prosecutors allege he waved a handgun and ordered another person at the recording studio to lie on the ground while jordan shot jay in the head oct. 30, 2002.

according to prosecutors, jay would bring in bulk amounts of cocaine to sell retail and was killed as retribution for cutting washington out of a plan to distribute 10 kilograms in maryland.

“they walked in and murdered him in cold blood,” ducharme said.

a message seeking comment was left with a publicist for run-dmc. the group performed anti-drug concerts, established scholarships and held voter registration drives at its live shows. in hollis, the queens neighborhood where he grew up, jay was seen as a role model. friends were puzzled by his death, thinking him an unlikely target for violence.

if convicted, washington and jordan each face a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life in prison, or the death penalty. prosecutors said in court papers that attorney general william barr had not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty.

jordan pleaded not guilty at an arraigned held monday by teleconference because of coronavirus-related precautions. his lawyer declined comment. washington, who is imprisoned in kentucky, will be arraigned later this week, prosecutors said.

prosecutors have asked that both be jailed pending trial.

the 37-year-old jay was shot once in the head with a .40-caliber bullet by a masked assailant at his studio in hollis. police identified at least four people in the studio with jay when he was killed, including the two armed gunmen.

at jay’s funeral, mcdaniels remembered his friend and fellow run-dmc star as “the embodiment of hip-hop.” he was also a husband and a father of three children.

“jam master jay was not a thug,” mcdaniels said. “jam master jay was not a gangster. jam master jay was a unique individual.”

prosecutors, though, now say jay had been bringing cocaine into the new york area since 1996.

at the time, jay’s acquaintance with washington — a repeat offender with convictions dating in 1982 — worried and upset his family.

before ending up on jay’s couch, washington served prison time for grand larceny, assault, criminal use of a firearm, heroin possession and other charges. he was been linked to the 1995 fatal shooting of randy walker, a close associate of the late tupac shakur.

afterward, prosecutors said, washington hopped from motel-to-motel and robbed businesses including supermarkets and a burger king while detectives pursued him in connection with jay’s killing. he remained at large for nearly three months until police on long island nabbed him for robbing a motel.

last month, as prosecutors were preparing to seek a grand jury indictment against him for jay’s death, washington filed a handwritten petition asking to immediately be released to home confinement, arguing his medical history put him at risk for complications from coronavirus. federal prosecutors responded by asking for more time to respond, delaying any decision until after washington was charged.

jordan, just a teenager when jay was killed, was declared a juvenile delinquent after a 1999 robbery arrest and had a firearm case dismissed when the complaining witness refused to cooperate with law enforcement. in recent years, prosecutors said, he’s been caught on audio and video surveillance six times selling cocaine to an undercover federal agent.

"America's suburbs, an election battleground, now more diverse, home to lots of working women",192,ic10hd,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-suburbs/americas-suburbs-an-election-battleground-now-more-diverse-home-to-lots-of-working-women-idUSKCN25E1DQ,23,1597786202.0,,"washington (reuters) - america’s suburbs were key to donald trump winning the presidency in 2016, and he and his 2020 democratic opponent, joe biden, are battling for votes there ahead of the nov. 3 election.

the republican president highlighted his focus with recent comments about ""suburban housewives welcoming his protection and a wall street journal column on sunday that warned of a ""dystopian vision"" of low-income housing.

u.s. suburbs were initially well-defined white enclaves on the edge of cities when they sprang up during the post-world war two baby boom. the families that lived in them were often structured around a single income - the man's - and a single caretaker - the woman.

while it is hard to characterize a country as diverse as the united states, or even to define what a “suburb” is anymore, the neighborhoods within commuting distance to a major u.s. city look very different today.

they have become more dense, more diverse and less centered on nuclear families. about 36% of the u.s. population now lives in a county that is classified as a suburb under a rubric developed by william frey at the brookings institution, up from 33% in 2000.

diversity

suburban counties still tend to be whiter than the rest of the country, while u.s. cities are more diverse.

but the overall racial makeup of the major suburban counties is close to that of the country as a whole, based on frey’s classification.

in the wall street journal column trump co-authored with housing secretary ben carson, they stated that a majority of blacks and hispanics live in suburbs. it did not make clear what counties were included in that tabulation - there is no standard definition.

under frey’s rendering, there are 488 suburban counties associated with the 100 largest metros, and blacks in the cities outnumber those in the suburbs by about 2-to-1. the ratio for hispanics is smaller.

in july, trump said his administration would rescind a barack obama-era rule that required communities receiving federal housing aid to assess racial segregation in housing and offer plans to correct it.

where the kids are

the share of families with children at home is slightly higher in the suburbs than in cities, according to a classification of counties developed by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention.

there is an even bigger gap, however, between households with children in the suburbs and in small towns or rural areas.

economic contribution

the u.s. suburbs’ gdp share has not been growing, at least before the coronavirus hit earlier this year. knowledge industries have flocked to cities. manufacturing needs space. malls and office parks may have seen their best days.

the post-pandemic age may change much about how the united states organizes itself, but the advantage in that shift may accrue to smaller places, not cities or suburbs. since 2000, the gdp share among the suburbs has been stagnant.

poverty rates rose in u.s. suburbs in the 2000s, and climbed 57% in the country’s largest metro areas between 2000 and 2015, brookings calculated.

housewives

the suburbs are no longer a hub of stay-at-home moms, unlike the popular image of such communities in the 1950s. today, many married women work, and fewer adult women are married.

trump's support has eroded in the suburbs because of his administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, in which 170,000 americans have died. recent reuters polling shows that white suburban americans are far more worried about the economy and healthcare than crime."
Senate report describes 2016 Trump campaign eager to take Russian help,164,ic1wap,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/bipartisan-senate-report-describes-2016-trump-campaign-eager-accept-help-n1237002,39,1597789326.0,,"washington — in a thousand-page bipartisan report released tuesday, the senate intelligence committee painted a stark portrait of a trump campaign eager to accept help from a foreign power in 2016, as well as a candidate closely involved in the effort.

the senate report, the most detailed account to date of the trump campaign's embrace of russian election interference, also asserted that the allegations that ukraine interfered in the election — which president donald trump perpetuated — originated with russian intelligence agencies.

the report, which the committee's republican majority approved, said the committee assessed that the president discussed hacked emails with his longtime associate roger stone — even though trump told special counsel robert mueller that he didn't recall having done so.

the report highlighted some never-before-seen evidence about trump and russia, including three allegations of potentially compromising material relating to trump's private trips to russia that were unconnected to the dossier compiled by former british spy christopher steele.

""separate from steele's memos, which the committee did not use for support, the committee became aware of three general sets of allegations"" involving women, the report said, two of which described a tape. no such allegations were confirmed, but the finding lent new credence to at least one claim in the widely discredited steele dossier.

the committee endorsed the view of mueller and the stone prosecution team that the trump campaign eagerly embraced russian help in 2016 and considered the hacked emails its ""october surprise,"" even though campaign officials knew the material had been stolen by russian intelligence.

""while the gru and wikileaks were releasing hacked documents, the trump campaign sought to maximize the impact of those materials to aid trump's electoral prospects,"" the report said. ""to do so, the trump campaign took actions to obtain advance notice about wikileaks releases of clinton emails; took steps to obtain inside information about the content of releases once wikileaks began to publish stolen information; created messaging strategies to promote and share the materials in anticipation of and following their release; and encouraged further theft of information and continued leaks.""

the committee said it also developed evidence that trump campaign chairman paul manafort may have been connected to the russian operation to steal and leak democratic emails. if that had been proven in court, it would have constituted ""collusion,"" by any definition, but no such charge was ever brought. manafort was convicted of fraud and tax charges unrelated to russia.

the committee found that the trump transition team exposed itself to russian influence.

""russia and other countries took advantage of the transition team's inexperience, transparent opposition to obama administration policies, and trump's desire to deepen ties with russia, to pursue unofficial channels through which russia could conduct diplomacy,"" the report said. ""the lack of vetting of foreign interactions by transition officials left the transition open to influence and manipulation by foreign intelligence services, government leaders, and co-opted business executives.""

it added, ""russian officials, intelligence services, and others acting on the kremlin's behalf were capable of exploiting the transition's shortcomings for russia's advantage. based on available information it is possible — and even likely — that they did so.""

senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., said in a statement that the report's ""detailed review of vladimir putin's campaign to elect then-candidate donald trump reveals damning and illuminating facts about the actions taken by president trump, his family, and his most senior campaign advisors, and it goes beyond the work of special counsel robert mueller. it shows how much the trump campaign relied on hacked russian information for its own political gain, while courting multiple connections with moscow's operatives.""

the report portrayed stone as the campaign's go-between with wikileaks, which was receiving the hacked emails from russian intelligence officers. trump, in written responses to the special counsel, said he didn't remember having discussed wikileaks with stone, ""nor do i recall being aware of mr. stone having discussed wikileaks with individuals associated with my campaign.""

the report said, ""despite trump's recollection, the committee assesses that trump did, in fact, speak with stone about wikileaks and with members of his campaign about stone's access to wikileaks on multiple occasions.""

of ukraine, the report said russian-government operatives from late 2016 until at least january 2020 consistently spread ""overlapping false narratives which sought to discredit investigations into russian interference in the 2016 elections and spread false information about the events of 2016.""

the report said manafort associate konstantin kilimnik, a russian intelligence officer, ""almost certainly helped arrange some of the first public messaging that ukraine had interfered in the u.s. election.""

in 2017, the report said, ""other russian-government proxies and personas worked to spread the false narrative that ukraine interfered in the u.s. election.""

the committee ""identified no reliable evidence that the ukrainian government interfered in the 2016 u.s. election.""

in a statement, white house spokesman judd deere said: ""after a special counsel, numerous other committee investigations, and four prior reports from this committee, the senate intelligence report affirms what we have known for years. there was absolutely no collusion between the trump campaign and russia — a fact verified on page 181 of the mueller report. this never-ending, baseless conspiracy theory peddled by radical liberals and their partners in the media demonstrates how incapable they are at accepting the will of the american people and the results of the 2016 election. they should stop wasting tax-payer dollars with partisan witch hunts and actually work to accomplish things for this country.""

in another development on the russia front, a source familiar with the matter told nbc news that former cia director john brennan is expected to be interviewed friday by john durham, the prosecutor who is investigating the origins of the trump-russia investigation."
Stolen Mailboxes? Don’t Fall for Dems’ Latest Conspiracy Theory,0,ic2sln,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/08/18/stolen_mailboxes_dont_fall_for_dems_latest_conspiracy_theory.html,4,1597792238.0,,"democrats and the media are meddling in our elections again. but this is getting absurd.

joe biden peddles fake stories of “tractor trailers picking up mailboxes.” members of congress threaten to throw the postmaster general in jail. soviet-style propaganda posters of mailboxes propagate on social media. prominent democrats share grainy photos tweeted by has-been actresses with crackpot theories of maga-hat wearing postmen out to steal the election.

never mind every major postal service union has endorsed biden, including the american postal workers union and the national association of letter carriers, which together represent 520,000 active and retired usps employees. the apwu recently said 2020 is “shaping up to be a major election for our union,” and view president trump as a “serious threat.”

details. but it can’t be a vast conspiracy theory without hillary clinton’s projection. “nothing stops the mail,” the chardonnay enthusiast tweeted. except when usps partnered with unions to allow mail carriers to take time off to try to get clinton elected, in “systematic violation” of the law.

there was no russia collusion in 2016. there were no julie swetnick “train rapes” in 2018. and there are no disappearing post boxes in 2020. katu, the local abc affiliate in portland, discovered the bombshell reason mailboxes were on that truck: “to replace them because they're old.” whoops.

the truth never stops them whipping up a mob. susan rice, always the reliable spreader of democrat disinformation, is very concerned, despite the fact the obama administration took at least 12,000 post office boxes off the streets. “where have all the collection boxes gone?” the usps inspector general asked in september 2016. democrats were too busy hawking their fake dossier to bother noticing obama and biden were, by today’s democrat standards, “trying to dismantle american democracy.”

louis dejoy is their new gen. michael flynn. just someone to project their hysterical political fantasies onto, no matter the collateral damage. flynn is an american hero, not a russian asset. (neither was carter page, as kevin clinesmith can attest). dejoy is a logistics professional who successfully ran multibillion-dollar supply chains, not a mail hatchet man. he wasn’t appointed by president trump, but was unanimously approved by members of the usps board of governors, including a democrat, after an extensive search. dejoy will be smeared because he’s a republican. never mind megan brennan, the former postmaster general he replaced, is a democrat.

democrats’ politicization of the mundane is troubling. the media is trying to taint routine maintenance, like transferring equipment to meet demand. like everything else, the pandemic has required businesses to adapt, and the post office is no exception. but it’s democrats who contend we must rest our election results on a service that was losing billions every quarter – before the virus hit. both donald trump and barack obama have complained about the post office for years. what’s not routine? sending millions more ballots out when voters never requested them.

democrats don’t need to invent conspiracies to find problems with vote-by-mail. they could read the local papers. or open their eyes. in indiana, hundreds of ballot applications were sent with the democrat box already checked. in fulton county, ga., and washington, d.c., ballots went missing. in clark county, nev., democrats sent out 1,325,934 ballots and “nearly as many were undeliverable as returned: 223,469 and 305,000.” the other 797,465? many ended up piled in apartment buildings and the trash. the “train wreck” in new york, where it took six weeks to get results few have confidence in.

and of course, there is new jersey. republicans received ballots with no republican candidates to choose from. in paterson, ballots were stolen out of mailboxes, people who never received ballots had votes cast in their name, and the dead voted. statewide, roughly 10% of ballots were rejected. what democratic gov. phil murphy calls a “success.” he’s moving forward with mailing over six million ballots in november anyway, and will count them even if they’re returned a week after election day.

the four indicted for fraud in paterson were each charged with “unauthorized possession of ballots,” including approaching voters “and collecting their official mail-in ballots” which were not theirs.

there’s another term for this: ballot harvesting. they wouldn’t have been charged in california, where it’s legal for anyone to possess as many ballots as they want. that’s what speaker nancy pelosi snuck in her legislation masquerading as coronavirus relief and what marc elias and left-wing groups are trying to force through the courts in a dozen battleground states.

the media keeps claiming there’s no evidence of fraud, but immediately hopped on the democrats’ next conspiracy theory wagon about a “war” on the postal service, with no evidence.

the real assault is what democrats are doing to election integrity with a forced transition to vote by mail overnight. it took the state of washington five years to switch to vote by mail. how do they prevent fraud? every voter has to present a photo i.d. to be registered. safeguards democrats fight against.

another fraud: this is all about our health.

contrary to fearmongering, in-person voting in wisconsin did not lead to an outbreak. the centers for disease control found social distancing and personal protective equipment works at polling stations. dr. anthony fauci says there is no reason why americans can’t vote in person in november.

voting by mail doesn’t prevent you from contracting the wuhan coronavirus, either. in wisconsin, there were more cases found in people who voted absentee than in person.

there are many lessons to glean from democrats’ descent into angry, third-rate conspiracy theorists. one thing the mob banging pots and pans outside the postmaster general’s door teaches us: they’re not afraid to cast a ballot in person."
"Paul Manafort was 'a grave counterintelligence threat,' Republican-led Senate panel finds",220,ic4w7z,https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/3390437001,115,1597798781.0,,"kristine phillips and kevin johnson | usa today

washington – paul manafort's role as chairman of the trump campaign, his longstanding ties to people affiliated with russian intelligence services and his willingness to share information with them ""represented a grave counterintelligence threat"" during the 2016 presidential race, according to a new report from the senate intelligence committee.

""the committee found that manafort's presence on the campaign and proximity to trump created opportunities for russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on, the trump campaign,"" according to the nearly 1,000-page report released tuesday.

the wide-ranging, bipartisan report gives a comprehensive account of contacts between russian actors and trump associates, including manafort and donald trump jr., the president's eldest son. it confirms the findings by former special counsel robert mueller's investigation that russia sought to sway the 2016 race in trump's favor and that members of the president's campaign were eager beneficiaries of the effort, although there was no evidence of a conspiracy with the kremlin.

read it yourself: the 966-page report from the senate intelligence committee

manafort was released to home confinement in may because of the risk posed by the spread of the coronavirus in federal prison after being sentenced to more than seven years.

manafort's attorney, kevin downing, didn't respond to a request for comment from usa today, but he told the associated press that information kept under seal at the request of mueller's team ""completely refutes"" the senate panel's findings, which he called ""complete conjecture.""

the heavily redacted report, released just three months before the presidential election, is the final installment from the republican-led committee's three-year probe into russian election meddling.

""we can say, without any hesitation, that the committee found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate donald trump or his campaign colluded with the russian government to meddle in the 2016 election,"" said sen. marco rubio, r-fla., the committee's acting chairman. ""what the committee did find, however, is very troubling. we found irrefutable evidence of russian meddling.""

the trump campaign cast the senate panel's findings as yet more proof that there was no conspiracy with russia. ""the russia collusion hoax is the greatest political scandal in the history of this country,"" tim murtaugh, trump 2020 communications director, said in a statement.

sen. richard burr, r-n.c., the committee's former chair who oversaw much of the investigation, struck a more neutral tone.

""one of the committee’s most important – and overlooked – findings is that much of russia’s activities weren’t related to producing a specific electoral outcome, but attempted to undermine our faith in the democratic process itself. their aim is to sow chaos, discord, and distrust. their efforts are not limited to elections. the threat is ongoing,"" burr said.

democrats, meanwhile, highlighted findings about trump campaign officials' contacts with russian actors.

the committee's vice chairman, sen. mark warner, d-va., said the ""breathtaking level of contacts between trump officials and russian government operatives"" is a ""very real counterintelligence threat to our elections.""

""this is what collusion looks like,"" said rep. adam schiff, d-calif., chair of the house intelligence committee, echoing senate democrats.

kilimnik, 'a russian intelligence officer'

the report delves deeply into manafort's ties with konstantin kilimnik, a longtime business associate with whom manafort worked as part of his lobbying efforts in ukraine.

while mueller's investigators described kilimnik as someone with ties to russian intelligence, the committee called him ""a russian intelligence officer"" with whom manafort ""sought to secretly share"" sensitive internal polling data from the trump campaign. the committee, however, was unable to determine why manafort did so or with whom kilimnik shared the information.

paul manafort sentenced to prison: 'it is hard to overstate the number of lies'

""the committee assesses that kilimnik likely served as a channel to manafort for russian intelligence services, and that those services likely sought to exploit manafort's access to gain insight in to the campaign,"" the panel's report said.

during and after the 2016 campaign, manafort and kilimnik spoke and met multiple times. the two talked about strategies to defeat democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, according to the report, citing a conversation kilimnik had with an associate in which he said manafort had a ""clever plan of screwing clinton."" the two also talked about how trump might win, the report said, noting that manafort expected kilimnik to share the information to people in ukraine and elsewhere.

the report said kilimnik sought to leverage his relationship with manafort and use him to influence the trump administration and the russian government ""to effect a certain political outcome.""

hannah gaber, usa today

the committee also said kilimnik may have been tied to the russian intelligence ""hack and leak"" operations during the 2016 campaign. the committee said it obtained information suggesting that kilimnik may have been the channel for russian intelligence officials to coordinate the hacking operation, although it acknowledged its evidence is limited.

manafort is one of half a dozen former trump aides and associates who were indicted as a result of the mueller investigation. the senate panel's findings on manafort and kilimnik mirrored some of those in mueller's report.

manafort had told mueller's investigators that he did not believe his longtime associate was also working as a russian spy. mueller's team noted that manafort's partner, rick gates, had suspected kilimnik was a ""spy"" and shared that assessment with manafort.

in one of two meetings with kilimnik during his tenure as trump campaign chairman, ""manafort briefed kilimnik on the state of the trump campaign and manafort's plan to win the election,"" the mueller report concluded. ""that briefing encompassed the campaign's messaging and its internal polling data. according to gates, it also included discussion of 'battleground' states, which manafort identified as michigan, wisconsin, pennsylvania, and minnesota.""

shawn thew, epa-efe

early last year, a federal judge found that manafort had lied repeatedly to federal prosecutors about his contacts with kilimnik, ultimately upending a plea agreement manafort had struck with mueller’s team. among the contested exchanges, prosecutors asserted that manafort lied about having provided polling data to kilimnik.

in 2018, manafort and kilimnik were charged together with attempting to obstruct mueller’s investigation by seeking to block the testimony of at least two witnesses.

the case prompted a judge to revoke manafort’s bail and order him to jail to await separate trials on a slew of financial fraud charges in alexandria, virginia, and washington, d.c., where he was ultimately convicted.

senate panel contradicts trump on wikileaks, roger stone

usa today, wochit

the senate panel contradicted trump's statement to mueller's investigators that he did not recall discussing wikileaks with roger stone, his longtime ally who, during the 2016 campaign, publicly acknowledged his back-channel efforts to communicate with the anti-secrecy group about stolen emails that were damaging to clinton and to the democratic national committee.

""despite trump's recollection, the committee assesses that trump did, in fact, speak with stone about wikileaks and with members of his campaign about stone's access on multiple occasions,"" the report said.

stone was convicted of lying to congress about his interactions with the trump campaign and wikileaks. he was set to begin serving his 40-month sentence when trump granted him clemency.

gates testified during stone's trial last year that he overheard then-candidate trump talking to stone on the phone in july 2016, shortly after wikileaks began publishing the dnc emails. ""more information is coming,"" trump told gates after hanging up, according to gates' testimony.

trump tower meeting and donald trump jr.

the senate panel found that two attendees in the june 2016 trump tower meeting with trump jr. – russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya and russian-american lobbyist rinat akhmetshin – have ""significant connections"" to the kremlin and to russian intelligence services.

evan vucci, ap

""the connections the committee uncovered, particularly regarding veselnitskaya, were far more extensive and concerning than what had been publicly known,"" the report said, adding that neither of the two were forthcoming about their russian ties.

the committee echoed mueller's findings that members of the trump campaign, including the president's eldest son, met with the russian actors to receive derogatory information about clinton. mueller, however, did not charge the president's son and others, saying it would be hard to prove that the participants knew the conduct was unlawful.

the report also provides an unflattering look at the fbi, which the committee said gave ""unjustified credence"" on the findings of a former british intelligence officer, or the so-called steele dossier, as it sought court approvals to wiretap former trump campaign aide carter page.

a separate report by the justice department's inspector general found several errors and misstatements in applications to wiretap page, although it concluded that the broader russia investigation was legitimate.

republicans seized on this finding to criticize the fbi's investigation of the trump campaign during the early days of the russia investigation."
"Senate committee made criminal referral of Trump Jr., Bannon, Kushner, two others to federal prosecutors",306,ice94z,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/senate-made-criminal-referral-trump-jr-bannon-kushner-two-others-n1237155,14,1597829225.0,,"washington — the republican and democratic leaders of the senate intelligence committee made criminal referrals of donald trump jr., jared kushner, steve bannon, erik prince and sam clovis to federal prosecutors in 2019, passing along their suspicions that the men may have misled the committee during their testimony, an official familiar with the matter told nbc news.

the official confirmed reports in the los angeles times and the washington post, which reported on the matter last week. a criminal referral to the justice department means congress believes a matter warrants investigation for potential violation of the law.

the committee detailed its concerns in a letter to the u.s. attorney's office in washington, d.c., in june 2019, the official said.

the post reported that the letter was divided into two sections. one named those suspected of making false statements, the post said: bannon; clovis, a co-chair of the trump campaign in 2016; and prince, a private security contractor.

a second section raised concerns about the testimony of other witnesses, including trump jr. and kushner, whose statements were contradicted by trump campaign aide richard gates, although it did not pointedly make a false-statements allegation, the post reported.

the los angeles times reported that the committee questioned whether bannon lied about his interactions and conversations with prince about a meeting in the seychelles between prince and a top russian official. prince told special counsel robert mueller's prosecutors that he briefed bannon on the january 2017 meeting, but bannon said the conversation never happened.

a lawyer for prince told the post that if there was such a referral, it did not appear to have resulted in an investigation. there has been no public indication of any investigation.

lawyers for trump jr., kushner, bannon and clovis have previously denied that their clients misled the committee."
California has first rolling blackouts in 19 years — and everyone faces blame,5,ichwt4,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/08/18/california-has-first-rolling-blackouts-in-19-years-and-everyone-faces-blame-1309757,7,1597844424.0,,"a pedestrian looks at a sign posted on the door of a hardware store during a citywide power outage in san francisco, calif. | justin sullivan/getty images california california has first rolling blackouts in 19 years — and everyone faces blame while california braced for another round of rolling blackouts monday night, the state’s grid operator held off for a second straight night.

sacramento — the exact root of california’s rolling blackouts is still unclear as more power outages loom, and that's allowed everyone to point fingers.

energy experts monday cited a litany of potential causes for the rotating outages that affected hundreds of thousands of california residents friday and saturday nights: ballooning demand, inadequate transmission, an overreliance on renewable energy and natural gas plant challenges during hot weather.

while california braced for another round of rolling blackouts monday night, the state's grid operator held off for a second straight night, citing cooler than expected weather and widespread conservation. it also came as gov. gavin newsom questioned all of the state's electricity players about why the outages occurred and faced blowback from frustrated residents. still, the state says more blackouts affecting millions of residents could occur this week as a historic heat wave endures.

california has endured planned blackouts in recent years as a wildfire prevention measure. but it was the golden state's first round of rolling blackouts related to supply since 2001, when enron and other energy traders manipulated california's market.

earlier monday, the california independent system operator blamed friday's outages on ""high heat and increased electricity demand."" yet some energy experts noted that demand wasn't particularly higher than normal, as is typical for weekends, and caiso had predicted it would have adequate reserves on hand for the 80 percent of california's grid that it manages.

""what's weird about what happened is they were adequate until they weren't,"" said michael wara, director of stanford university's climate and energy program and a member of the state's catastrophic wildfire cost and recovery commission. ""it seems as if certain power plants for some reason were not able to deliver on the commitments to supply reserves and also supply energy.""

because the friday outage started around 6:30 p.m., when solar is ramping down and gas-fired plants are ramping up, gas is the likely immediate culprit, wara said. ""the timing of all this strongly suggests problems with gas plants,"" he said.

california could raise maximum wholesale prices or increase penalties for non-performance as a way to encourage plant maintenance, he said.

caiso ceo steve berberich said monday that a power plant of unspecified fuel and size on friday ""tripped,"" which caused the facility to go offline. while the details weren't revealed, certain types of natural gas power plants can struggle under hot conditions, and gas units are typically the only ones with that much capacity.

business groups, in turn, were quick to pin the blame on renewable energy suppliers; saturday's outage happened after 1,000 megawatts of wind power and a 470-megawatt gas plant briefly went offline.

“hot weather and a cloudy day should not be able to shut down the fifth-largest economy in the world,"" lance hastings, president of the california manufacturers and technology association, said in a statement. ""while we support california’s renewable energy goals, we absolutely need system redundancy that allows us to continue to operate and manufacture products for our residents and the world.""

others were more explicit about their support for gas, including an executive at nrg, an owner of gas plants and other energy resources in states across the country — including 4,000 megawatts of gas and solar in california.

travis kavulla, a former member of caiso's western energy market governing body and nrg's vice president of regulatory affairs, said the ability of gas to consistently provide power around the clock ""proves the point that, at least for now, it's an essential resource.""

also playing the blame game: berberich, who said renewables aren't to blame, but that caiso has been warning for several years that the puc hasn't required utilities to have enough reserves ready for extreme events.

meanwhile, puc spokesperson terrie prosper suggested caiso mismanaged the situation. she said neither investor-owned utilities nor community choice aggregators were at fault. both ""procured the resources that were required to meet the forecasts,"" she said. ""the question we're tackling is why certain resources were not available.""

and former puc president loretta lynch, who served as the agency's president during the 2000-01 electricity crisis, slammed caiso on monday for not being transparent about what ultimately led to the rolling blackouts. she argued that utilities did have enough capacity, including reserves, to meet demand. lynch and kavulla both said not all caiso data is archived, leading observers to screenshot pricing and other webpages for preservation.

caiso is the ultimate decisionmaker on matters of running the grids of investor-owned utilities, as the operator has visibility into their combined infrastructure and how electrons are transported throughout california and across state lines. caiso is one of several independent system operators and regional transmission organizations across the country, which follow reliability standards set by a nonprofit governing body related to reserve margins and other criteria.

""the iso doesn't know how to manage the grid. they can't keep the lights on when there's plenty of power,"" lynch said. she suspected that like during the enron-driven crisis of her day, so-called electricity ""schedulers"" — or middlemen between utilities and generators — don't always submit accurate logs of when and how much electricity will be delivered, which has sometimes resulted in market manipulation. in an extreme example, enron traders in the late 1990s and early 2000s forced plants offline and created artificial supply shortages.

""what about the grid operator doing its job and running a market that doesn't get manipulated, running a grid that doesn't get blacked out because they won't call on the reserves? the question is, why didn't they?"" lynch asked. she said investigations directed by newsom on monday of caiso and the state's energy agencies should be conducted by an entity independent of market players with subpoena power to fully publicize the grid operator's data.

a renewables advocate said the puc should be doing more to promote voluntary conservation programs, which he said have fallen by half over the last five years.

""i don't think we know enough about all the details, but we do know what we have is a shortage of demand response — that is a direct puc responsibility — and a shortage of new procurement, which is on them,"" said v. john white, executive director of the center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies.

the head of a trade group representing all types of generators pointed to multiple factors, including the general issue of solar's intermittency, but also concurrent heat waves across the west that prevented california from importing power.

""there's just less energy in the system to divvy up amongst the different regions,"" said jan smutny-jones, ceo of the independent energy producers association. ""that's not normally a problem, but when it's hot then it is.""

one of the casualties of california's last round of rolling blackouts said newsom needs to prioritize reliability but that he doesn't have to sacrifice the state's clean-energy goals. he could boost energy storage, for example, in addition to keeping gas-fired peaker plants.

""the bottom line is, people don't want lights to go down,"" said former gov. gray davis. ""people also want a carbon-free future. sometimes those two aspirations come into conflict. a smarter approach, in my judgment, is to have the power you need in reserve, even if it's somewhat carbon-based, to keep the lights on.""

newsom launched an inquiry monday and avoided pointing the finger at any one factor in particular, pledging to continue pursuing the state's low-carbon goals while improving reliability.

""we are not backing off on that commitment; quite the contrary,"" he said. ""but in the process of the transition, in the process of shutting down, understandably, the desire and need to shut down polluting gas plants, in a desire to go from the old to the new in that transition, and the need to shut those down, comes the need to have more insurance.""

still, a political strategist who advised davis in his handling of the 2000-01 energy crisis said he should ramp up his rhetoric against the oft-blamed pacific gas & electric, despite the lack of any evidence the utility played a role in the weekend's outages.

pg&e emphasized over the weekend that the shutoffs were at the direction of caiso, and took pains to distinguish them from wildfire-related shutoffs. “these outages are not public safety power shutoffs, which are called during specific high fire threat conditions, and they are not related to any issues with pg&e's equipment or its ability to deliver energy locally,” the company said in a statement.

""i've seen this movie before, and i just think newsom has to continue to talk about how we restructure that delivery system up in the pg&e territory,"" said garry south, who was davis' political adviser. ""one of the ways he buys himself some time on this is by going back to the theme that pg&e is a proven bad player and the state has to seriously consider what we do with that utility and what we do in that service area to protect consumers and, frankly, protect people's lives.""

correction: a previous version of this report misstated concerns about reserve requirements for non-traditional energy providers."

vacaville, calif. (ap) — crews worked in blistering heat wednesday to beat back wildfires that ignited across northern california, sending thousands of people from their homes into smoky air, briefly halting traffic on an interstate and killing a pilot on a firefighting mission.

hundreds of fires were burning across california, including 23 major fires or groups of fires that gov. gavin newsom blamed on “extraordinary weather” and “all of these lightning strikes.” he said the state has recorded nearly 11,000 lightning strikes in 72 hours and knows of 367 fires.

five to seven people were injured in a fire in stanislaus county, southeast of san francisco, sheriff jeff dirkse told the sacramento bee.

one had major burn injuries and all were taken by ambulance for treatment, he said.

someone evacuating on monday had reported that workers at an illegal marijuana farm were still at the ranch but he couldn’t confirm if any were among the patients.

two fires in solano county prompted evacuation orders for 8,000 residents near the russian river. in healdsburg, with a population of about 12,000, people were warned late wednesday to be ready to flee.

ash and smoke filled the air in san francisco, which is surrounded by wildfires to the north, east and south. the lnu lightning complex is made up of several fires in five counties north of san francisco, including in vacaville, a city of about 100,000 people between san francisco and sacramento.

nearby travis air force base ordered non-mission essential personnel to evacuate, officials said.

the fire had consumed nearly 194 square miles (502 square kilometers) wednesday night, an area larger than the size of san jose.

it jumped interstate 80 wednesday afternoon, briefly blocking traffic in both directions.

several thousand people in the small communities of angwin and deer park were ordered evacuated.

police and firefighters warned residents before dawn to evacuate as flames encroached on vacaville. at least 50 structures were destroyed, including some homes, and 50 were damaged.

“the whole sky was red orange and it was coming over the hill there and it was massive. i’ve never seen anything like it and it only took a few minutes to get here,” said karen hansen.

she evacuated her vacaville home late tuesday as flames rushed toward their small farm, packing up her smaller animals but unable to bring along two beloved horses. they returned wednesday to find the house and barn destroyed, but hansen was thrilled to see that her horses survived.

“i’m not upset about the house. i’m just happy that my horses and animals are alive and my daughter,” she said.

in eastern san francisco bay, a cluster of 20 separate lightning-sparked fires called the scu lightning complex was threatening about 1,400 structures in rugged terrain with dense brush. the fires have torched 133 square miles (344 square kilometers).

to the south of san francisco in san mateo and santa cruz counties, about 22,000 people were ordered to evacuate because of a fire in dense wooded parkland, cal fire spokesman jonathan cox said.

at least 20 homes had burned, fire officials said.

about 22 fires are part of the complex and most were in relatively remote, dense brush until strong winds overnight tuesday pushed them into more populated areas, merging some of the fires together.

resources are strapped, he said, given the number of fires.

“we’re in the unfortunate position where firefighters are going to be spending several days out on the fire line,” he said. “it’s grueling, it’s exhausting.”

in central california, a pilot on a water dropping mission in western fresno county crashed his helicopter about an hour from new coalinga municipal airport right after 8:45 a.m. wednesday.

the pilot, whose name has not been released, was working with guardian helicopters, based in fillmore, which had a contract with calfire to provide emergency services as needed, said zoe keliher, an investigator with the national transportation safety board.

robert satz, a pilot and safety manager at the company, said he received word about the crash around 10:30 a.m. he said he had no further details and declined to identify the pilot.

the fresno county sheriff’s search-and-rescue team was summoned shortly after 11 a.m. to recover the body of the pilot, but it has not reached the crash site because it is in the fire zone, said department spokesman tony botti said.

“they’re trying to methodically and safely get them in and hopefully not get exposed to the fire,” he said.

the cluster of wine country fires threaten an area that only last year grappled with another massive blaze that forced 200,000 to flee — a task made more complicated this year because of the pandemic.

“this is an incredibly emotional and stressful time for most of us who’ve endured a number of wildfires over the last few years,” said sonoma county sheriff mark essick.

in solano county’s vacaville, john gardiner, 60, stayed up overnight after receiving a neighbor’s alert of oncoming fire just before midnight. his house and neighbors’ homes were safe, but he worried that could change with crews anticipating hot winds.

“it was incredible — things swirling, winds just whipping through like a howling, ripping sound and then you could hear explosions going off,” he said. “you can taste smoke in your mouth.”

victoria gregorich, 54, said her family loaded the car and left their vacaville home after deputies told them to evacuate around 12:30 a.m. the fire destroyed her greenhouse, but the house was spared. her neighbors were not so lucky.

“it’s devastating,” she said. “i just thank god we have our home.”

elvis castaneda, 28, and his father, silverio, spent the night moving ranching equipment to a safer location, removing vegetation and making firebreaks with their tractor around friends’ properties.

“we couldn’t see the flames, but the sky was pretty orange, and we knew it was coming our way,” elvis castaneda said.

he said he drove home at 3 a.m. and started packing documents, photos, passports and his guns after hearing that his girlfriend’s family, who live 2 miles (3 kilometers) away, were told to evacuate and move all their farm animals to safety. he got the order to leave after dawn wednesday.

south of carmel, nearly 50 miles (80 kilometers) of scenic highway 1 along the coast was closed due to fires.

in southern california, an 8-day-old blaze grew to nearly 50 square miles (106 square kilometers) near lake hughes in northern los angeles county mountains.

chewing through century-old fir, oak and pine, the fire continued to be a threat to 4,570 structures after destroying a dozen. dangerously hot weather and rough terrain challenged firefighters’ efforts to increase containment, currently estimated at 36%.

minsk, belarus (ap) — belarus’ authoritarian leader threatened wednesday to bring criminal charges against opposition leaders and called on his security services to get tougher on demonstrators — a possible harbinger of a renewed crackdown on the peaceful protests challenging the extension of his 26-year rule.

president alexander lukashenko also accused the west of fomenting the unrest as he sought to consolidate his grip on power amid widening demonstrations.

lukashenko spoke as the european union rejected the official results of the aug. 9 vote that kept him in office and expressed solidarity with protesters. the eu said it’s preparing sanctions against belarusian officials responsible for the brutal post-election police actions.

during the first four days of protests, police detained almost 7,000 people and injured hundreds with rubber bullets, stun grenades and clubs. at least three protesters died.

the crackdown stirred broad outrage and helped bolster protesters’ ranks. on sunday, an estimated 200,000 people rallied around the belarusian capital’s main square. the huge crowds forced the authorities to back off, and police refrained from interfering with demonstrations over the last five days.

but faced with a widening strike that engulfed the country’s biggest industrial plants, police moved again tuesday to disperse some protests. officers briefly detained about 50 demonstrators who gathered outside the minsk tractor factory to support its workers, who have been on strike since monday, according to sergei dylevsky, leader of the factory’s strike committee.

“people are on strike demanding lukashenko’s resignation, and authorities respond with batons and riot police,” dylevsky told the associated press. “lukashenko is not changing.”

the interior ministry said police dispersed demonstrators who were hampering factory workers’ passage and detained two of them for taking part in an unsanctioned demonstration.

police also blocked all entrances to the janka kupala national theater in minsk, where the troupe on tuesday gave notice en masse after its director, pavel latushko, was fired for siding with protesters. actors who arrived at the theater wednesday morning were not allowed in.

“it’s unprecedented that in the 21st century law enforcement is deployed to a cultural institution. the situation speaks for itself,” said latushko, a former culture minister and diplomat, who joined the opposition’s coordination council.

after the council’s first meeting wednesday, members said they would focus on launching talks with the government on the transition of power. “we are ready for dialogue,” latushko told the ap.

the council called for a new presidential vote organized by newly formed election commissions and demanded an investigation into the crackdown on protests and compensation for the victims.

“only a new election can solve the crisis,” leading council member maria kolesnikova said.

the opposition body consists of top associates of lukashenko’s main challenger, sviatlana tsikhanouskaya, as well as rights activists and representatives of striking workers. it also includes the nation’s most famous author, svetlana alexievich, who won the 2015 nobel prize in literature.

tsikhanouskaya, who moved to lithuania after the vote, said in a video statement wednesday that the council will spearhead a peaceful transition of power and help prepare a new fair presidential election. she called on eu leaders to support “belarus’ re-awakening.”

full coverage: belarus

european council president charles michel said after chairing an emergency teleconference of the 27-nation bloc leaders that the eu does not recognize the official vote tally and “stands in solidarity with the people of belarus.” he said it will impose sanctions on “a substantial number” of people linked to belarus’ election fraud and violence.

lukashenko, who has been dubbed “europe’s last dictator” in the west, defiantly dismissed the eu criticism and told its leaders to mind their own business. belarus is not an eu member.

“they have plenty of their own problems,” the 65-year-old former state farm director said at a meeting with officials. “and they shouldn’t nod at belarus to distract attention from those problems. those gentlemen have a log in their eyes, but they don’t see it.”

the belarusian leader accused the west of financing the protests and ordered law enforcement agencies to halt the money flows. he also instructed belarus’ state security committee, which still goes under its soviet-era name kgb, to “track down and stop the instigators of the unrest organizers.”

“there must be no more unrest in minsk,” lukashenko said. “the people are tired. they want peace and silence.”

undeterred by his threats, several hundred protesters gathered outside the interior ministry’s headquarters in heavy rain, shouting calls for the minister’s resignation.

“they are trying to scare us,” said 20-year-old demonstrator alexander filistovich. “lukashenko doesn’t know other methods, but we don’t fear.”

the belarusian leader also warned members of the coordination council that they could face criminal responsibility for their attempt to create “parallel power structures.”

turning to the striking blue-collar workers, lukashenko warned that they would face dismissal and told law enforcement agencies to protect factory managers from the opposition pressure.

“if some think that the government has tilted and lost balance, they are mistaken,” he said. “we will not waver.”

lukashenko has repeatedly spoken to russian president vladimir putin since the weekend, claiming that he secured the promise of security support if belarus needs it. the two nations have an agreement that contemplates close political, economic and military ties.

the kremlin has warned the west against interfering in belarus’ affairs, but remained non-committal regarding security help. putin spokesman dmitry peskov said the treaty includes provisions for possible assistance, but noted that “there is no need for that now.”

Trump retweets audio U.S. intelligence officials call part of Russian campaign against Biden,395,ics0fc,https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/trump-retweets-audio-u-s-intel-call-part-of-russian-anti-biden-campaign-1.9085636,31,1597886484.0,,"u.s. president donald trump has retweeted an audio recording that u.s. intelligence officials have described as being part of a russian campaign to denigrate democratic presidential candidate joe biden.

the leaked conversation, purportedly between biden and former ukrainian president petro poroshenko, dates from feb. 18, 2016. the excerpt of it retweeted by trump centers on the ouster of ukraine’s chief prosecutor, who had previously investigated the owner of a ukraine energy company where biden’s son, hunter, once held a board seat.

by amplifying the recording to his more than 85 million twitter followers, trump underscored the ease with which pro-russian narratives can seep into american public discourse ahead of the 2020 election even after being flagged by intelligence officials as the product of a concerted russian effort. russia has also published disinformation under the guise of legitimate news stories, u.s. officials say, reflecting something of a shift in tactics from 2016, when russia relied on a social media campaign to sow discord and orchestrated the release of stolen democratic emails to boost trump’s candidacy.

the white house did not immediately return a message seeking comment on monday. but the biden campaign accused trump of having “habitually attacked the sovereignty of american elections,” including by “attempting to coerce his ukrainian counterpart into spreading conclusively-disproved lies.”

that is a reference to a july 2019 phone call in which trump encouraged his ukraine counterpart, volodymyr zelenskiy, to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations against biden and his son. the call was at the center of the impeachment case against trump that ended with his acquittal by the senate in february.

“donald trump is the most hostile president to american democracy in our history,” biden campaign spokesman andrew bates said in the statement.

andrii derkach, a member of ukraine’s parliament and a 1993 graduate of a russian spy academy who long has aired corruption allegations against biden and his son, released this year what he says are recordings of conversation between poroshenko and biden when biden was vice president during the obama administration. that effort was flagged in a u.s. intelligence assessment earlier this month that warned of russian interference in the upcoming election, and specifically efforts to denigrate biden.

“for example, pro-russia ukrainian parliamentarian andriy derkach is spreading claims about corruption — including through publicizing leaked phone calls — to undermine former vice president biden’s candidacy and the democratic party,” said the statement from william evanina, the u.s. government’s chief counterintelligence official.

in the conversation retweeted sunday night by trump, poroshenko can be heard telling biden that he had accepted the resignation of prosecutor viktor shokin “despite of the fact that we didn’t have any corruption charges, we don’t have any information about him doing something wrong.”

the twitter user whom trump retweeted posted that the leaked conversation revealed that “shokin was not corrupt” and that there was no information to suggest he had done anything wrong, or that he had lost the support of powerful figures in ukraine.

an anti-biden narrative pushed by trump and his supporters alleges that biden, as vice president, pressured ukraine’s government to fire shokin because shokin had led an investigation into burisma, where hunter biden had a paid board seat.

but biden’s position on shokin, who was seen by critics as soft on corruption, reflected the broader position of the u.s. government and was also supported by other western governments and many in ukraine. there is no evidence of wrongdoing by the bidens, and hunter biden has denied using his influence with his father to aid burisma.

a white house summary of the conversation available online does show that biden and poroshenko spoke on feb. 18, 2016. but poroshenko has generally rejected the tapes disclosed by derkach as a fabrication by pro-russian forces in ukraine."

Here's what's been going on since the last meta post. Please provide your feedback in the comments.

###— Updates —

**Growth**

We recorded just over 7,000 new subscriptions in the seven weeks since the [relaunch.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi25c6/meta_rneutralnews_has_relaunched/) This is a good number, because too much growth risks an [eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) scenario.

**Submissions**

The automatic submissions bot was not working for more than a week, and frankly, nobody noticed. This tells us something about the utility of the feature. We're still planning to improve it, but development has paused for the time being. If you're a developer who feels like helping with that, please [let us know.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fneutralnews)

Automatic submissions are ultimately a substitute for users submitting articles, so remember, if you see something interesting, please consider submitting it here.

**Updated sticky and sidebar**

We've updated the text of the sidebar and the sticky comment at the top of all submissions.

**Posting limit lowered**

When the subreddit first relaunched, we implemented a [posting limit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi274b/meta_rneutralnews_list_of_reforms/) of five submissions in seven days to prevent topics from being dominated by the interests of just a few users. Overall participation was low in the beginning, so we raised that limit to seven. Today we reverted back to the original restriction.

**MBFC ratings can change**

In designing our [source restrictions,](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2bdj/meta_source_restrictions_in_rneutralnews/) we didn't consider what to do if a site's rating changed on [Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/) (MBFC). In just the seven weeks since we relaunched, two different sites on our whitelist dropped below the ""Mostly Factual"" threshold. 

The mods have decided that what counts is the site's rating at the time of submission. When we become aware that a rating has changed, we'll take appropriate action on any submissions from that point on and within the last 24 hours. We will not retroactively remove or approve earlier submissions, even if we discover that the rating change happened prior to those submissions.

Because our bot will automatically approve or reject a submission if the site is already on our whitelist or blacklist, we need the users to bring those cases to our attention. If you see a new submission from a source that doesn't rate ""Mostly Factual"" or higher on MBFC, please report it. And if your submission gets rejected even though it rates high enough, please send us modmail. 

Meanwhile, we'll do some research on a technical solution. If you're a developer who would like to help with this, [please let us know.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fneutralnews)

**Top level comments by OP**

As of today, top-level comments by the submitter are prohibited and will be removed automatically. This is the same restriction we've long had in r/NeutralPolitics.

Because submitters set the topic of a post and can choose an article that supports their particular viewpoint, they have a lot of influence when posting a news item. Allowing top-level comments as well was seen as counterproductive to our goals of evenhanded discussion.

**Reports: good and bad**

We encourage reporting of content that violates our rules. When using the report system, please try to be specific. If you're reporting something other than a violation of one of the [four comment rules,](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comments_.28good.2C_bad_.26amp.3B_ugly.29) use the ""Other"" button to tell us the reason. Accurate reporting is a key component of making this sub run smoothly.

However, if you're reporting contributions just because you don't like the content or the particular poster, you're making extra work for the mods and also committing ""report abuse,"" which is [against Reddit's sitewide rules.](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/213099246-What-is-report-abuse-) 

The people who participate in this forum have a wide spectrum of opinions and viewpoints. No matter how many reports we receive, the mods are not going to remove content or [ban someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_ban_procedures) just because other users don't like those opinions. 

If a user is participating within the rules, but you're consistently bothered by their content, we suggest you disengage with or [block](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/214548323-Blocking-unwanted-contact) them.

### — Requests for feedback —

**Paywalls**

We [asked for feedback on paywalled submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2ckj/meta_request_for_user_feedback_on_specific_rules/) when we relaunched, but we'd like to revisit the question.

The current guidelines say: ""Submissions that link to articles behind paywalls will be removed unless the submitter provides an alternative method of viewing the article for discussion purposes."" 

In the new paradigm, with [source restrictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2bdj/meta_source_restrictions_in_rneutralnews/) and [The Factual bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi2ab8/meta_rneutralnews_has_partnered_with_the_factual/) providing alternate sources, should we keep that requirement? Alternately, should we disallow such articles completely? Should we apply the same rule to soft paywalls (that allow a limited number of free articles)?

**Whataboutism**

Some users have complained about others employing [""Whataboutism.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism)

There's no specific rule against whataboutism right now, but we have a couple questions for the users about it:

* Is whataboutism itself off topic, per Rule 3? For example, if someone is criticizing the position of Politician A, is it off topic if another user responds asking, ""What about the position of Politician B, who held the office previously, with regards to the same issue?""
* Is it discourteous, per Rule 1, for a user to point out that another user is employing whataboutism?

**Good faith and bad faith**

Our guidelines ask participants to [assume good faith,](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comments_.28good.2C_bad_.26amp.3B_ugly.29) which means treating other users as if they believe what they're saying and are intending to engage in meaningful dialog. If an exchange gets to a point where you cannot maintain that assumption, it's best to just disengage.

Although we appreciate reports, we cannot do much about comments reported for bad faith, because removing them would require the mods to make judgements about what's going on in a user's head. Instead, we'd like to remind you that about 99% of our readers never post, and some of them may frequent forums where those same bad faith arguments hold water. If they then stumble into r/NeutralNews and see well-sourced counterarguments, it could be highly educational for them. So, your polite rebuttals to questionable claims are for their benefit.

Yet the question remains whether it's fair to ask our users to keep debunking the claims of bad faith participants. The alternative — a rule that disallows sources that don't support the claims — would be somewhat subjective and difficult to apply consistently. This seems to us like a slippery slope, but we'd like to hear your thoughts and suggestions on this issue. 

### — A final note —

Things have been going pretty well since the relaunch and we're making continual improvements. The vast majority of participants are helping to keep this a respectful, fact-based discussion environment. However, there are a few people who seem to view this as a place to promote the conclusions they've already drawn, and see the rules as just an obstacle. 

If you think that might be you, we ask that you please consider the consequences of your participation style on the rest of the community and make the appropriate adjustments. When we post in keeping with the spirit of the subreddit, instead of just following the letter of the law, it becomes a better resource for everyone.

Thank you.

Steve Bannon Arrested In Scheme To Raise Money For Trump's Border Wall,467,idcpll,https://www.npr.org/2020/08/20/904245273/steve-bannon-arrested-in-scheme-to-raise-money-for-trumps-border-wall,44,1597967095.0,,"steve bannon charged with misusing donations for trump's border wall

updated at 4:35 p.m. et

steve bannon, president trump's former political adviser, has pleaded not guilty through his counsel to wire-fraud and money-laundering charges related to an online scheme that federal prosecutors said was responsible for defrauding hundreds of thousands of people.

bannon appeared via video link in the southern district of new york hours after his arrest thursday morning on a yacht off the connecticut coast.

bannon and three other defendants are alleged to have orchestrated a scheme around an online crowdfunding campaign called ""we build the wall,"" which has raised more than $25 million, according to prosecutors. the campaign was advertised as an effort to build portions of the wall along the u.s.-mexico border and support maintenance operations.

""as alleged, the defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction,"" said audrey strauss, the acting u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york.

authorities said bannon was arrested on a 152-foot yacht off westbrook, conn.

also named in the indictment is brian kolfage, founder and president of we build the wall, andrew badolato and timothy shea. kolfage is an air force veteran who lost both of his legs and his right arm while on deployment in iraq in 2004.

according to the indictment, the four men allegedly used sham invoices and accounts to cover their scheme.

""while repeatedly assuring donors that brian kolfage, the founder and public face of we build the wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle,"" strauss said.

bannon — who publicly referred to we build the wall as a ""volunteer organization"" — is alleged to have received more than $1 million from the organization via a nonprofit he controls, and ""at least some of it was used to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in [his] personal expenses,"" according to the indictment.

the four men are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

bannon was a top adviser to the trump campaign in 2016, and following the president's inauguration, he went on to become white house chief strategist.

thursday's indictment adds his name to a list of five other men with key roles or close ties to the 2016 trump campaign who have faced federal charges: paul manafort, the former campaign chairman; rick gates, who was the campaign's deputy chairman; michael flynn, a campaign adviser who went on to become trump's first national security adviser; roger stone, a longtime trump adviser; and michael cohen, his former attorney and fixer.

a justice department official said attorney general william barr was briefed on the bannon case and knew an indictment was coming thursday.

in brief remarks about the case, president trump said he felt ""very badly"" but added that he had not been dealing with bannon ""for a very long period of time."" bannon left the white house in august 2017.

""i don't like that project,"" trump said. ""i thought it was being done for showboating reasons.""

white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany said in a statement that trump had previously disavowed the we build the wall project.

""president trump has always felt the wall must be a government project and that it is far too big and complex to be handled privately,"" she said, adding: ""president trump has not been involved with steve bannon since the campaign and the early part of the administration, and he does not know the people involved with this project.""

"More than 70 former GOP national security officials wrote an open letter backing Biden, calling Trump corrupt and unfit to lead",489,ie0flp,https://www.businessinsider.com/former-gop-national-security-chiefs-back-biden-anti-trump-letter-2020-8,136,1598057503.0,,"more than 70 former republican national security officials have publicly endorsed the democratic presidential nominee, joe biden, saying president donald trump is unfit to lead.

the defending democracy together alliance on thursday published an open letter, which included a 10-point list of grievances.

among the signatories are former cia director michael hayden, the former fbi and cia chief william webster, former director of national intelligence john negroponte, and former defense secretary chuck hagel.

""we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that vice president joe biden be elected as the next president of the united states, and we will vote for him,"" the group wrote.

as the november presidential election looms, trump is increasingly losing the support of republican officials. a growing number of party heavyweights have said they will vote for biden.

visit business insider's homepage for more stories.

more than 70 former republican national security leaders have written an open letter backing the democratic presidential nominee, joe biden, saying president donald trump is unfit to lead.

""we are profoundly concerned about the course of our nation under the leadership of donald trump,"" the letter, published thursday by the conservative advocacy organization defending democracy together, said.

""trump has demonstrated that he lacks the character and competence to lead this nation and has engaged in corrupt behavior that renders him unfit to serve as president.""

among the signatories — who served during the reagan, first and second bush, and trump administrations — are former cia director michael hayden, the former fbi and cia chief william webster, former director of national intelligence john negroponte, and former defense secretary chuck hagel.

""we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that vice president joe biden be elected as the next president of the united states, and we will vote for him,"" the authors wrote.

""we believe joe biden has the character, experience, and temperament to lead this nation. we believe he will restore the dignity of the presidency, bring americans together, reassert america's role as a global leader, and inspire our nation to live up to its ideals.""

in the run-up to the november election, numerous senior republican figures have distanced themselves from trump.

former gov. john kasich of ohio, who ran in the republican primary against trump in 2016, told this week's democratic national convention that he was backing biden.

""in normal times, something like this would probably never happen,"" the lifelong republican said of his appearance at the dnc.

miles taylor, a former trump administration official, also said it was time ""to put country over party.""

colin powell, who served as secretary of state during george w. bush's presidency, said in june he was voting for biden this year because trump ""lies about things.""

numerous republican governors have also held regular late-night conference calls to complain about trump, as business insider's tom porter previously reported.

one of trump's top allies, sen. lindsey graham, has also broken with trump on public-health issues in recent months and praised biden. a campaign ad for the republican voters against trump group last month used older comments from graham calling trump ""a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.""

though there was a ""never trump"" movement in 2016, opposition to trump among republicans has become increasingly vocal and organized during this cycle.

numerous anti-trump groups have sprung up within conservative circles. they include republican voters against trump, the lincoln project, and 43 alumni for biden.

michael gordon, a longtime democratic strategist, wrote in a june op-ed article for business insider that republican officials had been reluctant to speak out until now.

""this year, of course, has brought us new depths in the trump presidency, and the volume of recriminations has begun to increase,"" he wrote."

the may 12 election for paterson's third ward city council was ""rife with mail in vote procedural violations,"" judge ernest caposela said in his ruling, though he left the decision on whether there was voter fraud to the criminal courts.

president donald trump's campaign and republicans have grasped onto the election problems in paterson as they argue against a plan from new jersey's democratic governor to have universal vote-by-mail. they say the fraud in the city race forebodes fraud in november.

paterson's mayor heralded the ruling.

New Research Suggests In-Person Voting May Be Less Risky Than Previously Thought,29,ieb9em,https://www.npr.org/2020/08/21/904739776/new-research-suggests-in-person-voting-may-be-less-risky-than-previously-thought,3,1598095239.0,,"new research suggests in-person voting may be less risky than previously thought

enlarge this image toggle caption kamil krzaczynski /afp via getty images kamil krzaczynski /afp via getty images

amid widespread alarm about the ability of the embattled u.s. postal service to deliver mailed election ballots on time, pandemic-wary voters are now being told that in-person voting this fall may not be as risky as initially thought.

""we've got to vote early, in person if we can,"" former first lady michelle obama declared during a democratic national convention speech on monday. ""we have got to grab our comfortable shoes, put on our masks, pack a brown bag dinner and maybe breakfast, too, because we've got to be willing to stand in line all night if we have to.""

four days earlier, the nation's most prominent expert on infectious diseases had been asked whether people can safely go to polling places and vote in person.

""i think if carefully done, according to the guidelines, there's no reason that i can see why that not be the case,"" dr. anthony fauci said in an interview with national geographic.

""i mean, obviously if you're a person who is compromised physically or otherwise, you don't want to take the chance,"" the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases added. ""there's the situation of mail-in voting that has been done for years in many places. so there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to vote in person or otherwise.""

it's a fraught issue with political implications. president trump and his campaign have fought the massive pandemic-induced expansion of voting by mail around the country, frequently making false claims about mail-in voting.

with the pandemic striking in an election year, officials are now making social distancing, barriers between voters and poll workers, protective gear for poll workers and abundant cleaning products on hand part of the standard operating procedure for in-person voting.

some localities are struggling to find suitable polling place locations and are considering drive-through bank tellers and parking garages as substitutes for high school gyms and community centers. in some cities, professional sports teams are offering up their facilities to provide polling sites with ample social distancing.

still, new research suggests in-person voting may be less risky than many fear.

a peer-reviewed study published in the august issue of the american journal of public health concludes that in-person voting in wisconsin's april 7 election by more than 400,000 electors did not produce a detectable surge there in coronavirus cases.

in that report, researchers from stanford university's graduate school of business and the university of hong kong's school of public health call the wisconsin election ""a large natural experiment"" for better understanding the coronavirus transmission risk.

the team found that hospitalizations in wisconsin for covid-19 cases ""steadily declined throughout april,"" dropping from a high of 101 on april 3 — four days before the election — to a low of 14 on april 18, according to data from the wisconsin department of health services.

there were 71 people, that agency reported in mid-may, who did test positive for the coronavirus who had either been poll workers or voted in person in wisconsin's balloting.

but the study noted that many of those cases involved people who had been exposed to the coronavirus in situations unrelated to voting. even if they had been infected at voting places, the authors said, the number of cases relative to the overall number of in-person voters suggests that such voting involved a ""fatality risk of driving an automobile approximately 140 miles.""

""taken together,"" the study concluded, ""it appears that voting in wisconsin on april 7 was a low-risk activity.""

a may 11 study that was not peer-reviewed, however, reached a different conclusion about the risk wisconsin voters faced on april 7.

""across all models we see a large increase in covid-19 cases in the weeks following the election in counties that had more in-person votes per voting location, all else equal,"" a team of economists from the university of wisconsin-oshkosh and ball state university wrote. ""furthermore, we find a consistent negative relationship between absentee voting and the rate of positive covid- 19 tests.""

the researchers added, ""given these results, it may be prudent, to the extent possible, that policy makers and election clerks take steps to either expand the number of polling locations or encourage absentee voting for future elections held during the covid-19 pandemic.""

and while poll workers in wisconsin wore latex gloves and surgical masks in voting places marked with tape and signs for social distancing, the voters were not required to don masks.

there will be not be any such requirement in wisconsin as well on nov. 3.

""can voters be required to wear ... face coverings at their polling place?"" a voting guide published online by the wisconsin elections commission asks. ""no, face coverings can be strongly encouraged but not required.""

that advice echoes guidelines for voting issued in june by the centers for disease control and prevention in which poll workers were simply told to ""encourage"" voters to use masks."
Trump pressures head of consumer agency to bend on social media crackdown,200,ieje3j,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/21/trump-ftc-chair-social-media-400104,19,1598135304.0,,"earlier this month, simons told senators he didn’t plan to act on the president’s may 28 executive order on social media because he considers it outside the agency’s jurisdiction.

the ftc and simons declined to comment on the chairman’s discussions with the president. the white house didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.

trump, who signed the order after twitter began fact-checking his tweets, also stunned some gop lawmakers this month by withdrawing the renomination of michael o’rielly, a republican on the federal communications commission who had expressed skepticism about trump’s order on free-speech grounds.

both the ftc and fcc are independent agencies that are not subject to the president’s commands — he nominates their commissioners, but he cannot fire them except in cases of “gross negligence.” (trump does, however, have the power to demote simons from the chairmanship). but trump has shown a frequent willingness to push the boundaries of his office’s powers, and his attempted crackdown on silicon valley would be toothless if the two agencies don’t follow through on his desires.

""it's very unusual"" for an ftc chairman to be called to the white house, said william kovacic, a republican who chaired the agency near the end of the george w. bush administration. kovacic, who was unfamiliar with the latest incidents, said he communicated directly with the bush white house only once — via the press office — about a speech by the president that touched on federal hurricane response.

he said policy disagreements have led to a change in an ftc chairmanship only once since 1950, when presidents began designating their picks: in 1981, republican commissioner patricia bailey lost out on her hopes of serving as acting ftc head for president ronald reagan, after she gave a speech critical of office of management and budget director david stockman.

simons' term on the ftc ends in september 2024.

trump’s order urged the ftc to review whether internet companies have deceived their users by censoring political speech and asked that the fcc make judgments about when online companies should qualify for congressionally granted legal immunity over their content decisions. the order also directed the commerce department — which does report to trump — to petition the fcc to take action on the issue, something the department did on july 27.

some leaders at both agencies have been dubious about trump’s requests. at an aug. 5 oversight hearing before the senate commerce committee, simons told senators that the ftc doesn’t have jurisdiction to police political speech.

“our authority focuses on commercial speech, not political content curation,” simons said. “if we see complaints that are not within our jurisdiction, then we don’t do anything.”

in contrast, fellow ftc republican christine wilson said in june that the commission should respond to trump’s order by looking into how social media companies make decisions about user content and targeted advertising.

the fcc’s o’rielly questioned trump’s social media pushback in a july 29 speech, saying: “like it or not, the first amendment’s protections apply to corporate entities.”

five days later, trump withdrew o’rielly’s nomination for a new five-year term at the fcc. o’rielly, who has served on the telecom agency since 2013, must now step down at the end of the year.

without o’rielly’s backing, republican fcc chair ajit pai probably could not advance any proposed changes to online liability protections on the five-member commission, even if he were inclined to. the fcc is seeking public input on the administration’s requests through september, a timeline that would likely push the conclusion to any rulemaking until after the november election.

the white house has offered no public explanation for why it yanked o’rielly’s nomination.

trump’s moves startled some traditional republicans, including senate gop whip john thune (r-s.d.) and other lawmakers who had welcomed o’rielly’s perspective. the commissioner “represents mainstream conservative thought on these issues,” former house republican rep. barbara comstock of virginia told politico, calling his yanked nomination “unfortunate.”

“he's correct that those on the right calling for speech regulation are advocating a new fairness doctrine,” comstock added, citing the long-abolished fcc rules that once forced broadcasters to give balanced coverage to issues of public importance. republicans celebrated that policy’s demise in the 1980s and have long warned against any attempts by democrats to revive it.

trump’s pressure campaign comes as his administration elevates other leaders aligned with his views.

one of his newly ascendant tech advisers is adam candeub, a michigan state university law professor who has represented clients such as a self-proclaimed white nationalist in free-speech lawsuits against twitter and criticized social media companies’ liability protections. he joined the commerce department in april and this month was tapped as the acting chief of the national telecommunications and information administration, a key advisory agency on tech and telecom policy.

historically, any hint of presidential meddling in the decision-making of independent agencies has proven controversial, at times explosively.

in 2014, when then-president barack obama recorded a video message urging his fcc chair to adopt strong net neutrality regulations, republicans accused him of violating the independent agency’s proceedings. in 2015, after the agency adopted such rules, republicans summoned fcc commissioners to capitol hill repeatedly to air their grievances about obama’s intervention.

obama's first ftc chair, jon leibowitz, faced criticism for meeting with white house officials in 2011 on the same days as senior google officials while the company was under investigation by the agency for antitrust violations. leibowitz and the obama white house denied discussing the google investigation, which was ultimately closed in january 2013 without ftc action.

this article is a collaboration between the atlantic and investigatewest. on august 14, 2018, joshua novacheck, a 30-year-old research engineer for the u.s. national renewable energy laboratory, was presenting the most important study of his nascent career. he couldn’t have known it yet, but things were about to go very wrong. at a gathering of experts and policy makers in lawrence, kansas, novacheck was sharing the results of the interconnections seam study, better known as seams. the seams study demonstrated that stronger connections between the u.s. power system’s massive eastern and western power grids would accelerate the growth of wind and solar energy—hugely reducing american reliance on coal, the fuel contributing the most to climate change, and saving consumers billions. it was an elegant solution to a complicated problem. democrats in congress have recently cited nrel’s work to argue for billions in grid upgrades and sweeping policy changes. but a study like seams was politically dangerous territory for a federally funded lab while coal-industry advocates—and climate-change deniers—reign in the white house. the trump administration has a long history of protecting coal companies, and unfortunately for novacheck, a representative was sitting in the audience during the talk: catherine “katie” jereza, then a deputy assistant secretary in the u.s. department of energy office of electricity.

jereza fired off an email to doe headquarters—before novacheck had even finished speaking, according to sources who viewed the email—raising an alarm about seams’ anti-coal findings. that email ignited an internal firestorm. according to interviews with five current and former doe and nrel sources, supported by more than 900 pages of documents and emails obtained by investigatewest through freedom of information act requests and by additional documentation from industry sources, trump officials would ultimately block seams from seeing the light of day. and in doing so, they would set back america’s efforts to slow climate change. a nearly impermeable electrical “seam” divides america’s eastern and western power grids. these giant pools of alternating current on either side of the rockies contain a total of 950 gigawatts of power generation by thousands of power plants. (a third grid serves texas.) but only a little over one gigawatt can cross between them. western-grid power plants in colorado send bulk power more than 1,000 miles away to california, for example, but merely a trickle across the seam to its next-door neighbor nebraska. that separation raises power costs, and makes it hard to share growing surpluses of environmentally friendly wind and solar power. and years of neglect have left the grids—and the few connections between them—overloaded and ill-prepared to transition to highly variable renewable energy. the seams study set out to determine whether uniting america’s big grids would pay. seven aging converter stations presently mediate the meager power flows across the east-west seam. should power companies simply rebuild these electrical “stitches,” or should they upgrade to longer or stronger links? seams’ working hypothesis had been that upgrading might create a more reliable, sustainable, and affordable u.s. power system. the study’s results bore that hypothesis out.



but jereza’s email put the study in trouble: her concern reached the top ranks at nrel and doe, according to an august 22, 2018, email from nrel project leader, aaron bloom, to top researchers and planners at u.s. power companies and grid operators. “there was some significant political blowback at the most senior levels of doe as a result,” bloom wrote. “we hit a political trigger point.” bloom noted that the email had reached dan brouillette, who was second in command to then–secretary of energy rick perry at the time, and has since taken over his position.

the fallout was swift: the lab grounded bloom and novacheck, prohibiting them from presenting the seams results or even discussing the study outside nrel. at the end of 2018, bloom left nrel for the private sector. dale osborn, a retired grid-planning expert and a key adviser to seams, says bloom thought his career was over at nrel. “he told me, ‘i’ll never get a decent project again,’” osborn recalls. and the $1.6 million study itself disappeared. nrel yanked the completed findings from its website and deleted power-flow visualizations from its youtube channel. an nrel document shows that bloom and novacheck expected to submit an article to a top grid-engineering journal within six weeks after the kansas event. that paper remains blocked two years later.



withholding nrel’s grid research is an example of what experts such as arjun krishnaswami, a policy analyst at the natural resources defense council, calls the “deep politicization” of doe and its national labs under donald trump. at a moment when europe, china, and others are racing ahead with advanced long-distance energy-transmission technologies, grid experts say that technology has gone nowhere in the united states—thanks to a failure of leadership in washington. a few weeks before the kansas summit, things were looking good for the seams study. on july 26, 2018, bloom was center stage at a grid symposium in iowa, releasing the study’s findings. in invitations to the event, the transmission enhancements seams described had been billed as a “trillion-dollar economic event.” bloom was on fire, speaking on his feet without notes for nearly two hours. “we’ve been imagining cleaner, bigger modern grids for about 40 years,” bloom expounded, “and now is the time to make it happen.”



bloom showed off his team’s sophisticated methodology using high-resolution video simulations. one simulation showed a hypothetical heat wave in august 2038, causing air conditioners to drive up power demand. as the rising sun swept across the u.s., yellow circles representing solar plants expanded. surplus power from solar plants in the west flooded eastward, limiting the need for pricier and dirtier midwestern coal power. and as the sun set, the midwest’s expansive wind farms began to spin, sending power westward and minimizing use of the west’s coal- and gas-fired generators.

“this is a bold new world that we’re seeing,” bloom told the iowa conference. indeed, the 20- to nearly 35-gigawatt flows he presented—at times exceeding new york state’s peak power consumption on the hottest day of the year—are far beyond what america’s existing grids can handle. but seams presented a path to that future. grid operation was simulated for 2024 to 2038 because the simulated equipment would take several years to build—and would serve for decades. at the request of the study’s technical-review committee, the core seams scenario assumed a “carbon policy” under which power plants would be charged an increasing penalty for the carbon dioxide they released. the industry experts on the committee saw this as a rational way to test the system under higher levels of solar and wind deployment, according to nrel documents and emails.



as expected, the simulations showed that exchanging power across the rockies enables generators on either side to serve a wider area, reducing the number of plants required, and trims operation of the remaining fossil-fueled generators. and they demonstrated that the resulting savings in fuel and equipment more than pay for the added transmission. the benefits were particularly dramatic for the carbon-price scenario. it would eliminate up to 35 megatons of co 2 emissions a year by 2038—equivalent to the current annual carbon emissions from u.s. natural-gas production and distribution. and it would return about $2.50 or more for every $1 invested in transmission.

the design that delivered the largest cost reduction linked up transmission lines to form a new transcontinental network: a “supergrid.” seams simulated a 7,500-mile supergrid that would ship bulk power around the u.s.—a network reaching from washington state to florida. even in the study’s less-ambitious scenario, the supergrid was saving consumers $3.6 billion a year by 2038. but there was a problem: improving the energy grid would reduce america’s reliance on coal. according to nrel’s simulations, coal-fired power plants would shut down en masse over the coming decades, and they would drop even faster with upgraded transmission. that proved to be a very inconvenient finding. on the campaign trail, trump’s promises to revive “clean, beautiful coal” spoke to both the blue-collar and anti-regulatory elements of his political base. after his election, he filled his administration with coal-industry veterans, withdrew from the paris climate-change agreement, and rolled back coal regulations. yet coal plants kept closing. in fact, coal shutdowns have accelerated during the trump administration compared with obama’s. then-secretary perry was under pressure to stem the bleeding in america’s struggling coal industry, and his strategy was to frame coal plants as the grid’s protector against extreme weather, cyberattacks, and other emergencies. things weren’t going well. that january, the federal commission that regulates power and gas markets unanimously shot down perry’s proposal to subsidize coal plants, as well as nuclear generators.

enhanced grid resilience was a likely outcome of the seams expansions. that’s easy to see from high-profile disasters where gaps in transmission led to otherwise avoidable blackouts. during japan’s post-tsunami grid meltdown in 2011, mighty generators around osaka were unable to fill in for the troubled nuclear power plants northeast of tokyo. and experts say power plants across the u.s. could be helping power california avoid heat wave-induced blackouts right now, if the u.s. power system was more interconnected. but perry prioritized securing resilience by protecting coal and nuclear power plants, which store months of fuel on-site. trump officials were already seeking tighter control over all analysis from the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy, which oversees nrel. in may 2018, eere circulated an “enhanced” list of “tier 1” topics requiring political sign-off before researchers could publish their findings, according to documents and emails obtained through a foia request and a lawsuit filed by the center for biological diversity. tier 1 topics included anything related to grid reliability or “projections of entire energy sectors,” such as fossil fuels or renewable energy. nrel emails show that seams was under scrutiny as early as june 2018. novacheck wrote in one email that seams’ results were “extremely sensitive” and that the researchers were “not allowed to show any results without direct doe approval.”

seams escalated into a major political problem after the iowa and kansas presentations. career doe employees had approved those talks but had not alerted eere’s political appointees; expanded disclosure requirements were supposed to exempt conference talks. still, when doe higher-ups had seen the news coverage from iowa, they complained to cathy tripodi, then the acting assistant administrator running eere. insiders say she was livid.



less than three weeks later came jereza’s email alert during the kansas presentation. jereza zeroed in on seams’ use of carbon pricing, according to insiders interviewed by investigatewest. they say the angst over carbon pricing in the seams study was baseless. “it didn’t advocate anything. it just said, ‘if this is the scenario we’re dealing with … then this is what happens,’” one former doe official says. but the political danger arising from kansas was immediately grasped by tom sloan, the state representative who organized the seminar. sloan sought to assuage jereza after novacheck’s presentation. he also emailed novacheck with some advice: “it is not good when one works hard and the results are immediately dismissed because they are not politically correct.” sloan, now retired, says the concern from trump appointees such as jereza went beyond the carbon tax. “the administration was committed to helping the coal industry,” he says. and seams showed that, with or without a carbon price, coal power would be adversely affected by a better grid. “the impact on coal is going to be there if you allow low-cost, renewable power to move,” sloan says.

after jereza threw her red flag, tripodi ordered a clampdown on seams, insiders say. she delegated implementation to alex fitzsimmons, then eere’s 28-year-old chief of staff and chief policy adviser, who had previously worked with fossil-fuel-minded energy think tanks associated with the billionaire oil refiner and gop mega-donor charles koch. three months before he moved to doe, fitzsimmons was quoted as saying that coal-plant shutdowns and anti-pipeline protests threaten lives because fossil fuels keep the heat on during extreme cold snaps. fitzsimmons called martin keller, nrel’s lab director, and seams was swiftly locked down. nrel had a $406 million budget in 2018, mostly through eere. but it was in a precarious situation under the trump team, which had repeatedly proposed cutting more than half of eere’s funding. seams was expendable, because its funding made up less than a quarter of 1 percent of nrel’s budget. “keller is very smart and politically astute and doesn’t want to piss off the administration,” a former doe official speculates. “he’s going to figure out that he can slow that one study down and keep everybody happy.” keller, jereza, tripodi, and fitzsimmons all declined to comment after repeated requests from investigatewest. in an email sent yesterday, a doe spokeswoman reiterated the agency's earlier statements, saying that seams is ""still under review"" at nrel and that it ""will be released upon completion.""

the political footprint on seams can be seen in the final report drafted by bloom and his collaborators. bloom shared version 14 of the paper at the iowa conference, but a week after the kansas talk, the drafts underwent a process of editorial ping-pong between bloom and novacheck, nrel leaders, and doe officials. doe heavily redacted documents it released through foia, but drafts obtained separately by investigatewest show how the edits evolved from august to november 2018. wordsmithing and euphemisms replaced direct references to carbon. the study’s higher-renewables “carbon policy” scenario, for instance, became a “vg,” or variable-generation, scenario—a reference to wind- and solar-power output that shifts with the weather. the “carbon price” became an “emissions price.” other elements simply vanished, such as a statement that co 2 emissions were projected to drop to 30 percent of their 2024 levels by 2038. the phrase “coal plants were retired” similarly disappeared, along with colorful bar charts that had shown how seams’ added transmission shrank coal’s share of power generation to a thin black line. by the time the editorial exchanges ended in early november, the corrections appeared to be stretching the authors’ comfort zone. after the kansas conference, emails show that bloom was instructed not to share drafts beyond nrel. but he ran what would be the final draft by jay caspary, a co-author and the southwest power pool’s research and development director. elements of that final draft concerned the authors, according to a november 7 email from bloom to douglas arent, an nrel lab director: “i reviewed these edits with jay caspary, we can live with this revision, but there are some caveats.” in his same-day response, arent focused instead on further appeasing nrel’s political minders: “here are my suggested refinements to hopefully avoid doe ‘over reactions.’”

over the next year, the administration promoted fitzsimmons to deputy assistant secretary, and tripodi stepped up to head the department’s office of policy. jereza left for the industry-affiliated electric power research institute, where she is now a vice president. the seams study, in contrast, went nowhere. its final report remains unpublished. nearly a year after arent’s november 7 reply—the last substantive discussion of seams in the foia documents—a group of grid experts publicly called out the doe at a transmission conference, saying that seams was completed and that doe had “bottled” it up. doe communications staff insisted that the study was ongoing. a statement issued in september 2019 asserts, “doe career staff reviewed preliminary results and saw an opportunity to strengthen the study by expanding the project to model and analyze additional scenarios.” doe suggested that seams would be released in 2022. an nrel media-relations person responded to investigatewest’s queries to nrel officials, providing a statement “on behalf of the laboratory” that parroted doe’s. nrel’s statement added only that “all information that is currently available” on seams is on the project’s website. the site claims that more than 30 industry organizations “are helping guide” the study via the technical-review committee. caspary, that panel’s co-chair, says it has not met in more than two years.

according to susan tierney, a former assistant secretary of energy who chairs nrel’s external advisory council, national labs have operated with considerable independence in the past: “there was an understanding that the labs have a duty to perform quality research. i was not familiar with situations where there was an editorial thumb on the scale.” but under trump, political appointees have made unprecedented moves to regulate how science is conducted, according to a historical analysis and warning by experts in science and the law in the journal science. and other scientific studies—especially those related to climate change—have been similarly slow-walked or buried. one of them was a doe-commissioned study on grid resiliency, completed in april 2018. michael webber, an energy expert at the university of texas at austin and the study’s leader, notes that his conclusion—that increased transmission, not just fuel-storing generators, helps grids respond to extreme events—conflicted with statements made by doe leaders. “i never got a message from anybody saying ‘please do a study that concludes coal is magical,’ so there was never direct pressure on me for that. but i could sort of read the winds,” webber says. in the case of seams, doe’s interference has had a real and practical impact. caspary says he has been waiting for access to seams’ simulation tools to do follow-up studies for the southwest power pool. there’s a growing backlog of wind and solar projects seeking to use the pool’s lines.

and by labeling the study incomplete and blocking its publication, doe has diminished the credibility of seams’ findings. one power-sector trade journal, noting what it called “a lot of hype” after the iowa meeting, said seams wasn’t even a study: “it actually was a slide deck describing some future real study.” that loss of credibility hinders the chances of jump-starting large-scale power-grid planning in the united states. the power-industry expert peter fox-penner, who runs the boston university institute for sustainable energy, says the u.s. is falling behind other major economies when it comes to creating the big grid links that make a transition to renewable energy possible. as fox-penner writes in his 2020 book, power after carbon: building a clean, resilient grid, “without better integrated planning, we can’t even guess at the amount of transmission we need and where and how it should be built. europe, australia, and other countries are starting to get a good handle on these questions while the united states lags well behind.” the international energy agency has estimated that china’s growing interregional transmission could save its consumers and industries $9 billion a year. meanwhile, the nationwide report on grid congestion that doe is required by law to update every three years—a crucial component of grid planning—is two years behind schedule. (doe’s website still anticipates a 2019 update to the obama administration’s 2015 study.)

and there are more signs of trouble at nrel, where two more grid-modeling studies are now missing in action. tierney says the three studies were planned as a trifecta: seams was the prelude; a north american–wide study adding in texas, mexico, and canada was the main event; and an analysis of electrifying energy demands primarily met by coal, gas, and petroleum would be the closer. the last study's final phase explores how u.s. grids could supply extra power to replace fossil fuels, face the same political sensitivities as seams, and has yet to surface. tierney says nrel told her last year that it was “awaiting sign-off” at doe. nrel’s continental-scale study, meanwhile, is far behind schedule. until early july, the north american renewable integration study’s project website was still promising final results last year. nrel now says results could be out later this year, but a canadian official tells investigatewest that 2020 is unlikely. osborn, the retired power planner, is a member of the study’s technical-review committee and speculates that nrel officials put it on hold in hopes of a more receptive administration come 2021. if nrel researchers are able to work unencumbered by political concerns and release seams in its entirety, it could help point the u.s. toward a greener future, in which a robust economy runs on renewable energy. but for now, seams is demonstrating an unintended finding—that when administrations stick their hands into scientific research, politically inconvenient truths are in peril. support for this story was provided by a grant from the fund for investigative journalism."

tucker carlson, fox news: we’re on day three of the democratic national convention. how’s it going so far? former democratic candidate marianne williamson has been following it closely. she describes the experience as quote, “like binge watching a marriott commercial.” that’s about right. pretty unappetizing. platitudes heaped upon cliches, smothered in a thick sauce of self-righteousness and stupidity. no normal person could eat what the dnc is serving this week. we tune in because it’s our job.



so far, the main excitement has been watching just how shamelessly they can lie. the goal appears to be complete reality-inversion. professional rich lady michelle obama told america that she was oppressed. the criminally negligent governor of new york bragged about how well he handled coronavirus. jefferey epstein’s old pal bill clinton showed up to speak as the party’s moral voice.



there’s a been low-grade thrill in watching all of this. at the very least, you’ve got to tip your hat to their audacity. they don’t tell small lies in the democratic party. they go all the way. you catch them stealing your wallet, and they arrest you for theft. and then give you a lecture about how crime doesn’t pay.



to longtime students of the liberal mind, none of this is new. the left long ago built an entire political party based on the freudian principle of transference: they displace their own sins onto you, thereby cleansing their consciences, and allowing themselves to seize the moral high ground. it’s a clever trick. but at this point, it’s an old trick. we know how it’s done. the public certainly seems to have figured it out. last night, the democrats’ convention lost in the ratings to a variety show called “america’s got talent.” a pair of jugglers from the philippines wearing glow-in-the-dark headbands did a yo-yo demonstration. that out-rated “doctor” jill biden. by a lot.



we could have told you that was going to happen. only nicole wallace wants to watch another speech by doctor jill. and by the way, what kind of physician is she? some of us aren’t feeling well. we never learned the answer to that.



what the democrats should have done is put the rest of the proceedings on tv. that would get an audience. you might not know this, but most of the actual convention events take place during daytime hours. the networks don't cover it. you have no idea it happened. there's a reason for that, of course. but what a loss for the rest of us. if you saw what they were saying during the day, you’d never tune in to prime time again. in fact, you might flee the country. for the last three days, we’ve watched it all. in a moment, we’ll show you what we found.



but first, before we get to that, we wanted to bring you a moment of prayer that broke out at the convention on monday, when a pastor called frederick haynes took the microphone. as you listen, compare it to what you might hear in your own church:



dnc preacher: you had the nerve to build a wall while at the same time you have in the harbor there in new york a statue of liberty saying give me your tired, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. jesus will say 'america, if you don’t get your act together, you may well go to hell.



vote for joe biden, doomed sinners, or you’re going to hell! pretty straightforward message. was jonathan edwards ever clearer than that? was jerry falwell? despite what you may have heard, it’s the democratic party that’s the hotbed of religious extremism these days. pastor go-to-hell haynes, for example, is a fan of minister louis farrakhan. these are men of faith. just not your faith.



but religion isn’t the only institution the democrats are reconfiguring at their convention. the pledge of allegiance could use an overhaul too, they’ve decided, and they’re giving it one. watch the new version:



dnc: i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all ..someday.



“someday.” someday this could be a good country. someday. if we’re in charge. otherwise, it’s awful. without us at the helm, america isn’t worth saving. michelle obama has suggested something like that from time to time: the first time she was proud of the country was when her family got to run it. but that nuanced by today’s standards. at the democratic convention, a transgender-rights activist called linda labeija just came out and said it explicitly:



linda labeija: i’ve never felt american. i don’t know the pledge of allegiance. those are not my systems the way that that is not my president.



donald trump is “not their president.” meaning this is not their country, as long as they disagree with the guy in the white house. it’s all or nothing, and right now, they’re trending toward noticing. which is why they apparently turned over the dnc’s stage directions to colin kaepernick. watch:



dnc member: many of the videos and pictures you're about to see were recorded before covid, which is why the kids are not social distancing. you may rise or kneel, if you are able, per your preference.



if you watch this stuff for long enough, it’s easy to forget that it’s all pretty fringy. most poeple don;t agree with this. most americans like their country. that’s why they live here. a lot of them display that affection by standing for the national anthem. it’s a small thing, but it means quiet a bit to people. americans have died in battle to protect our national symbols. that’s not just a talking point. it really happened. but they don’t know anything about that at the democratic national convention. they don’t think your kids should know about it either. that’s why they’ve endorsed erasing american history:



dnc member: may this moment in history manifest more monuments like these to replace to old ones that no one really cares to see anymore. may their emergence in long overdue establishment and existence remind everyone of our terrible, ugly and hurtful black world history.



so if you’re keeping track at home, it’s: erase american history. rewrite the pledge of allegiance. mock the national anthem. and turn christianity into a political weapon. theyu’ve been busy over there. now it’s time for some granular policy discussions. we’ve already showed you some of the dnc’s platform. they want to get rid of a lot of our prisons, for example. they’d like to do away with bail for criminals. but that’s just a start. for more, we’re going to go now to someone called ""j mai."" you should know that j mai's preferred pronouns are they/them. according to ""their"" biography at wake forest university, j mai is, quote, a ""black-vietnamese, transgender nonbinary/gender transcendent mermaid queen-king currently living out their ever-evolving truths in winston-salem."" got it. ok. now, listen:



j. mai: why can’t folks imagine a world without the cops? why can’t folks imagine a world without prisons. why can't people expand their imaginations to include community care to include an abolitionist future. i'm talking about for real for real abolition, not dnc watered down abolition. we're talking about abolishing the police, we're talking about abolishing ice, and we're talking about abolishing prisons.



“we’re talking about” abolishing the police, ice, and prisons. now you know why this isn’t on tv. democrats and their lackies in the media have been telling us for weeks that none of this is true. democrats don’t really want to leave you defenseless. yes, they’re voting to defund billions from police departments across the country, but that’s not really “defunding.” it’s “re-distributing.” not a big deal. calm down. but now j.mai shows up and let’s an entire animal shelter of cats out of the dnc’s bag, and let’s you know that, yes, all your fears are true. we’re doing exactly what you think we’re doing. the gender-transcendent mermaid queen-kings are here, and it’s a whole new deal. get psyched. and be sure to warn your daughters. no more field hockey scholarships to bowdoin for them. there will be boys on the field. democrats want biological men to compete with women in sports. most parents think that’s nuts, because it is, and terrible for girls, because obviously. but at the democratic national convention, it’s not even questioned. watch transgender person marisa richmond explain:



(video: moderator rips gop for discriminating against trans youth in sports)



""we're gonna have a panel looking at trans youth issues. we've been watching state legislatures, especially here in the south targeting trans youth. trying to deny them access to health care, education and even access to the right to play sports... they've been particularly transphobic in schools.”



ok. so no more field hockey scholarships. that’s bad news, but most people could live with it if they had no. but once again, it’s just the beginning. what if they abolished capitalism too? would your like some bread lines to go with that? how about some humiliation on the side? it’s all on the menu. listen to aspiring economist ashley nicole mccray:



ashley nicole mccray: this future that we all want, that we're all trying to build, really is about the destruction of colonization, white supremacy and capitalism.

warren: join us in fighting for joe biden and kamala harris and in supporting the democrats so that we can all continue our work for indian country.



it’s just too hilarious really. we kept waiting for ralph northam to arrive at the dnc's african-american panel in a hood. maybe that’s tomorrow. people online did love the warren panel by the way. it probably would have out-rated the yo-yo brothers from the philippines if they’d aired it at night. people at home flooded the dnc with suggestions for chief warren. here’s one: if elizabeth warren can speak at a native american event, maybe milli vanilli can host the grammy awards? not a bad idea. but it hurt warren's feelings, so the dnc shut down the chatroom.



it bears repeating that not all of this insanity was confined to the daytime hours. a lot of it continued into primetime. sandy cortez showed up to promise healthcare, college education, and higher wages to illegal aliens. she did it all in a 90 second speech. it was like a socialist mad libs competition. watch:

we should note that, crazy as it all was, none of this was too crazy for joe biden or kamala harris. sandy cortez called for giving government health insurance to foreign nationals. j mai imagined a world without cops and prisons. some lunatic in a clerical collar said republicans are going to hell. harris and biden nodded along. it all seemed normal to them. because it is.

washington (ap) — kellyanne conway, one of president donald trump’s most influential and longest serving advisers, announced sunday that she would be leaving the white house at the end of the month.

conway, trump’s campaign manager during the stretch run of the 2016 race, was the first woman to successfully steer a white house bid, then became a senior counselor to the president. she informed trump of her decision in the oval office.

conway cited a need to spend time with her four children in a resignation letter she posted sunday night. her husband, george, had become an outspoken trump critic and her family a subject of washington’s rumor mill.

“we disagree about plenty but we are united on what matters most: the kids,” she wrote. “for now, and for my beloved children, it will be less drama, more mama.”

she is still slated to speak at the republican national convention this week. her husband, an attorney who renounced trump after the 2016 campaign, had become a member of the lincoln project, an outside group of republicans devoted to defeating trump.

the politically adversarial marriage generated much speculation in the beltway and online. george conway also announced sunday that he was taking a leave of absence from both twitter and the lincoln project.

kellyanne conway worked for years as a republican pollster and operative and originally supported sen. ted cruz in the 2016 republican primary. she moved over to the trump campaign and that august became campaign manager as stephen bannon became campaign chairman; bannon was indicted two days ago for fraud.

conway cited a need to help her children″s remote learning during the coronavirus pandemic as a need to step away from her position. she had remained a trusted voice within the west wing and spearheaded several initiatives, including on combating opioid abuse.

she was also known for her robust defense of the president in media appearances, at times delivering dizzying rebuttals while once extolling the virtues of “alternative facts” to support her case. conway was also an informal adviser to the president’s reelection effort but resisted moving over to the campaign.

her departure comes at an inopportune time for trump, who faces a deficit in the polls as the republican national convention begins on monday. her exit was first reported by the washington post."

"Russian-backed organizations amplifying QAnon conspiracy theories, researchers say",345,ifq1l9,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-qanon-russia/russian-backed-organizations-amplifying-qanon-conspiracy-theories-researchers-say-idUSKBN25K13T,43,1598308183.0,,"san francisco (reuters) - russian government-supported organizations are playing a small but increasing role amplifying conspiracy theories promoted by qanon, raising concerns of interference in the november u.s. election.

file photo: a person wears a t-shirt with the anagram wwg1wga, the qanon slogan, while participating in a ""save the children"" march and rally in new york city, new york, u.s. august 12, 2020. reuters/stephanie keith/file photo

academics who study qanon said there were no signs russia had a hand in the early days of the movement, which launched in 2017 with anonymous web postings amplified by youtube videos.

but as qanon gained adherents and took on new topics - with president donald trump as the constant hero waging a misunderstood battle - social media accounts tied to a key kremlin ally joined in.

in 2019, accounts removed by twitter and suspected of being controlled by russia’s internet research agency sent a high volume of tweets tagged with #qanon and the movement slogan #wwg1wga, short for where we go one, we go all, said melanie smith, head of analysis at social media analysis firm graphika. the ira was indicted by robert mueller in his election interference prosecution.

more recently, russian government-backed media rt.com and sputnik have stepped up coverage of qanon, which began with a false proclamation hillary clinton would be arrested for an undetermined reason and now includes theories about child trafficking by hollywood elites, the novel coronavirus and more.

alethea group disinformation expert cindy otis, a former cia analyst, said rt, sputnik and other kremlin-backed media have been writing more about qanon, using it to fit into their broader narrative of: “the u.s. is falling apart, look how much division there is.”

after twitter banned thousands of qanon accounts last month, rt.com predicted the move would backfire by directing more attention to the cause, adding that “it gave qanon followers the validation they craved.”

last week, it ran a similar article after facebook removed about a third of qanon groups and restricted the other two-thirds.

rt’s story began: “facebook has removed thousands of groups and pages related to the qanon conspiracy after expanding its concept of ‘dangerous individuals’ to include those who merely ‘celebrate violent acts.’ streisand effect, meet slippery slope.”

the streisand effect refers to when singer barbra streisand sued to get photos of her malibu, california, home removed from the internet, only to win them more viewers.

the articles have fallen short of full-throated support, and others have been critical. but they cast qanon as channeling legitimate outrage.

qanon followers have taken note and begun to share more content from the russian outlets, according to graphika.

in a report released late monday, it said the qanon accounts it tracked had posted material from 69 other websites more often than rt stories in 2018.

by earlier this year, rt was the 23rd most commonly shared site in the community. in the month ended aug. 20, it had climbed to no. 12. here

“though russia is only one foreign actor capable of targeting us political audiences through the qanon community, its history of operations appear to be the most ideologically aligned with the overarching qanon theory,” the report said. “russia also appears to have made the most effort to gain credibility within the community thus far.”

qanon was named by the fbi as a potential instigator of domestic terrorism, and followers have been charged with making a terror threat, murder and other crimes.

russia is actively interfering with the campaign season in other ways, the government’s top counter-intelligence official said recently, including by disseminating false stories about joe biden in ukraine. democrats are pressing for the public release of more instances.

researchers at graphika, stanford university and elsewhere stressed that qanon for now remains a largely domestic phenomenon. facebook took down two qanon networks for coordinated artificial behavior, before its new content restrictions, and neither had russian connections.

but tracking qanon has become increasingly tough, graphika’s smith said. qanon backers have moved heavily into other social media groups, helping to organize real-life protests against child trafficking last weekend and getting involved in a pro-police demonstration in portland that degenerated into violence.

“it’s very difficult to understand what a qanon account is, versus a trump supporter’s account versus an anti-vaxxer,”

smith said."
Protests erupt after Wisconsin police shoot Black man,176,ifty7c,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/24/wisconsin-protests-police-shoot-black-man-400894,54,1598320266.0,,"the officers were placed on administrative leave, standard practice in a shooting by police, while the state justice department investigates.

the shooting happened at around 5 p.m. and was captured from across the street on cellphone video that was posted online.

in the footage, blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of his suv to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns pointed and shout at him. as blake opens the door and leans into the suv, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire while blake has his back turned.

seven shots can be heard, though it isn’t clear how many struck blake or how many of the officers fired. during the shooting, a black woman can be seen screaming in the street and jumping up and down.

“while we do not have all of the details yet,"" the governor said in a statement, ""what we know for certain is that he is not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.”

evers indicated he intends to take further action over the shooting.

“i have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action,” the governor said. “in the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.”

pete deates, president of the kenosha police union, called evers' statement “wholly irresponsible.”

“as always, the video currently circulating does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident,” deates said in a statement. “we ask that you withhold from passing judgment until all the facts are known and released.”

online court records indicate kenosha county prosecutors charged blake on july 6 with third-degree sexual assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. an arrest warrant was issued for blake the following day. the records contain no further details and do not list an attorney for blake.

in the unrest that followed sunday night, social media posts showed neighbors gathering in the surrounding streets and shouting at police. some could be heard chanting, “no justice, no peace!” others appeared to throw objects at officers and damage police vehicles.

officers fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.

in a scene that mirrored the widespread protests over the police shootings of george floyd, breonna taylor and other black people, marchers headed to the kenosha county public safety building, which houses the police and sheriff’s departments. authorities mostly blocked off the building, which was closed on monday because of damage, authorities said.

laquisha booker, who is blake’s partner, told nbc’s milwaukee affiliate, wtmj-tv, that her and blake’s three children were in the back seat of the suv when police shot him.

“that man just literally grabbed him by his shirt and looked the other way and was just shooting him. with the kids in the back screaming. screaming,” booker said.

civil rights attorney benjamin crump, who has represented floyd's and taylor's families and said he has been retained by blake’s family, said blake was “simply trying to do the right thing by intervening in a domestic incident.” police did not immediately return messages seeking details on the dispute.

crump called the police officers' actions “irresponsible, reckless and inhumane.”

“we all watched the horrific video of jacob blake being shot in the back several times by kenosha police,"" crump said in a statement. “even worse, his three sons witnessed their father collapse after being riddled with bullets. ... it's a miracle he’s still alive.”

wisconsin’s republican assembly majority leader jim steineke cautioned the public and elected officials against “racing towards judgment,” given how few details were known.

“the frustration & anger that many in our communities are feeling must be met with empathy, but cannot be further fueled by politicians’ statements or actions that can stoke flames of violence,” tweeted steineke, who is white and lives about 140 miles north of kenosha in appleton.

for more than 100 years, kenosha was an auto manufacturing center, but it has now largely transformed into a bedroom community for both milwaukee and chicago.

washington (ap) — u.s. home prices rose at a slightly slower pace in june, but the u.s. housing market continued to show resilience in the face of the coronvavirus pandemic.

the s&p corelogic case-shiller 20-city home price index rose 3.5% in june from a year earlier, down from may’s 3.6% increase and slightly below economists’ expectations.

phoenix led the way with a 9% increase followed by seattle (up 6.5%) and tampa (up 5.9%). but prices rose at all 19 cities measured in june. the 20-city index released tuesday excluded prices from the detroit metropolitan area index because of delays related to pandemic at the recording office in wayne county, which includes detroit.

“the june case-shiller numbers show the housing market continues to withstand the pandemic-driven blows that have caused so many other facets of the economy to suffer,” said economist matthew speakman at the real estate firm zillow.

the continuing spread of covid-19 cases and congress’ failure to approve more financial aid to the economy “could jeopardize the path of the economic recovery,″ speakman wrote in a research report. but those “concerns haven’t materialized in home prices to this point.″

the national association of realtors reported last week that sales of existing u.s. home shot up by a record 24.7% in july, the second straight month of accelerating sales. the back-to-back increases have helped stabilize the home buying market, which all but froze this spring when the viral pandemic struck the united states.

in another good sign for the housing industry, the commerce department reported last week that construction of new u.s. homes surged 22.6% last month as homebuilders bounced back from a lull induced by the coronavirus pandemic."
Savings and Social Security: A Breakdown of Joe Biden’s Retirement System,38,igo5yh,https://www.courthousenews.com/savings-and-social-security-a-breakdown-of-joe-bidens-retirement-system/amp/,3,1598428815.0,,"joe biden and his running mate sen. kamala harris, d-calif., arrive to speak at a news conference in wilmington, del., aug. 12, 2020. (ap photo/carolyn kaster)

boston (cn) — joe biden wants to attack income inequality in a place that few people think about: retirement income. and if he wins, he could dramatically change the way that all americans plan for retirement.

biden believes that the current model of retirement savings — workers contributing part of their paychecks to tax-deferred accounts such as 401(k)s and iras — gives an outsized break to affluent people who would save anyway and who are already in the best position to retire comfortably. he wants to eliminate the tax deferral and come up with a brand-new model that would “equalize benefits” for lower-income families.

biden also wants to tax virtually all inheritances, even for poor people. rather than encouraging family wealth transfers as a form of retirement planning, he wants to increase social security benefits, another tactic that would make everyone’s income in retirement more equal.

this will allow “working- and middle-class americans … to retire with dignity,” biden says on his website.

biden’s 401(k) proposal would work a dramatic change in retirement saving. currently, workers can contribute part of their income to a 401(k) plan and not pay any income tax on that portion. they will have to pay tax when they eventually withdraw the funds, but at that point they will presumably be in a lower tax bracket.

the deferral primarily benefits affluent employees because they have a higher current income tax rate and thus save more in taxes when they put money aside.

“this system provides upper-income families with a much stronger tax break for saving and a limited benefit for middle-class and other workers with lower earnings,” biden said. “the biden plan will equalize benefits across the income scale.”

about two-thirds of current retirement-plan tax benefits go to the wealthiest 20% of families, a biden position paper states.

biden doesn’t spell out exactly how he would fix this, but a likely idea is a brookings institution plan that would replace the tax deduction with a flat-rate refundable credit that would be deposited into savers’ accounts rather than issued as a refund. the result is that everyone would get the exact same tax benefit from adding money to an account.

in terms of encouraging saving, the current system provides a “relatively low bang for the buck” because most households have a low marginal rate and so the benefit of contributing to a 401(k) plan is not very great, said william gale, the author of the brookings proposal.

and for high earners, contributions “are more likely to represent funds that are reshuffled from existing savings to take advantage of the tax benefit rather than a new net addition to saving,” gale said.

if biden’s plan looks likely to be enacted, people in higher tax brackets should immediately put as much money as they can into their 401(k)s to maximize their tax break before it disappears, recommended charles trzcinka, a finance professor at indiana university.

while gale thinks the wealthy would save anyway, trzcinka thinks that’s not necessarily the case. “if you give wealthy people less incentive to save, that could have a very big effect on capital formation,” he said, because rich people’s 401(k)s “have a disproportionate effect on the markets.”

another issue is that employers might stop offering 401(k)s altogether, warned elizabeth bauer, a chicago-area actuary.

although employers always claim that they want to help all their workers save for retirement, many are in fact primarily concerned to please their top managers. if 401(k) don’t offer managers a big tax benefit, many companies might simply scrap them and raise salaries instead or create a different perk.

biden’s website also promises that “almost all workers without a pension or 401(k)-type plan will have access to an ‘automatic 401(k).’” a 401(k) plan is automatic if workers are enrolled and a default contribution is deducted from their paycheck unless they opt out.

according to the census bureau, 79% of americans have access to a 401(k) but only 32% actually contribute to one.

the 79% figure is a bit misleading, though, because 401(k)s are almost exclusively a large-company phenomenon. the reality is that only 14% of employers offer such a plan; the remainder — almost entirely small businesses — find them too complex or expensive.

so biden has promised to “offer tax credits to small businesses to offset much of the costs.” again, the goal is to equalize retirement assets by making big-company options available to everyone.

but it’s not clear that small businesses will want to bother if they can’t offer their top earners a big tax break.

at the state level, at least nine states have been experimenting with automatic 401(k)s for workers whose companies don’t offer one. many of these states have set up their own plan with a state-chosen vendor (or, in some cases, a marketplace of vendors) and employees who don’t have access to a private plan can be automatically enrolled unless they opt out.

in may 2017, biden’s running mate kamala harris co-sponsored legislation that would protect these state-run plans under federal law.

it’s possible that biden might try to federalize this idea, although there would be some disadvantages. one is that it could politicize the choice of a vendor, with the government potentially having an incentive to choose companies with appropriate political leanings or that offer investment choices in line with its own objectives such as heavy purchases of government bonds or “green energy” funds.

also, the existence of a “public option” 401(k) could further encourage employers to scrap their own plans.

although it seems like a good idea to encourage low-wage workers to save for retirement with an automatic program, the truth is that many poor people are in debt, said bauer. it might be better for them to pay off high-interest loans rather than contributing to a retirement account, she said.

another part of biden’s plan is to increase the tax on inheritances. estate taxes should be “raised back to the historical norm,” a recent “unity task force” that included representatives of the biden and bernie sanders campaigns stated.

it’s not clear what is meant by the historical norm since rates and exemption amounts have changed dramatically over the years. currently the top rate is 40% and applies only to inheritances over $11.58 million, which means that only a very tiny fraction of people pay any tax.

as recently as the george w. bush administration, however, the tax captured 55% of any inheritance over $675,000, a number that included not only investment accounts and personal property but also the value of real estate and in many cases life insurance proceeds. such a reversion could cause significant numbers of middle-class people to be subject to the tax.

of more concern to the less affluent is that biden also wants to eliminate the step-up in basis. currently, if someone inherits an asset and sells it, its “starting value” for calculating the capital gains tax is its value as of the date the deceased person died, not its value when the person originally bought it. the original value is “stepped up” to the date-of-death value.

eliminating this rule would significantly increase the capital gains tax on almost all inherited assets. and unlike the estate tax, which only hits people above a fairly high wealth level, the capital gains tax would apply to anyone who inherits anything at all, even people with limited means.

biden has not made clear how this would work. one option is that anyone who receives an inheritance would have to pay tax immediately on any unrealized capital gain. this idea was proposed last year by senator cory booker and is the norm in canada, where there is no estate tax but an inheritance is treated as a sale for capital gains purposes.

the other option is “carryover basis,” where no tax is due right away but an heir who sells an asset later will have to pay tax based on the original purchase price.

biden sees the step-up as a loophole that allows rich people to pass appreciated assets to their children while avoiding a hefty tax.

but eliminating the step-up could create administrative problems because it would be necessary to prove what a deceased person paid for an asset many years earlier. the deceased person might not have kept good records and it would be too late to ask him or her about it.

“most people are not meticulous recordkeepers,” said bauer. “it seems like a nightmare to try to identify the original purchase price from something you’ve inherited.”

trzcinka called eliminating the step-up “crazy” and “a big, big burden on a lot of working-class families.” if family members can’t find financial records from decades earlier, they might have to claim a zero basis and “people are going to get hammered,” he said.

trzcinka called the biden proposal “anti-family” because “you’re punishing people for being willing to save for their kids.”

bauer worries that eliminating the step-up will especially harm lower-income people because they’re less likely to have accountants and financial advisors who keep careful records as a matter of course.

she also said that the proposal unfairly punishes families with assets such as houses or farms that have appreciated over many years simply due to inflation. she suggested taxing only the amount of capital gain in excess of the inflation rate.

on the other side of the scale, biden is promising larger social security payments. he would boost benefits for surviving spouses, certain public employees and people who have been collecting payments for more than 20 years; raise the minimum benefit to 125% of the poverty line; and adopt a more liberal measure for cost-of-living adjustments. he would also reduce the penalty that wage-earners experience when they take time off to care for family members.

trzcinka worries that the social security program is already in danger of running out of funds in another decade or two. but he said biden’s proposals would help poorer people who need it most and in the scheme of things, “having big benefit increases on the low end is not that much money.”

increasing social security is another way in which biden wants to equalize retirement income and offers a buffer against the stock market, which biden likes to minimize as an element of retirement planning.

“there is very little correlation between the health of the stock market and the quality of life for the vast majority of middle-class and working-class and poor folks,” biden said recently. “they’re just almost totally disconnected.”"
Court filings: Medical examiner thought George Floyd had 'fatal level' of fentanyl in system,0,igpjip,https://www.fox9.com/news/court-filings-medical-examiner-thought-george-floyd-had-fatal-level-of-fentanyl-in-system,1,1598434006.0,,"article

new exhibits filed in the case against the four former minneapolis police officers accused of murdering george floyd suggest the hennepin county medical examiner thought george floyd’s fentanyl levels were at a potentially “fatal level”, but his and other medical examiner’s findings showed he died of a combination of factors.

six pieces of evidence were filed in the case tuesday one day after former officer tou thao’s attorneys requested the release of the full autopsy reports from the hennepin county medical examiner, the armed forces medical examiner and the private medical examiners hired by george floyd’s family.

the armed forces medical examiner filed a memorandum agreeing with the hennepin county medical examiner’s final conclusion that floyd's death was a homicide, saying, “his death was caused by the police subdual and restraint in the setting of severe hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and methamphetamine and fentanyl intoxication.”

however, two other memos filed tuesday from the hennepin county attorney’s office about conversations with chief hennepin county medical examiner dr. andrew baker paint a different picture about the nature of floyd’s death.

in one memorandum filed may 26 after a virtual meeting with baker, the attorney’s office said baker concluded, “the autopsy revealed no physical evidence suggesting that mr. floyd died of asphyxiation.” baker told the attorney his investigation was incomplete pending a toxicology report, however.

the other memorandum filed june 1 by the attorney’s office indicated baker said floyd’s level of fentanyl was “pretty high,” and a potentially “fatal level.”

""[dr. andrew baker] said that if mr. floyd had been found dead in his home (or anywhere else) and there were no other contributing factors he would conclude that it was an overdose death,” the june 1 memo said.

among the new documents tuesday was a memorandum outlining the findings from the independent medical examiners hired by the floyd family, who list floyd’s cause of death as “traumatic asphyxia due to the compression of his neck and back during restraint by police,” as was evident on bystander videos of the incident.

the memo admits the findings could be incomplete because they were awaiting microscopic slides, pictures and other evidence from the hennepin county medical examiner’s report."

police say bundy was uncooperative on wednesday and that troopers ""were forced to physically remove him, take him to a stairwell, place him in a wheelchair and then into a patrol vehicle.""

police have barred bundy from entering the idaho capitol building for a year.

ammon bundy, who led an armed standoff against federal agents in oregon in 2016, was arrested at the idaho state capitol for trespassing and other charges after a protest tuesday afternoon.

bundy has been part of disruptive protests since the state's republican-controlled legislature convened for a special session monday to address coronavirus-related bills. at times, far-right demonstrators, some armed and unmasked, pushed past state troopers to enter a legislative chamber. tuesday afternoon, amid more reported chaos, police cleared a hearing room at the order of the state house speaker.

bundy, along with two other protesters, refused to leave. he was placed in handcuffs and taken out of the statehouse and onto a boise street in the same rolling chair in which he was seated, according to lynn hightower of the idaho state police.

bundy was expected to be booked into the ada county jail on charges of trespassing and resisting and obstructing officers, both misdemeanors, she told npr.

social media posts and local television stations showed bizarre footage of bundy being detained while sitting in an office chair in his cowboy hat and blazer.

bundy and other members of the far-right patriot movement have been protesting various coronavirus-related health measures — such as mask mandates — across the northwest since the pandemic began in march. extremist group monitors have said the virus has breathed new life into their cause that had been dying down in some parts of the country.

in idaho, several elected leaders have enthusiastically supported bundy and his followers.

bundy, who now lives in emmett, idaho, near boise, has been no stranger to the headlines — or the courts — in recent years.

in 2016, a jury acquitted him after he staged a 41-day siege over control of federal lands at the malheur national wildlife refuge in eastern oregon. in 2017, a judge in nevada declared a mistrial in a separate case involving an armed standoff near the family's nevada ranch."
"2 dead, 1 injured, in Wisconsin protests over shooting of Jacob Blake",218,igwngr,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wisconsin-braces-more-outrage-protests-wake-jacob-blake-shooting-n1238102,97,1598467773.0,[deleted],"two people were killed and one was injured as shots rang out during protests in kenosha, wisconsin, just before midnight tuesday, according to the city's police department, amid anger over the police shooting of jacob blake, a black man.

wisconsin gov. tony evers said in a statement wednesday that he authorized 500 members of the wisconsin national guard to ""support local law enforcement in kenosha county"" wednesday night.

""a senseless tragedy like this cannot happen again,"" evers said in a statement about the shooting tuesday night. ""i again ask those who choose to exercise their first amendment rights please do so peacefully and safely, as so many did last night. i also ask the individuals who are not there to exercise those rights to please stay home and let local first responders, law enforcement, and members of the wisconsin national guard do their jobs.""

a curfew will begin in kenosha county on wednesday evening at 7 p.m. local time.

kenosha police issued a statement early wednesday morning confirming that two people were dead while another sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries on the third consecutive night of protests. an investigation is underway and the victims' identities have not yet been released, the statement said; no announcement was made of any arrests.

the sound of gunfire was captured shortly before midnight in a video posted by a reporter for nbc affiliate wtmj. it was not clear what preceded the shots, who fired or how many people were involved or injured.

in another video shared on twitter, which has been verified by nbc news, a man can be seen sitting in the middle of a street aiming a gun at people who were running along the road.

one person appeared to attempt to grab the weapon, then a shot was fired and the individual was seen to collapse a few feet from the shooter.

at least one other person appeared to be shot before the shooter got up and started walking down the street.

the video did not make it clear what happened in the moments before it began. nbc news has not confirmed whether the incident is the same shooting described by police.

one independent journalist, cj halliburton, said in a graphic video posted to his facebook page that he witnessed the attack and rendered aid to a man who had been shot in the arm. ""he shot the other guy in the head right there in the road,"" wrote halliburton.

the shooting in kenosha follows a familiar call from an armed militia to “defend a city” during black lives matter-related protests.

the kenosha guard, a self-described ""local militia,"" set up a facebook event, “armed citizens to protect our lives and property"" and on its main facebook page on tuesday, asked, “any patriots willing to take up arms and defend [our] city tonight from the evil thugs? nondoubt they are currently planning on the next part of the city to burn tonight!”

the page listed more than 4,000 “interested” in the event. it was removed by wednesday morning, as was the group's facebook page.

militia and armed anti-government groups have seen a sharp proliferation in the u.s. in the last decade. pledging to protect property, these armed groups, often dressed in military-style camouflage and bulletproof vests, have been visibly present at recent coronavirus reopen rallies and black lives matter protests, often with the seeming blessing of local police. their presence has led to violence at demonstrations in louisville, kentucky, albuquerque, new mexico, and portland, oregon.

the protests were sparked after a video shared on social media showed blake, 29, being shot at close range by police on sunday.

blake was shot seven times by an officer and he is now paralyzed from the waist down, family attorney patrick salvi said tuesday. doctors don't know if the condition is permanent.

blake was ""helping to de-escalate a domestic incident"" when he was shot from behind after he walked away from officers, co-counsel benjamin crump said.

kenosha police have released few details beyond saying that officers were responding to a domestic incident at 5:11 p.m. sunday that resulted in a shooting.

raysean white, 22, who recorded the video, has said he heard police tell blake to ""drop the knife."" white said he did not see blake with a knife, and it is not clear whether he was carrying one.

by early tuesday evening, protesters had once again taken to the streets of kenosha, a city of nearly 100,000 about an hour's drive north of chicago.

demonstrators threw bottles and authorities responded with pepper spray as they faced off outside the kenosha county courthouse. authorities drove armored vehicles through the crowd to disperse people at civic center park near the building.

law enforcement using amplification told protesters they were violating curfew and dispersal orders.

""we're asking you to voluntarily comply,"" a male voice said. ""please don't destroy your community.""

as demonstrators were driven out of the park and into nearby streets there were confrontations with men carrying assault weapons who said they were defending businesses, including a gas station. a few small fires burned nearby.

a protest against police also took place tuesday night in atlanta.

earlier in the day, gov. tony evers declared a state of emergency and committed to doubling the number of national guard troops in the city to 250.

kenosha county executive jim kreuser and kenosha mayor john antaramian said in a statement that more than 100 law enforcement officers from other parts of wisconsin were also expected tuesday night.

a curfew was in effect from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m., and transit service was suspended from 4 p.m. to 8 a.m.

during monday night's protests, which spread to other american cities, including new york, los angeles and san diego, kenosha authorities responded to 37 fires and multiple life-threatening gunshot wounds, according to the fire department. the fires ""nearly leveled several city blocks,"" the fire department said in a statement.

the in-custody death of george floyd in minneapolis in late may was still resonating throughout the nation when blake was gunned down sunday.

floyd's death prompted the firing of four officers the next day, and they have since been charged in the death. in atlanta, the officer who fatally shot rayshard brooks from behind in a wendy's parking lot in june was fired, and the chief of police resigned the next day. two days later the former officer, garrett rolfe, was charged with suspicion of murder.

in wisconsin, local, state and federal authorities are investigating the shooting, and the involved officers have been placed on administrative leave.

""we ask that you give the system time to run its course,"" kenosha police chief daniel miskinis said in a video statement tuesday.

on tuesday blake's mother, julia jackson, appealed for peace.

""if jacob knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased,"" she said."
"The Hatch Act, the law Trump flouted at the 2020 RNC, explained",54,ih1d3o,https://www.vox.com/2020/8/26/21402377/hatch-act-trump-rnc-mike-pompeo-white-house-rose-garden-melania-corruption,34,1598485923.0,,"the united states prohibits most federal employees from engaging in certain political activity — especially if those employees are engaged in fundamentally nonpartisan activity such as diplomacy — in order to prevent abuse of power and corruption. on tuesday night, however, the trump administration flouted these limits by holding part of the republican national convention at the white house and broadcasting a partisan speech by the nation’s top diplomat.

the hatch act of 1939 imposes strict limits on most federal civilian workers who want to engage in political activity, and some cabinet departments augment these statutory limits with additional policies intended to maintain a clear wall of separation between partisan politics and nonpartisan government functions.

these restrictions on government workers exist for two interlocking reasons. as the supreme court explained in united states civil service commission v. national association of letter carriers (1973), “it is in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that federal service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service.” but if civil servants are free to engage in political activities, presidential appointees could reward loyal partisans and punish civil servants who favor the party that does not control the white house.

government workers, according to the court, have a responsibility to “administer the law in accordance with the will of congress, rather than in accordance with their own or the will of a political party.” limiting these workers’ political activity helps ensure that they do not use their office to dole out political favors or apply the laws selectively to benefit one political party.

within the trump white house, however, the hatch act and similar restrictions are reportedly viewed with contempt. according to the new york times’s michael m. grynbaum and annie karni, “some of mr. trump’s aides privately scoff at the hatch act and say they take pride in violating its regulations.”

at least some members of congress, meanwhile, seek investigations into some of the trump administration’s efforts to blur the line between government and politics. rep. joaquin castro (d-tx), for example, sent a letter to the state department informing them that he’s probing secretary of state mike pompeo’s decision to address the republican national committee from jerusalem — a clear violation of state department policy.

realistically, however, lawmakers and other officials hoping to restore the wall of separation between nonpartisan government functions and the republican party have few tools at their disposal. the merit systems protection board (mspb), the federal agency tasked with adjudicating violations of the hatch act, ordinarily has three board members. but all three seats on the mspb are currently vacant.

thus, the best chance to hold the trump administration to account for mingling governance and politics will come in november, when voters could potentially punish the gop for flouting the hatch act by voting republicans out of office.

how does the hatch act limit federal officials?

the hatch act does not absolutely bar federal employees from engaging in any political activity. federal workers may still vote, for example. and most federal employees remain free to express their political opinions and even to participate in many partisan activities when they are not on duty.

notably, the president and the vice president are exempt from the hatch act, although many white house employees who almost certainly helped set up and coordinate first lady melania trump’s rnc speech at the white house are not. (the office of special counsel, an office charged with enforcing the hatch act, released a statement on wednesday saying that federal employees do “not necessarily” violate the hatch act by attending political events at the white house.)

the overwhelming majority of federal civilian workers face strict limits while they are performing their official duties. they may not use their “official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.” they may not solicit campaign contributions. they may not run for partisan office. and they may not engage in political activity while on duty, while wearing a government uniform or insignia, or while in a government-owned vehicle.

additionally, the hatch act forbids nearly all civilian federal workers from encouraging or discouraging political activity from people doing business before their agency.

the hatch act also classifies some government workers who are in especially sensitive jobs as “further restricted” employees. these include law enforcement jobs such as fbi agents, members of the intelligence community, many prosecutors, and government employees tasked with overseeing the electoral process itself.

among other things, “further restricted” employees are forbidden from actively participating in political campaigns altogether.

the reasons for these heightened restrictions should be obvious. law enforcement officers and prosecutors wield the state’s monopoly on violence against individual citizens. intelligence officials and other national security workers are tasked with protecting the nation from foreign threats, regardless of who occupies the white house. election officials could fundamentally corrupt elections if they engage in partisan favoritism.

these are the sorts of jobs that should be immune from partisan influence if at all possible, and so the hatch act erects an especially robust barrier between these officials and partisan politics.

the consequences for violating the hatch act can be quite severe. if the mspb determines that an individual government employee violated the act, that employee can be fired, demoted, or even barred from federal employment for up to five years.

that is, of course, assuming that the mspb is capable of acting. currently, federal officials known as “administrative judges” may adjudicate cases that fall within the mspb’s jurisdiction, but those decisions may be reviewed by the board itself. according to the mspb’s website, if a party to such a dispute seeks such review, “a board decision cannot be issued until a quorum of at least two board members is restored,” potentially leaving these cases in limbo.

the state department has especially strict restrictions on political activity

one of the paradoxes of liberal democracy is that we want a government that is responsive to elections but that also administers existing laws without engaging in political favoritism. political appointees hold the senior-most jobs within the executive branch, and these appointees will unavoidably be torn between their obligation to respect the rule of law and their loyalty to the president who appointed them.

but, just as the hatch act recognizes that certain officials in sensitive roles must be especially cautious about partisanship, the state department has a long tradition of insulating even the highest-ranking diplomats from electoral politics. as susan hennessey and scott r. anderson write in a washington post op-ed criticizing pompeo for speaking at the rnc, “diplomats are supposed to represent all americans to the rest of the world, and limiting their political activities ensures that they are able to serve this role effectively.”

for this reason, the state department’s internal policies are especially strict. according to a 2019 memorandum from the department’s office of the legal adviser, “senate-confirmed presidential appointees may not even attend a political party convention or convention-related event.” (in the memo itself, this sentence is bolded and parts of it are italicized, to reflect its importance.)

pompeo’s decision to speak at the rnc, in other words, directly violates his department’s explicit policy.

the fact that pompeo spoke while he was abroad in jerusalem also flouts the state department’s norms. according to the same memo, state department political appointees who are not senate-confirmed may only attend a “partisan political rally” when they are physically present within the united states.

this is a less restrictive policy than the one that applies to senate-confirmed officials like pompeo. but it’s noteworthy that, by appearing at a partisan event while he was traveling abroad, pompeo didn’t even comply with the less onerous restrictions imposed on many of his subordinates.

trump has long sought to undermine protections for civil servants

the hatch act was the culmination of a long process of civil service reform that began with the pendleton civil service act of 1883. prior to civil service reform, federal workers were often chosen through a “spoils system.” when a republican president was elected, they would fill the government with loyal republicans. then these republicans would be replaced by democrats if a democratic president took office.

by the late 19th century, however, this system was unworkable. even setting aside the obvious potential for corruption, the spoils system turned the president of the united states into a glorified hr manager. as candice millard wrote in destiny of the republic: a tale of madness, medicine, and the murder of a president, the line of job-seekers waiting to meet with president james garfield “began to form before he even sat down to breakfast” on his first full day in the white house in 1881. before long, “it snaked down the front walk, out the gate, and onto pennsylvania avenue.”

just as importantly, civil service protections that insulate government workers from politics and evaluate their job performance based on merit are an essential part of liberal democracy. if these workers can be pressured to act for partisan reasons, then the rule of law could give way to a system where the laws are enforced harshly against the president’s political enemies — and hardly at all against his allies.

and yet, trump has sought to undermine these protections. in 2018, for example, he signed executive orders making it easier to fire federal workers and weakening federal unions.

at the time, trump justified these orders as necessary to root out low performers — and certainly the government does waste some money by continuing to pay salaries to workers who eventually deserve to be fired. but there are also worse things than government waste. strong civil service protections will sometimes make the government less efficient, but they help ward off the kind of corruption that threatens democracy itself.

the trump administration’s conduct at the rnc is another warning that this president does not respect the need to maintain a wall between governance and partisan politics. and if he wins another term, that wall is likely to crumble even more than it already has.

pennsylvania gov. tom wolf is asking state legislators to legalize recreational marijuana, saying the government could use the tax revenue to support small businesses and to fund restorative justice programs.

the governor's call to legalize the sale and use of marijuana is part of a broader plan that wolf says will help pennsylvania's economy, which is suffering from months of shutdowns and slowdowns due to the covid-19 pandemic.

wolf's plan calls for some of the revenue from marijuana sales to be used to fund grants for small businesses. and 50% of that funding, he says, would be reserved for historically disadvantaged businesses.

other revenue would go toward ""restorative justice programs that give priority to repairing the harm done to crime victims and communities as a result of marijuana criminalization.""

marijuana has been legal for medicinal use in pennsylvania since 2016, thanks to legislation wolf signed. the state formally activated its medical marijuana program in 2018.

it's uncertain what kind of reception the democratic governor's plan could meet in the republican-led general assembly. wolf acknowledged that in recent months, democrats' initiatives ""have been stopped at every turn by the republican majority focused on ignoring the public health crisis.""

house majority leader kerry benninghoff, a republican, responded to wolf's proposal by accusing him of being ""disingenuous"" by putting out ""an unaffordable legislative agenda.""

in a statement, benninghoff said wolf wants taxpayers to bail him out of the economic trouble that republicans say was caused not by the pandemic, but by the governor's response to it.

wolf says that in addition to cannabis revenue, the state could pay for his agenda by tapping the more than $1 billion in federal coronavirus relief money it still has in its coffers from the cares act.

other elements of the governor's proposal to address the coronavirus and boost pennsylvania's economy include a $3.00/hour increase in hazard pay for more than 200,000 frontline workers.

and in light of the many bars and restaurants that have struggled to survive the pandemic, his plan would also cancel or eliminate the state's alcohol tax for six months.

pennsylvania republicans have clashed repeatedly with wolf over coronavirus-related restrictions, challenging his authority in a battle that was recently decided by a state supreme court ruling (wolf won that skirmish).

as member station witf reports, republican lawmakers in the house plan to focus on limiting wolf's powers when they reconvene this month.

wolf does not face a reelection vote in november. as a two-term governor, he must leave office after the 2022 election."
17-year-old arrested in killing of 2 people in Kenosha,183,ih481a,https://apnews.com/97a0700564fb52d7f664d8de22066f88,36,1598494804.0,[deleted],"oscar walton speaks to fellow protesters while marching against the police shooting of jacob blake in kenosha, wis., wednesday, aug. 26, 2020.

kenosha, wis. (ap) — a white, 17-year-old police admirer was arrested wednesday after two people were shot to death during a third straight night of protests in kenosha over the police shooting of a black man, jacob blake.

kyle rittenhouse, of antioch, illinois, about 15 miles (24.14 kilometers) from kenosha, was taken into custody in illinois on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide in the attack tuesday that was largely captured on cellphone video. the shooting left a third person wounded.

“i just killed somebody,” the gunman, carrying a semi-automatic rifle, could be heard saying at one point.

in the wake of the killings, wisconsin gov. tony evers authorized the deployment of 500 members of the national guard to kenosha, doubling the number of troops in the city of 100,000 midway between milwaukee and chicago. the governor’s office said he is working with other states to bring in additional national guard members and law officers. authorities also announced a 7 p.m. curfew, though protesters ignored it again wednesday.

protesters marched past the intersection where two people were shot tuesday night, stopping to gather around the spot where one person was shot, and to pray and lay flowers. daijon spann said he decided to join the demonstration because one of those killed the night before was a friend.

“i couldn’t take it any more,” he said. “i couldn’t just sit there and watch my friend die.”

evers, a democrat, issued a statement asking those who wanted to exercise their first amendment rights to “please do so peacefully and safely” and urging others to “please stay home and let local first responders, law enforcement and members of the wisconsin national guard do their jobs.”

“a senseless tragedy like this cannot happen again,” evers said.

as of early thursday, the protests were mostly peaceful, in contrast to the violent clashes that marked earlier nights of protests. there were no groups patrolling with long guns as they had on previous nights, and protesters stayed away from a courthouse that had been the site of standoffs with law enforcement.

in washington, the justice department said it is sending in more than 200 federal agents from the fbi, u.s. marshals service and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives. the white house said up to 2,000 national guard troops would be made available.

the dead were identified only as a 26-year-old silver lake, wisconsin, resident and a 36-year-old from kenosha. the wounded person, a 36-year-old from west allis, wisconsin, was expected to survive, police said.

“we were all chanting ‘black lives matter’ at the gas station and then we heard, boom, boom, and i told my friend, `that’s not fireworks,’” 19-year-old protester devin scott told the chicago tribune. “and then this guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, ‘he shot someone! he shot someone!’ and everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him, and then he started shooting again.”

scott said he cradled a victim in his arms, and a woman started performing cpr, but “i don’t think he made it.”

according to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the gunman walk past them and leave the scene with a rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.

as for how the gunman managed to slip away, sheriff david beth described a chaotic, high-stress scene, with lots of radio traffic and people screaming, chanting and running — conditions he said can cause “tunnel vision” among law officers.

rittenhouse was assigned a public defender in illinois for a hearing friday on his transfer to wisconsin. the public defender’s office had no comment. under wisconsin law, anyone 17 or older is treated as an adult in the criminal justice system.

much of rittenhouse’s facebook page is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to blue lives matter, a movement that supports police. he also can be seen holding an assault rifle.

in a photograph posted by his mother, he is wearing what appears to be a blue law enforcement uniform as well as the kind of brimmed hat that state troopers wear.

the sheriff told the milwaukee journal sentinel that militia members or armed vigilantes had been patrolling kenosha’s streets in recent nights, but he did not know if the gunman was among them. however, video taken before the shooting shows police tossing bottled water from an armored vehicle to what appear to be armed civilians walking the streets. and one of them appears to be the gunman.

“we appreciate you being here,” an officer is heard saying to the group over a loudspeaker.

before the shooting, the conservative website the daily caller conducted a video interview with the suspected gunman in front of a boarded-up business.

“so people are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business,” the young man said. “and part of my job is to also help people. if there is somebody hurt, i’m running into harm’s way. that’s why i have my rifle -- because i can protect myself, obviously. but i also have my med kit.”

wisconsin lt. gov. mandela barnes, who is black, said in an interview with the news program “democracy now!” that the shootings were not surprising and white militias have been ignored for too long.

“how many times across this country do you see armed gunmen, protesting, walking into state capitols, and everybody just thinks it’s ok?” barnes said. “people treat that like it’s some kind of normal activity that people are walking around with assault rifles.”

in wisconsin, it is legal for people 18 and over to openly carry a gun without a license.

witness accounts and video indicate the gunman first shot someone at a car lot just before midnight, then jogged away, fell in the street, and opened fire again as members of the crowd closed in on him.

a witness, julio rosas, 24, said that when the gunman stumbled, “two people jumped onto him and there was a struggle for control of his rifle. at that point during the struggle, he just began to fire multiple rounds, and that dispersed people near him.”

full coverage: racial injustice

“the rifle was being jerked around in all directions while it was being fired,” rosas said.

blake, 29, was shot in the back seven times on sunday as he leaned into his suv, three of his children seated inside. kenosha police have said little about what happened other than that they were responding to a domestic dispute.

on wednesday, three days after the shooting, state authorities identified the officer who shot blake as rusten sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the kenosha police department. sheskey shot blake while holding onto his shirt after officers first unsuccessfully used a taser, the wisconsin justice department said. state agents later recovered a knife from the driver’s side floorboard of the vehicle, the department said.

the man who said he made the widely circulated cellphone video of blake’s shooting has said he heard officers yell, “drop the knife! drop the knife!” before the gunfire erupted. he said he didn’t see a knife in blake’s hands.

state authorities did not say blake threatened anyone with the knife.

on tuesday, ben crump, the lawyer for blake’s family, said it would “take a miracle” for blake to walk again. he called for the officer who opened fire to be arrested and for the others involved to lose their jobs. state officials have announced no charges.

vice president mike pence, speaking on the third night of the republican convention, called for an end to violence in kenosha and “law and order on the streets of this country for every american of every race and creed and color.” but pence made no direct mention of blake or other black americans shot or killed by police this year.

democratic presidential nominee joe biden posted a video saying he had spoken with blake’s parents and other family members.

“what i saw on that video makes me sick,” biden said. “once again, a black man, jacob blake, has been shot by the police in broad daylight, with the whole world watching.”

elsewhere, the minnesota governor activated the national guard on wednesday night to help quell unrest that broke out in downtown minneapolis following what authorities said was misinformation about the suicide death of a black homicide suspect. the unrest comes three months after the death of george floyd under the knee of a minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice.

"CDC was pressured 'from the top down' to change coronavirus testing guidance, official says",207,ih9mqu,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/26/politics/cdc-coronavirus-testing-guidance/index.html,18,1598511964.0,,"(cnn) a sudden change in federal guidelines on coronavirus testing came this week as a result of pressure from the upper ranks of the trump administration, a federal health official close to the process tells cnn, and a key white house coronavirus task force member was not part of the meeting when the new guidelines were discussed.

""it's coming from the top down,"" the official said of the new directive from the centers for disease control and prevention.

white house coronavirus task force member dr. anthony fauci said he was in surgery and not part of the discussion during the august 20 task force meeting when updated guidelines were discussed.

""i was under general anesthesia in the operating room and was not part of any discussion or deliberation regarding the new testing recommendations,"" fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, told cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta.

""i am concerned about the interpretation of these recommendations and worried it will give people the incorrect assumption that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern. in fact it is,"" he said.

the new guidelines raise the bar on who should get tested, advising that some people without symptoms probably don't need it -- even if they've been in close contact with an infected person.

previously, the cdc said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic.

cdc director dr. robert redfield said wednesday that changes to the testing guidelines were made after ""updated recommendations"" from the white house coronavirus task force.

""these updated guidelines, coordinated in conjunction with the white house coronavirus task force, received appropriate attention, consultation and input from task force experts,"" redfield said in a statement released to cnn.

""we are placing an emphasis on testing individuals with symptomatic illness, individuals with a significant exposure, vulnerable populations including nursing homes or long term care facilities, critical infrastructure workers, healthcare workers and first responders, or those individuals who may be asymptomatic when prioritized by medical and public health officials,"" he said.

earlier wednesday, a cdc spokesperson referred all questions to the department of health and human services.

in a statement to cnn, hhs assistant secretary brett giroir said: ""this guidance has been updated to reflect current evidence and best public health practices, and to further emphasize using cdc-approved prevention strategies to protect yourself, your family, and the most vulnerable of all ages.""

hhs has not specified what change in ""current evidence"" may have driven the change. in a call with reporters wednesday afternoon, giroir said the update to the cdc guidelines on testing was deliberated and approved last week.

""this was discussed at the last task force meeting and approved, i think that was thursday of last week,"" giroir told cnn's jeremy diamond on the call. ""we posted this on monday morning.""

giroir said in the call that the updated cdc guidelines were written by multiple authors, adding that he, fauci, dr. deborah birx and dr. stephen hahn, the commissioner of the food and drug administration, worked on the updated guidelines.

giroir said the focus was to do more ""appropriate"" testing, not ""less"" testing, and said, ""it cannot be interpreted that we are inhibiting local public health.""

but the new directive also lines up with a trend in policy and rhetoric from the white house. president donald trump has repeatedly suggested the us should do less testing

dr. carlos del rio, an infectious disease specialist and associate dean of emory university school of medicine, said on cnn newsroom on wednesday that the cdc has not provided evidence to explain the changes.

""i mean, the evidence that i'm aware of as of today is that close to 40% of the cases of the infections are asymptomatic and asymptomatic people transmit the infection,"" del rio said.

""so, not testing -- i mean, if you have been in contact with somebody for a few minutes, that's okay. but if you have been in contact for 50 minutes and that people doesn't have a mask, i think you need to be tested regardless if you have symptoms or not. we know especially young people going into the house and then transmit inside the household. so, the guidelines baffle me and i really don't understand them.""

new york gov. andrew cuomo accused the trump administration of using the cdc as a political tool for the campaign.

""the only plausible rationale is they want fewer people taking tests because, as the president has said, if we don't take tests you won't know that people are covid positive and the number of covid positive people will come down,"" cuomo told reporters wednesday. ""it fosters his failed policy of denial,"" he said of the president.

san diego (kusi) – president trump announced major news in the fights against covid-19, studies of convalescent plasma show promising potential as a treatment.

the treatment relies upon the blood of people who have recovered from the virus, and more than 100,000 people have already signed up for it while more than 70,000 have received the treatment.

the fda has authorized convalescent plasma as an emergency treatment for covid-19.

trauma and emergency physician, dr. kelly victory joined good morning san diego to discuss the promising signs of the treatment and what it means for the country moving forward.

furthermore, dr. victory discussed a new report from swiss policy research that reports the overall mortality rate of covid-19 to be about 0.1% to 0.3%, which is very low. they also found that around 80% of those who test positive, remain symptom free.

dr. victory explained the report “really is a comprehensive report on international data regarding covid-19 from the very beginning of this pandemic.”

continuing, “children are at an extraordinarily low risk of becoming significantly ill from covid-19, almost at a 0% risk unless they have underlying disease procesees. the report confirms children aren’t really great vectors, in other words, they aren’t really the ones who spread this. and it confirms the case numbers are quite faulty because many patients are counted 2, 3, or 4 times if they were tested more than once.”"
Wisconsin investigators say knife found at scene of police shooting of Jacob Blake,143,ihiuif,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-usa-wisconsin-shots/wisconsin-investigators-say-knife-found-at-scene-of-police-shooting-of-jacob-blake-idUSKBN25M0KY,148,1598554220.0,[deleted],"kenosha, wis. (reuters) - investigators of a shooting by a white police officer that left a black man, jacob blake jr., paralyzed and the town of kenosha, wisconsin, torn by civil strife found a knife belonging to blake at the scene of the confrontation, the state attorney general said on wednesday.

the incident sparked three nights of civil unrest that has included a wave of arson, widespread vandalism and a separate shooting that claimed two lives in kenosha, a city of about 100,000 residents on lake michigan, 40 miles (60 km) south of milwaukee.

in the first official details of sunday’s shooting released by the wisconsin justice department, which is probing the incident, attorney general josh kaul said the knife was recovered from the driver-side front floorboard of the car blake was leaning into when he was shot in the back.

kaul also told a news conference that blake, during the course of the investigation, had “admitted that he had a knife in his possession.”

blake’s lawyer responded in a statement that his client posed no threat to police and disputed that he was in possession of a knife.

kaul did not describe the knife or say whether it had anything to do with why the officer, a seven-year veteran of the kenosha police department identified as rusten sheskey, had opened fire on blake.

kaul’s briefing came shortly before the u.s. justice department announced it had opened a federal civil rights inquiry into the shooting, to be conducted by the fbi in cooperation with wisconsin authorities.

in a separate development hours earlier, a teenager was arrested and charged with shooting three people, two of whom died, during tuesday night’s protests in kenosha.

video footage from that incident showed a white gunman, armed with an assault-style rifle, firing at protesters who tried to subdue him, and then calmly walking away from the scene, hands in the air - his rifle hanging in front of him - as several police vehicles drive by without stopping him.

wisconsin lieutenant governor mandela barnes said on msnbc the suspect, later identified as kyle rittenhouse, 17, of antioch, illinois, was apparently a militia group member who “decided to be a vigilante and take the law into his own hands and mow down innocent protesters.”

bracing for a fourth night of possible upheavals on wednesday, governor tony evers said he was doubling the national guard force he had ordered deployed to 500 troops, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed an hour earlier.

about 200 protesters defied the curfew for hours after dark as they marched peacefully through city streets, chanting, “black lives matter” and “no justice, no peace,” while law enforcement kept a low profile. no counter-demonstrators or armed militia figures were present.

national guard soldiers were seen taking a dinner break behind the county courthouse, surrounded by barricades and heavy fencing erected around several downtown public buildings the previous day.

preamble to shooting

by kaul’s account of events leading to the blake shooting, city police confronted blake when they were called to the home of a woman who reported that her boyfriend was present “and was not supposed to be on the premises.”

the location he gave for the residence corresponds with the address of the woman identified in media reports as blake’s fiance, laquisha booker.

during the incident, kaul said, police tried to arrest blake, using a taser stun gun in a failed attempt to subdue him.

blake, according to the attorney general, then walked around his vehicle, opened the driver-side door and leaned forward, as officer sheskey, clutching blake’s shirt, fired his weapon seven times at blake’s back.

kaul said no other police officers fired their weapons. the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave.

bystanders captured the encounter in video footage that has since gone viral, unleashing public outrage at the latest in a long series of instances in which police have been accused of using indiscriminate lethal force against african americans.

kaul said police in kenosha are not equipped with body cameras.

a lawyer for blake’s family, civil rights attorney ben crump, issued a statement late wednesday saying blake “did nothing to provoke police” and was “only intending to get his children out of a volatile situation” at the time.

“witnesses confirm that he was not in possession of a knife and didn’t threaten officers in any way,” he added.

three of blake’s young sons - aged 3, 5 and 8 - were in the vehicle at the time and witnessed their father being gunned down, crump said. blake has a total of six children.

neither crump nor law enforcement officials have mentioned court records showing that an arrest warrant was filed against blake in july by kenosha’s district attorney for three domestic abuse-related charges - criminal trespass, disorderly conduct and third-degree sexual assault, a felony.

crump has declined to respond to reuters queries about those records, which list blake’s address as the same street number where booker is reported to reside.

according to crump, blake was struck by four of the seven gunshot rounds fired at him on sunday. bullets shattered some of his vertebrae, leaving blake paralyzed from the waist down, possibly permanently, his lawyers said. he also suffered wounds to his stomach, intestines, kidney and liver and will require multiple operations to recover, they said.

kaul said his department’s division of criminal investigations plans to issue a full report on the incident to prosecutors in 30 days, and that no other details were immediately available.

blake’s family and protesters have demanded the officers involved in the shooting be immediately fired and prosecuted."
Kenosha police chief says deadly shooting wouldn't have happened if people weren't out after curfew,307,ihnvuu,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/27/us/kenosha-shooting-police-chief-curfew-blame-trnd/index.html,164,1598573433.0,,"(cnn) the chief of police in kenosha, wisconsin, where two people were shot and killed on a night of protests after jacob blake's shooting, appeared to shift the blame for the shooting to those who broke the city's curfew.

during a wednesday news conference, kenosha police chief daniel miskinis said the shooting may not have happened if demonstrators and the accused gunman had obeyed the city's newly imposed 8 p.m. curfew

""everybody involved was out after the curfew,"" miskinis said. ""i'm not gonna make a great deal of it but the point is -- the curfew's in place to protect. had persons not been out involved in violation of that, perhaps the situation that unfolded would not have happened.""

Tracking the Suspect in the Fatal Kenosha Shootings,29,ihsoih,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/us/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-video.html,21,1598588293.0,,"a teenager who walked among protesters in kenosha, wis., carrying a military-style semi-automatic rifle was arrested and faces a charge of first-degree intentional homicide in connection with shootings that left two people dead on tuesday night.

kyle rittenhouse, a 17-year-old illinois resident, appeared on multiple videos taken throughout the night by protesters and bystanders who chronicled the events as peaceful protests gave way to chaos, with demonstrators, armed civilians and others facing off against one another and the police in the darkened streets.

the new york times’s visual investigations unit analyzed hours of footage to track mr. rittenhouse’s movements in the moments leading up to, and during, the shootings.

who is kyle rittenhouse?

mr. rittenhouse was arrested early wednesday in his hometown, antioch, ill., which is about 30 minutes southwest of the protests in kenosha, just over the state line.

multiple posts on his social media accounts proclaim support for pro-police causes like the blue lives matter movement and humanize the badge, a nonprofit that he ran a facebook fund-raiser for on his 16th birthday.

his posts also suggest a strong affinity for guns, with videos showing mr. rittenhouse taking backyard target practice, posing with guns and assembling a weapon.

but many details about both his background and his motivations for walking around the kenosha protests carrying a military-style semi-automatic rifle are still emerging.

before the shootings

about two hours before the first shooting, the producer of a video livestream interviews mr. rittenhouse at a kenosha vehicle dealership.

mr. rittenhouse is there at the same time as several other armed men. some of them are positioned on the building’s roof overlooking the parking lot where vehicles were burned the day before.

in a brief exchange on the livestream, he identifies himself as “kyle.”"

They tried to get Trump to care about right-wing terrorism. He ignored them.,0,ii9z1s,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/26/trump-domestic-extemism-homeland-security-401926,9,1598659955.0,,"“i thought, ‘oh my gosh — it’s happening now,’” neumann recalled in an interview.

for neumann, her nightmare scenario of globalized white supremacist terrorism was coming to life. meanwhile, the u.s. government was doing far too little about its own homegrown extremists — often ""lone wolves"" radicalized online by white supremacist websites and fueled by hostility toward immigrants and minorities. but white house officials didn’t want to talk about the rising domestic extremist threat or even use the phrase “domestic terrorism.” the administration’s relentless, single-minded focus on immigration enforcement — coupled with nonstop turnover on the national security council — constantly pulled senior dhs leadership away from everything else. and her ultimate boss, president donald trump, was part of the problem.

this story is based on background and on-record interviews with current and former law enforcement officials, inside and outside dhs. it includes, for the first time, detailed comments from two top former political appointees in the department who tried to tackle the problem before giving up on the trump administration. frustrated by the president’s failure to act, they are actively supporting his opponent.

“at least in this administration,” neumann said, “there’s not going to be anything substantive done on domestic terrorism.”

‘people were excited’

the department of homeland security is one of the federal government’s biggest, newest and unhappiest departments. it was created amid the ashes of the sept. 11 terror attacks as part of the government’s efforts to — as its name suggests — secure the u.s. homeland. it became something of the island of lost agencies, holding everything from the secret service to immigration and customs enforcement to the coast guard under its massive umbrella. only the pentagon and the department of veterans affairs have more employees. and the 230,000 employees at dhs consistently report miserable morale.

in the agency’s misery, donald trump saw opportunity. during the 2016 campaign, he touted the support of unions representing immigration and customs enforcement officers and border patrol agents. and after his inauguration, dhs was one of his first stops. he gave a major speech at its sprawling headquarters in northwest d.c. just five days into his administration, highlighting his focus on the department’s immigration and border security missions.

“it was hot as hell in the gym because there were so many people,” a former dhs official recalled. “people were excited. there was a moment of, dhs isn’t going to be the last on the list.”

but being at the top of trump’s list also brought immense challenges for dhs leaders: namely, trying to amp up immigration enforcement enough to keep the white house happy while also managing the department’s panoply of other missions.

just a few weeks into the new administration, dhs leaders noticed an alarming trend: a burst of vandalism at jewish cemeteries in philadelphia; rochester, n.y.; and university city, mo.

“we were all scratching our heads saying, ‘what is this?’” neumann said. “you could sense that something about the threat was changing and morphing, but we couldn’t quite put our fingers on it until charlottesville.”

on aug. 11, 2017, scores of young white men carrying tiki torches marched through the campus of the university of virginia chanting “jews will not replace us” and “white lives matter,” in a public display of white supremacist mobilization that shocked and sickened the country. the next day, counterprotesters thronged the streets of charlottesville to push back. and a white supremacist drove a car through that crowd, injuring 19 people and killing a woman named heather heyer.

trump’s infamous response to the weekend: “you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.”

it could have been a moment of action from the federal government, neumann said — a chance for a systematic white house review of the threat’s scope and causes. but it wasn’t.

“sadly, the president botched his response, and it became much more about what the president said and how he botched it than it was about what just happened,” neumann lamented. “this is not the america we know. we all had this collective, ‘what in the world? how is this happening in 2017?’”

john kelly, a gruff four-star general, was leading the department at the time. three months later, and just six months into his presidency, trump fired reince priebus as chief of staff and replaced him with kelly. elaine duke, then the department’s second-in-command, stepped in as acting dhs chief for a few months, and then the senate confirmed kirstjen nielsen. as the senior leadership merry-go-round played out, the president’s demands for more deportations and fewer illegal border crossings stayed as high as ever.

trump often expressed irritation when he saw the dhs secretary anywhere other than the border. miles taylor, who was nielsen’s chief of staff, told politico trump used to lambaste her if she didn’t physically spend enough of her time there.

“verbatim the president said, ‘get your ass to the border, why are you not down there?’” taylor said.

another former dhs official, who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s comments, said trump once fumed when he learned nielsen was in europe working on cybersecurity issues — even though cybersecurity is one of dhs’s many core missions.

“why isn’t she on the border?” the official recalled trump saying.

senior dhs officials said they dealt with two constants from the white house: constant pressure to deliver on immigration, and constant chaos.

“when you are spending all of your energy preventing him from doing something illegal, you can’t then also run your state department or your defense department or your dhs,” neumann said, highlighting the challenges trump presented to cabinet secretaries. “so you’re heavily relying on the people underneath you: ‘try to do your jobs as well as possible while we protect you from the chaos.’ but everyone in the system is experiencing the same thing.”

for instance, the senate-confirmed general counsel for dhs, john mitnick, reportedly warned the white house in february 2019 that a proposal to release undocumented immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities could get dhs sued for due process violations.

in a 2019 town hall meeting with a group of dhs lawyers, according to a source present, one attendee asked mitnick what his biggest challenge was. his answer: finding time to work on anything other than immigration and border security. during the same event, mitnick told attendees that they should inform their supervisors immediately if anyone ever pressured them to greenlight an illegal action or policy, and he promised to support them. later that year, mitnick was fired.

‘bullshit’

early in nielsen’s tenure as secretary, she and taylor discussed the domestic terror threat at length. in the months before her confirmation, a far-right extremist named jeremy christian had murdered two men on a train after harassing two black teenage girls. one of the girls wore a hijab, according to news reports, and christian yelled “fuck muslims” at them. just days after nielsen was confirmed, a man with a swastika marking on his leg murdered two students at a high school in new mexico before killing himself.

“i said, ‘look this is a pretty big deal right now, it’s getting serious, a lot of it’s racially motivated,’” taylor recalled telling nielsen. “‘i don’t think we are well positioned against it. we’ve got to do more, but it’s really got to start with the president.’”

at the time, then-national security adviser h.r. mcmaster was overseeing the drafting of a new national counterterrorism strategy. the document would lay out priorities for using resources from across the u.s. government to combat terrorism.

taylor wrote a “dream draft” emphasizing everything dhs would want from the strategy document — including a focus on domestic terrorist threats, along with threats from radical islamist terrorism and other foreign actors. four months after nielsen started as dhs secretary, trump replaced mcmaster with john bolton. the process of drafting the counterterrorism strategy continued under bolton’s leadership.

“what ended up getting significantly dropped was all the stuff we talked about on domestic terrorism,” taylor said. “we got a draft back from john bolton that barely referenced domestic terrorism.”

nielsen wasn’t happy, according to taylor.

“she was like, ‘what gives?’” taylor said. “he was like, ‘we’re doing more drafts, we’re doing more turns on it, just stay tuned, we’ll work on this. and she said, ‘it’s very important to me that we emphasize domestic terrorism here. this has got to be an administration priority.’”

the final document, released on oct. 4, 2018, contained just two short paragraphs on domestic terrorism. one noted that the u.s. faced internal threats from “racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism.” a second promised that the government would “investigate ties between domestic terrorists not motivated by radical islamist ideologies and their overseas counterparts to more fully understand them.”

it was brief.

“they said, ‘we’ll come up with a separate domestic terrorism strategy,” taylor said. “bullshit. they never did. it just got lost.”

bolton declined to comment on this reporting. alyssa farah, a white house spokesperson, said the trump administration takes the domestic terrorism threat seriously.

“our country is constantly facing dynamic threats ranging from domestic, to cyber, to international, to financial crimes,” she said in a statement to politico. “our brave federal law enforcement, national security, and intelligence officials work around the clock to monitor every range of threats facing our nation, including domestic terror. this sounds more like a case of miles taylor being ineffective at his job, than an indictment of the brave men and women in security officials [sic], fbi, and federal law enforcement who work every day to protect our country from threats foreign and domestic.”

three weeks after the strategy’s release on oct. 27, 2018, a gunman named robert bowers murdered 11 people at the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh. before the massacre, he posted a message on the social networking site gab about a jewish nonprofit that helps refugees settle in the u.s.

“hias likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” he wrote of the hebrew immigrant aid society. “i can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. screw your optics. i’m going in.”

‘we’re just going to focus on the solutions’

from her perch at dhs, meanwhile, neumann pushed for the department to do more to prevent domestic terror attacks — a concept national security hands refer to as “left of boom,” as in, before an explosion hits.

the fbi is the lead law enforcement agency for investigating domestic terror. but dhs’s close work with state and local law enforcement agencies around the country — as well as private sector and community partners — means it can also play a role. for instance, advisers from dhs’s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency provided a security training that tree of life members participated in before the shooting. a top cisa official later told congress that members of the synagogue said that training saved lives.

so starting in february 2019, neumann pushed to get new funding for the new office of targeted violence and terrorism prevention. and in may 2019, neumann said, acting dhs head kevin mcaleenan made a series of phone calls to the hill ringing alarm bells that dhs’s work on domestic terrorism was severely underfunded and urging members to fund the effort. after an extensive effort that initially circumvented the white house budgeting process, congress gave dhs $17 million in new funding for the office and for grants.

the concept was to have dhs help state, local, and nongovernment leaders work in their communities to prevent and reverse violent extremism. neumann compared it with the role dhs plays in firefighting: the department doesn’t send personnel with hoses and helicopters to put out wildfires. but it does help set standards, provide training and send out grant money. the goal — both when it comes to firefighting and to domestic terrorism — is to help communities protect themselves. it grew out of the obama-era office of community partnerships. that office had focused on helping communities counter violent extremism, and the trump team had frozen its funding in the early days after the election to review its efforts.

george selim, who oversees the anti-defamation league’s center on extremism and was the first director of the office of community partnerships, said the trump administration let the office stagnate.

“you can’t snap your fingers and create an office in a cabinet-level agency,” he said. “the previous administration did all the work, found the director, hired a career staff, got a budget, got a home, gave it legal authority, went out and got grant money for it. and then the trump administration comes in and effectively does nothing with it, and it stagnates for two years plus, three years almost.”

taylor said the white house wasn’t initially all that interested in dhs’s efforts to turn the old office into a new one focused on terrorism and targeted violence.

“we were pushing the white house: ‘make this a priority, talk about this, fight for money on capitol hill for this,’” he said. “it was on deaf ears. you could not have seen a white house less interested in this.”

neumann said she wished dhs and the white house had both moved faster. there were national security council staff who wanted to strengthen the administration’s response to the growing threat, she said. but the dizzying cycle of leadership changes in the upper echelons of trump’s national security team didn’t make it easy.

“there was no nsc structure that was systematically working on issues like that,” she said. “it’s not to say that they weren’t doing things; it’s just that when you have chaos all around you, it’s really hard to do process stuff.”

on aug. 3, 2019, a gunman killed 23 people at a walmart in el paso, texas. he told investigators that he liked the christchurch killer’s manifesto, according to the wall street journal, and posted a manifesto of his own saying he wanted to kill as many hispanics as he could.

on aug. 4, a gunman killed nine people at a bar in dayton, ohio. earlier this month, per cnn, the fbi said its investigation into the killer’s motives is ongoing.

after the weekend of massacres, white house officials became more interested in neumann’s project. officials told her they could point to her work to show they took the problem seriously. she briefed multiple officials on domestic terrorism issues and what the government could do to prevent attacks. one challenge was particularly thorny, however: the officials, who neumann declined to name, didn’t want to use the term “domestic terrorism.”

“they very clearly were looking at it through the lens of, ‘we have a violence problem,’” neumann recalled. “and they did not want to talk about the ideological threat.”

“it makes me sad that in every other circumstance where you’re trying to lay out a strategy to go after a threat, you always start by articulating what the threat is,” she continued. “but in this particular case, we were told, ‘we’re just going to focus on the solutions.’”

despite that tension, trump’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal sought $80 million for dhs’s work to prevent domestic terrorism and targeted violence, along with an additional $20 million in grant money for dhs to disburse. the house greenlit that new funding. but it’s unlikely the bill will go anywhere in an election year.

a white house document touting the work was titled “combating targeted violence.”

“at dhs, your budget is always in competition for [border] wall money,” neumann said. “so it’s not insignificant to have gotten that support.”

“that’s the good news story,” she added.

neumann’s successful efforts to shave a little money off the wall budget for domestic terrorism prevention have not won her fame and fortune. but the work isn’t unnoticed. russ travers, who helmed the national counterterrorism center until this march, put it this way: “i consider her a national patriot.”

the office is now working to hire regional coordinators and disburse grant money.

“obviously, this is a very new undertaking for us,” said dhs’s current second-in-command, ken cuccinelli, in an interview with politico. “it’s somewhat untested. but that’s ok. we’ll test it. we’ll see. the challenge for even that if we go down the road five years and look backwards, is going to be the eternal challenge of understanding what you prevented. things that don’t happen are hard to measure. but that’s ok.”

the month after the el paso and dayton shootings, on sept. 20, 2019, acting dhs secretary mcaleenan signed off on a strategic framework on terrorism and targeted violence. neumann helmed the work drafting the document. mcaleenan had previously ordered an immediate review of the department’s domestic terrorism efforts when he became its acting chief, and had tasked its homeland security advisory council with specifically looking into protecting houses of worship. he recognized domestic terror was a significant emerging threat and that the department needed to shift to respond to it, former dhs official andrew meehan said.

“white supremacist violent extremism, one type of racially- and ethnically-motivated violent extremism, is one of the most potent forces driving domestic terrorism,” the mcaleenan framework document read.

the new strategic framework also promised that dhs would begin releasing a yearly state of the homeland threat assessment document. eleven months later, the first such briefing has yet to materialize.

two months after releasing the document that discussed the white supremacist threat, mcaleenan resigned from dhs. a new acting secretary, chad wolf, took his place. on jan. 17, 2020, wolf gave a speech that discussed mcaleenan’s document and terror threats.

“we’re working aggressively to develop the implementation plan, which will be ready in the coming weeks,” he said.

no such plan is public.

john cohen, the department’s former counterterrorism coordinator, said dhs could bring tremendous expertise and capabilities to the effort to fight domestic terror.

“the challenge is bringing those resources together in a cohesive, coordinated, and comprehensive way,” he added.

and, he said, the president isn’t making it easy.

“law enforcement officials are concerned that the political rhetoric used by the president to inspire his political base has been viewed by some violent white supremacists as a call to violent action, and has been viewed by a number of mentally unwell, violence-prone individuals as permission to engage in acts of violence,” he added.

‘interrogate the shit out of every single one of them’

by may 2020, the administration’s hesitancy to use the term “domestic terrorism” had evaporated — at least as far as actors from the left were concerned. after weeks of protests and property damage in portland, ore., president trump tweeted that he would designate antifa, a loose agglomeration of left-wing ‘anti-fascist’ activists, as a terrorist organization — a legal impossibility. attorney general william barr then made a statement using the phrase that so many trump administration officials have been loath to use.

“the violence instigated and carried out by antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” he said.

critics said it showed a new, broad enthusiasm to talk about domestic terrorism when the left could be blamed for it. cuccinelli told politico he rejects that criticism.

“i think it’s b.s.,” he said. “i think it’s people that want to downplay the work we’ve done in the white supremacy area. but let’s face it, what is in the news every day for the last three months? it is left-wing, organized violence.”

cuccinelli also said the department sees white supremacist domestic terrorism as a serious threat.

“obviously we’ve got white supremacist-type people we’ve got to deal with, and what we find with them is that you see smaller numbers, smaller groups, you don’t see large gatherings of them, but that when they act, the level of their lethality is higher,” he said.

senior department officials have shown a significant interest in combating the left-wing violence cuccinelli described, both publicly and privately. on a dhs leadership call in the early days of the department’s response, mark morgan––the often-bombastic and always outspoken acting head of customs and border protection — showed particular appetite for an aggressive federal response.

“we ought to detain and interrogate the shit out of every single one of them,” he said, according to two administration officials familiar with the call.

it wasn’t clear who specifically morgan was referring to. asked about this comment, a cbp spokesperson declined to comment.

earlier in his tenure as acting cbp chief, morgan also concerned officials there by floating the idea of moving a key cbp counterterrorism office under the umbrella of its office of intelligence. the office in question, called the national targeting center, plays a major role in protecting aviation from terrorism. cbp’s office of intelligence, meanwhile, focuses on border security. according to two sources familiar with the matter, cbp officials worried that morgan’s interest in moving the ntc pointed to an effort to move resources away from counterterrorism and toward border security. a cbp spokesperson also declined to comment on this reporting.

one state law enforcement official, who requested anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said the intelligence products dhs sends to its state and local partners emphasize the threat from left-wing extremists significantly more than the threat from right-wing extremists––and disproportionately so. left-wing extremists have caused numerous problems and hurt police, the state official continued. “but none of them have been killed,” the official said. “but when we look at the far right, we’ve seen numerous attacks where cops have been killed.”

“i would expect at least a balanced production between far left and far right extremists,” the official continued.

the official also said he got much more helpful information on threats from the far right from the anti-defamation league than from dhs — particularly its material on boogaloo, a coterie of extremists trying to incite a race war.

“they only have a handful of analysts at the adl, and their handful of analysts put together a better product that the entire dhs,” the official said.

earlier in the trump administration, dhs’s intelligence arm disbanded a group of analysts focused on domestic terrorism.

selim, of the adl, said dhs’s sparse material for state and local partners on far-right threats and boogaloo was concerning.

“it’s problematic,” he said. “the dhs’s mission and mandate is to protect against all threats both foreign and domestic.”

‘the deep state’

neumann said she isn’t satisfied with the progress she made and has called for an independent commission to work on how the federal government can manage the domestic terror threat.

the tendency to downplay that threat has existed in prior administrations, she noted, but the trump team has taken that tendency to an extreme. “anything domestic-related is kind of seen as the jv of the national security team,” she said.

the center for strategic and international studies — a centrist washington think tank known for its focus on international affairs and defense technology — released a briefing in june of this year concluding that the most significant terror threat to the u.s. appears to come from white supremacists. right-wing extremists were responsible for two-thirds of terror attacks and plots in the u.s. last year, it found, and for 90 percent in the first four months of 2020.

neumann left the department in april. last week, she endorsed joe biden for president. taylor and mitnick have endorsed biden as well.

“the good news is, the people who have been given the charge to protect the country — even the career officials who folks think are the deep state — they passionately care about their jobs and are going to do whatever it takes to protect the country,” she said.

U.S. sanctions Russian research institute that developed Covid-19 vaccine,1,iicu9x,https://thegrayzone.com/2020/08/28/us-sanctions-russian-research-institute-covid-19-vaccine/amp/?__twitter_impression=true,3,1598668952.0,,"the us commerce department blacklisted a russian research institute that helped create the world’s first covid-19 vaccine.

russia won the race to develop the first vaccine against the novel coronavirus. the united states has responded by slapping sanctions on a russian research facility involved in creating it.

the us government has blacklisted several russian scientific institutes, including the russian defense ministry’s 48th central research institute, which has worked with other non-military medical centers to develop and test the world’s first covid-19 vaccine.

in the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic and a historic economic crisis, washington has escalated its global campaign of economic warfare, imposing sanctions on foreign adversaries and announcing new punitive measures on a nearly daily basis.

more than one-fourth of people on earth live in countries that are suffering from us sanctions.

in april, a russian company sent ventilators to the united states as a form of humanitarian aid, to help overwhelmed hospitals treat coronavirus patients. it was later revealed that this russian firm had been under us sanctions since 2014.

state-led covid-19 vaccine research in russia, china, cuba beat us ‘public-private partnership’

the russian government announced this august that it had registered the world’s first covid-19 vaccine, called sputnik v.

sputnik v was developed by the russian health ministry’s gamaleya research institute of epidemiology and microbiology. this scientific facility created the vaccine in a joint research project with the russian defense ministry’s 48th central research institute.

on august 27, the us commerce department imposed sanctions on russia’s 48th central research institute, blacklisting the scientific body.

while russia took a state-led approach to create a coronavirus vaccine, the trump administration announced a “public-private partnership” in may. the program, called “operation warp speed,” saw the us government dole out billions of tax dollars to big pharma companies.

the trump administration awarded massive contracts to private corporations like novavax, pfizer, and moderna, while trump reportedly offered “large sums of money” for exclusive rights to a vaccine being developed by a german firm so it could be sold for profit.

but the us public-private partnership was unable to develop a vaccine before foreign countries with government-led research efforts did. besides russia, a state-owned chinese company says its vaccine will be ready by the end of 2020, while cuba is doing clinical trials for a vaccine of its own.

us blacklists russian research institutes

the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security announced a series of new sanctions measures on russian research centers in the us government’s federal register on august 27.

washington accused the blacklisted institutes of being associated with russian chemical and biological weapons programs. the kremlin denied this, calling the accusation “absolute nonsense.”

a spokesperson for the russian government called the decision “the sanctions theater of the absurd.” a kremlin press release blasted washington for being unable to “live without sanctions and without declaring restrictions for anyone every day.”

“given the scientific research of one of the institutes [which is engaged in developing russia’s coronavirus vaccine] we cannot rule out that this is another example of uncovered and rampant non-competitive struggle,” said the russian government spokesperson, dmitry peskov.

the us government’s media arm, radio free europe / radio liberty (rfe/rl), accused these russian research facilities of developing chemical and biological weapons.

at the same time, rfe/rl acknowledged, “those targeted by the u.s. commerce department include one russian defense ministry facility that is involved in russia’s attempts to develop the world’s first covid-19 vaccine.”

rfe/rl explained, “formally, the move imposes new licensing restrictions on u.s. companies that seek to do business with the blacklisted companies in russia or elsewhere.”

russian state media noted that, in addition to being used to conduct clinical trials for the covid-19 vaccine, the defense ministry’s newly blacklisted 48th central research institute is “where vaccines against ebola and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), as well as a universal flu vaccine, had been studied and successfully tested.”

the us sanctions were imposed on the following russian research institutions:

33rd scientific research and testing institute

48th central scientific research institute, kirov

48th central scientific research institute, sergiev posad

48th central scientific research institute, yekaterinburg

state scientific research institute of organic chemistry and technology

as the us commerce department blacklisted these russian research facilities, it imposed additional sanctions on two dozen chinese institutions – mostly construction, technology, and communications companies – accusing them of “engaging in activities contrary to u.s. national security interests.”"

(kcbs-tv/cbsla via ap)

los angeles (ap) — tiktok celebrities bryce hall and blake gray are facing criminal charges after they hosted recent parties in the hollywood hills despite the city’s ban on large gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said friday.

the los angeles city attorney’s office filed misdemeanor charges thursday against hall and gray. the internet celebrities with millions of followers on tiktok share a home and allegedly held two parties less than a week apart.

it was not immediately clear if hall and gray had attorneys who could speak on their behalf and efforts to reach their representatives were unsuccessful.

city attorney mike feuer said he is not aware of any covid-19 cases that have yet been linked to the aug. 8 and aug. 14 house parties, but the two-week period for symptoms to appear has not passed. los angeles police responded to both parties, which featured several hundred guests, and issued citations.

“if you have a combined 19 million followers on tiktok in the middle of a public health crisis, you should be modeling great behavior, best practices, for all of us, rather than brazenly violating the law and posting videos about it,” feuer said during a news conference friday.

hall and gray are accused of violating the city’s pandemic health order and a party house ordinance. penalties include a year in jail and up to $2,000 in fines. the aug. 14 party was reportedly to celebrate hall’s 21st birthday.

mayor eric garcetti last week authorized the city to shut off water and power to the home. “despite several warnings, this house has turned into a nightclub in the hills,” garcetti said.

with bars closed in town, large house parties can become “superspreaders” of covid-19, garcetti said.

garcetti’s action followed an aug. 3 party at a different home in the city where hundreds of people gathered without masks or social distancing. the party ended in a shooting that killed a woman and wounded two other people.

los angeles county has recorded nearly 237,000 cases of covid-19 and more than 5,700 deaths, making it the hardest-hit county in the state.

“it isn’t just the party house itself that’s affected,” feuer said. “these individuals who attend your parties could leave and spread (the virus) to siblings, to parents, to grandparents, to coworkers, to others in the public.”"
N.Y.C. Tenants Say They Were Tricked Into Appearing in R.N.C.

only after the questioning ended were the four tenants told that the interview was for the republican party, ms. perez said. but she said she was never told that it was for the convention.

ms. perez said she demanded to see the edited version of the clip, but no one ever showed it to her. she added that ms. quiñones called her minutes before the clip aired on thursday night to say that it was about to be shown.

during the pandemic, ms. perez and ms. quiñones have helped to provide hundreds of thousands of meals to residents who would not have had food otherwise. one of the vendors who provided the food, a farming company owned by muslims, called an associate of ms. perez on friday and asked why she appeared in a video supporting mr. trump, ms. perez said.

tim murtagh, a spokesman for the trump campaign, defended the handling of the video. “all interview subjects were fully aware of the purpose of the interviews,” he said. “lynne patton was acting in her own personal capacity.”

ms. patton declined to be interviewed, saying that she was traveling. but she issued a statement denying that she misled the four tenants, saying that they knew that their interviews would be shown at the convention “to increase awareness of the inhumane conditions that mayor de blasio has allowed for far too long.”

“each participated regardless of political party because they recognized the importance of having a voice on the national stage and the undeniable improvements that have transpired under this administration,” ms. patton said."
How to commit mail-in voting fraud (It's nearly impossible) - Election officials and the FBI say it's almost impossible to pull off fraud via mail-in ballots. Spreading disinformation about voting-by-mail is much easier.,438,iiyfmg,https://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-commit-mail-in-voting-fraud-its-nearly-impossible/,87,1598757677.0,,"elections 2020

millions of americans have voted by mail securely for more than 150 years, with fraud historically being so rare that election officials wouldn't even consider it significant enough to be a rounding error. but with the coronavirus pandemic pushing a record number of absentee ballot requests, president donald trump and his administration have attacked the time-tested system, claiming that it would lead to a chaotic election day outcome.

since april, trump has questioned the legitimacy of vote-by-mail on twitter, saying it will ""lead to massive corruption and fraud,"" without offering any evidence of what security flaws are present. attorney general william barr also claimed, in june, that voting by mail ""opens the floodgates to fraud,"" also without any proof.

trump reasserted the claim in a false declaration of victory on election day, suggesting that millions of mail-in votes were fraudulent and shouldn't be counted after that point. the votes have already been cast, but states like pennsylvania, wisconsin and michigan weren't able to start counting them until election day because of local election laws.

in a press briefing on election security on aug. 26, senior fbi officials said they've found no evidence of coordinated fraud with mail-in ballots and also highlighted how unlikely the scenario would be.

""it would be extraordinarily difficult to change a federal election outcome through this type of fraud alone, given the range of processes that would need to be affected or compromised by an adversary at the local level,"" the fbi said.

these attacks on mail-in voting aren't new, but they do come at a time when a record number of people in the us are expected to request absentee ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic. covid-19 has killed more than 160,000 americans, causing businesses to shut down to prevent the spread of the infectious disease; pushing people to keep their distance from each other; and leading children to attend school online or have their parties via webcam. sending in your ballot is the next logical step when trying to stay safe.

in minnesota alone, the number of requests for mail-in ballots has risen more than 16 times, to roughly 470,000, according to steve simon, minnesota's secretary of state, who doesn't buy into the concerns raised by the president.

""it would be almost impossible to pull off voter fraud on a scale that would be required to tip the balance,"" simon said. ""we have vanishingly rare cases of voter misconduct. the security precautions in place have stood the test of time.""

the real danger is that these attacks damage the credibility of our entire democratic system. election security officials have long warned that disinformation about voting is more concerning than the potential for someone to tamper with ballots. if you can get people to believe that results aren't legitimate, it doesn't matter whether fraud actually happened.

""nobody really has to successfully attack an election and demonstrate that votes were changed or ballots disappeared,"" said mike hamilton, a founder of ci security and a former chief information security officer for seattle. ""you just have to raise enough doubt in people's minds.""

the us postal service says it remains committed to delivering election mail on time, and it has been coordinating with local election officials, despite the many cuts to its services by the trump administration.

the truth is, fraud associated with mail-in ballots is exceedingly rare, and when it does happen, it's minuscule enough that it wouldn't affect the outcome, election officials and experts said, noting there are safeguards in place.

that truth gets distorted thanks to social networks. a wall street journal report found over 100 claims from trump, via twitter, attacking mail-in voting, a majority of which are factually inaccurate.

the attacks on mail-in ballots, particularly when a pandemic threatens the health of voters and election volunteers, have frustrated experts, who point out that many of the scenarios raised by the trump administration would be impossible to carry out.

""when people throw these ideas around, it shows a lack of understanding of the overall process,"" said amber mcreynolds, ceo of the national vote at home institute and coalition, and the former director of elections for denver.

how to get away with vote-by-mail fraud



trump has repeatedly made claims -- which have been disputed by election officials -- that voter fraud could happen through foreign countries printing fake ballots and rigging the election.

rigged 2020 election: millions of mail-in ballots will be printed by foreign countries, and others. it will be the scandal of our times! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 22, 2020

across the board, election security experts have pointed out just how difficult it would be to carry out election fraud on a scale large enough to actually affect the outcome. printing a fake ballot would fall into the ""nearly impossible"" category.

""the statement that other governments can print ballots and mail them to everybody is bullshit,"" hamilton said. he pointed out that each ballot has a specific barcode generated and matched to the voter, with scanners being able to tell which votes are legitimate. ""to print fake ballots with a matching barcode is not even possible.""

but in case you're curious, here's what you'd need to do to actually carry out voter fraud by mail and affect the outcome of an election.

figure out every registered voter who requested a mail-in ballot

brett pearce / cnet

not everyone's going to have a ballot automatically sent to their mailbox. for starters, you need to be registered to vote to receive one, and in some states, you need to have requested an absentee ballot to get it. election officials aren't going to count votes for people who aren't registered voters, so any nation-state looking to print fake ballots would have to make sure they're for people who actually exist. absentee ballot requests are confidential in states like north carolina, so depending on where you are, you'd have to get access to an election county's voter registration records illegally. that's not impossible: in 2016, russian hackers stole data from two florida counties' voter registration databases, but the next steps make committing fraud even more difficult.

intercept the ballot

brett pearce / cnet

now that you know who you're looking to defraud, you have to actually get their ballot to vote in their name. you can intercept the ballots by either racing to every mailbox and snatching the envelope out before the voters receive them while hoping they don't notice it's gone, or changing the voters' address so that they all send to your inbox instead. ""you have to get into the voter registration system, get their address changed and go undetected doing that,"" vote at home's mcreynolds said. ""if you're in a state that offers ballot tracking, you have to avoid voters getting a text saying 'your ballot is on its way to you' or seeing that it went to the wrong address. you have to assume they're not going to vote or pay attention in a presidential year where we're going to have the highest turnout on record."" counties across the us use ballot tracking, including virginia, florida, kansas, south carolina, michigan and illinois. ballotscout, an app from the organization democracy works, offers online tracking services for ballots where voters can see the status of their ballot the same way you'd track a package shipping. ballot envelopes have specific barcodes on them that let the us postal service know that the package is a vote, with unique serial numbers on them tied to individual voter records. if you're trying to intercept a ballot, you'll need to overcome this tracking system too. ""a voter would be able to see their ballot move through the mail stream, and they can advocate for themselves now,"" said jessenia eliza, democracy works' director of government initiatives. ""they can say they sent this ballot five days ago, it should've been received, and call the office themselves.""

get good at forging signatures and really good at guessing

brett pearce / cnet

nearly every state requires a signature on the ballot to verify a voter's identity when it's mailed in. the signatures need to match the ones logged on the voter's registration file, and is required for both issuing ballots and counting the vote. ""forging someone else's signature on an application and submitting it to receive a ballot is both extremely difficult, and a crime,"" michigan's department of state said in a statement. ""it is rarely attempted."" some states require multiple signatures, like a notary or a witness to sign off on the mail-in ballot. in north carolina, voters have to sign their ballots in front of a witness, who also signs the envelope the vote is sent in. when you register to vote in minnesota, simon said, you also have to provide your driver's license number, your state id number and the last four digits of your social security number. the state uses that to verify votes also. so once you intercept the ballot, you'd need to be able to account for all of these details too. ""unless the mailbox thief knows not only the person's personal identifying information, or which specific form they used, the joke is on the would-be thief,"" simon said. assuming you try your luck at forging signatures, some counties also have machines scanning for accuracy on the votes to make sure they match up. if it's not a good enough match, it often gets flagged to a person to check, and if enough anomalies pop up, election officials said they would investigate further.

if you've gotten through all of these security checks, congratulations: you've done something most election officials would consider nearly impossible.

but remember, you need to do this for hundreds -- if not thousands -- of people for your effort to actually affect the outcome.

laying the groundwork for disinformation

a much easier way of disrupting the process is to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election's outcome.

lawmakers are criticizing the trump administration's decision to replace the postal service's two top executives, calling it a veiled attempt to sabotage the mail system and disrupt the mail-in voting process. trump is also opposing funding to the usps that would help it handle all of the mail-in ballots.

""they want $25 billion -- billion -- for the post office. now they need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,"" trump said in an interview with fox business on aug. 13.

any delays in receiving mail-in ballots could contribute to election day uncertainty. stacking the deck against usps makes it much easier to cast doubt and disinformation about the election's outcome.

the usps also had a warning for the public.

""in order to allow sufficient time for voters to receive, complete and return ballots via the mail, and to facilitate timely receipt of completed ballots by election officials, the postal service strongly recommends that jurisdictions immediately communicate and advise voters to request ballots at the earliest point allowable but no later than 15 days prior to the election date,"" a usps spokeswoman said in a statement.

because a lot of votes came in by mail, delays are a reality in tallying the ballots. many states have deadlines to vote by mail right up until the polls close, making it unlikely to get the results on election day.

new york city's primaries took weeks to tally up its mail-in votes, and experts were concerned about the same for the general election in november. people are used to knowing who won the election that same evening. the longer the delay, the greater chance there is for disinformation and distrust to flow on social media.

""mail ballots certainly do take more time to process,"" mcreynolds said. ""we need to have a national conversation on what voting results look like.""

at a press briefing from the national association of secretaries of states on oct. 13, just three weeks before election day, election officials in michigan and new jersey estimated that it would take at least three days to finish counting all the votes that have come in.

digital doubt

disruptions can also come digitally -- election officials are frequently on alert for cyberattacks, working with government agencies like the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency to test for vulnerabilities.

there's no evidence that hackers have ever changed votes in an election, but a cyberattack could still cause concerns for officials. counties that use computers to verify signatures, for example, could be affected if those devices are vulnerable.

""a ransomware attack could affect the outcome of an election if it happens during the counting process,"" ci security's hamilton said. ""if i can encrypt your data, i have enough access to change it. how are we going to prove it wasn't changed? it's the integrity of the votes -- that's exactly where this applies.""

now playing: watch this: cisa director: paper record key to keeping 2020 election...

simon, the secretary of state of minnesota, said that while a cyberattack could cause disruptions, paper ballots and human intervention would prevent it from becoming catastrophic. people could still count the votes by hand, and even if the voter registration database was deleted, minnesota has same-day voter registration policies.

""let's say a malicious hacker deletes a bunch of voter records so that an eligible voter stops in and they tell her she's not on the list,"" simon said. ""the remedy there would be some sighs and then a re-registration. we have figured out ways to foil or at least delay the impact of those kinds of things.""

election officials can have security measures in place to prevent mail-in voter fraud and cyberattacks, but managing disinformation is going to be a much more difficult challenge.

twitter and facebook have both labeled trump's posts on mail-in voting as misleading information, but that hasn't stopped the spread of disinformation.

a propublica investigation in july found that nearly half of all top posts on facebook about voting by mail were misleading, presenting a concern more threatening than voter fraud for election officials.

""you have to retain public confidence in these systems,"" simon said. ""my worry is that there's been criticism bordering on trash-talking.""

secretaries of states agreed that trump's remarks about mail-in voting could affect confidence in the election's integrity, but don't see it having a major impact. even as trump floats the idea of mail-in voting fraud on twitter with three weeks leading up to the election, millions of voters in several states have already sent in their ballots, michigan secretary of state jocelyn benson said.

and despite trump's claims on social media, state officials said they also haven't seen any evidence of widespread voter fraud.

""the concerns that he's raised as it relates to absentee voting are not valid in ohio,"" secretary of state frank larose said. ""it's not helpful when any elected officials raise concerns about election administration and doesn't provide any evidence about those concerns."""

washington (ap) — the nation’s top intelligence official has informed congress that his office will no longer give in-person election security briefings on capitol hill, a move that raised concern among lawmakers saturday about the public’s right to know about foreign interference in the upcoming presidential election.

president donald trump said national intelligence director john ratcliffe made the decision because the administration “got tired” of intelligence about election security leaking from congress.

“they leaked the information ... and what’s even worse, they leaked the wrong information and we got tired of it,” trump told reporters while attending a briefing on hurricane laura in orange, texas. he didn’t offer details to support his statement.

sen. angus king, i-maine, said the idea that the national intelligence director’s office would stop briefing congress on foreign threats to the u.s. election is “an outrage” and that written updates were “flatly insufficient.”

“america’s election — indeed, our foundation of democracy itself — is under threat as we face weaponized disinformation from global foes around the planet,” king, a member of the senate’s intelligence committee, said in a lengthy statement. “to stifle and limit the american peoples’ awareness of this fact cannot be explained — or allowed.”

ratcliffe, who oversees the nation’s intelligence agencies, sent formal notification letters saturday to the senate and house leadership and the chairmen and ranking members of both chambers’ intelligence committees.

in the letter, ratcliffe wrote: “i believe this approach helps ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that the information odni provides the congress in support of your oversight responsibilities on elections security, foreign malign influence, and election interference is not misunderstood nor politicized.”

white house chief of staff mark meadows, who was with trump in texas, said lawmakers will still be sent full written readouts. meadows said ratcliffe is going to make sure there are “proper tools for their oversight.”

earlier this month, the nation’s counterintelligence chief, william evanina, issued a statement saying u.s. intelligence officials believe russia is using various methods to denigrate democratic presidential candidate joe biden and that people linked to russian president vladimir putin are boosting trump’s reelection bid. u.s. officials also believe china does not want trump to win a second term and has accelerated its criticism of the white house, evanina wrote.

on saturday, democratic lawmakers criticized ratcliffe’s decision.

“this intelligence belongs to the american people, not the agencies which are its custodian,” house speaker nancy pelosi and rep. adam schiff, the democrat who chairs the house’s intelligence committee, said in a joint statement. “the american people have both the right and the need to know that another nation, russia, is trying to help decide who their president should be.”

pelosi and schiff called the decision a “betrayal of the public’s right to know how foreign powers are trying to subvert our democracy.”

an official with the house intelligence committee said the decision was unexpected because ratcliffe’s office earlier had reached out to schedule an in-person briefing to the committee on sept. 17. a room on capitol hill had already been reserved, according to the official, who did not have permission to speak about the issue publicly and requested anonymity."
NYT: Rosenstein curtailed counterintelligence probe into Trump's Russia ties,290,ijgy6t,https://www.axios.com/rod-rosenstein-trump-russia-c005394f-1fc5-4097-9e1f-04b3c99b831f.html,23,1598838436.0,,"former deputy attorney general rod rosenstein told special counsel robert mueller in may 2017 to only conduct a criminal investigation of possible coordination between the trump campaign and the kremlin, secretly curtailing an fbi counterintelligence probe into president trump's ties to russia, the new york times' mike schmidt reports.

why it matters: acting fbi director andrew mccabe had approved the opening of the counterintelligence investigation out of concerns that trump's decades of personal and financial dealings in russia posed a national security threat. rosenstein, concluding that the probe lacked justification and that mccabe had conflicts of interest, never informed him of the decision.

what they're saying: ""we opened this case in may 2017 because we had information that indicated a national security threat might exist, specifically a counterintelligence threat involving the president and russia,” mccabe told the times in a statement.

""i expected that issue and issues related to it would be fully examined by the special counsel team. if a decision was made not to investigate those issues, i am surprised and disappointed. i was not aware of that.”

rosenstein declined to comment.

the big picture: because mueller — who secured more than 30 indictments but did not find sufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia — did not conduct a counterintelligence investigation, democrats say the full scope of trump's russia ties remains unknown."
New CDC report shows 94% of COVID-19 deaths in US had contributing conditions,0,ijn55e,https://fox8.com/news/coronavirus/new-cdc-report-shows-94-of-covid-19-deaths-in-us-had-underlying-medical-conditions/,9,1598859259.0,,"atlanta, ga. (wjw) — the centers for disease control and prevention released new data last week that depicts how many americans who have died from covid-19 also had other contributing conditions.

according to the report, only 6% of deaths have covid-19 as the only cause mentioned, revealing that 94% of patients who died from coronavirus also had other “health conditions and contributing causes.”

the report reads in part:

table 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). for 6% of the deaths, covid-19 was the only cause mentioned. for deaths with conditions or causes in addition to covid-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.

the cdc listed the following as the top conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavirus disease:

influenza and pneumonia

respiratory failure

hypertensive disease

diabetes

vascular and unspecified dementia

cardiac arrest

heart failure

renal failure

intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events

other medical conditions

the cdc explains that their data uses provisional death counts to “deliver the most complete and accurate picture of lives lost to covid-19.”

these numbers are based on death certificates, which the organization says are the most reliable source of data. death certificates reportedly contain information that is not available anywhere else and includes comorbid conditions, race and ethnicity, and place of death.

the cdc says provisional death counts may not match counts from other sources, such as numbers from county health departments, because death certificates take time to be completed, states report at different rates, it takes officials extra time to code covid-19 deaths, and because other reporting systems use different definitions or methods for counting deaths.

the organization adds that provisional data is not yet complete, provisional counts are not final and are subject to change, and that death counts should not be compared across states.

RNC airs video clip of ‘Biden’s America’ — it was actually Barcelona,241,ijnwn0,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rnc-airs-video-clip-biden-s-america-it-was-actually-n1238565,96,1598862264.0,,"the republican national convention aired a video on its first night decrying protests in the united states and citing potential chaos in the streets if democratic nominee joe biden is elected president.

one problem with the video? one part showed a different protest, in a different country, in a different year.

nbc news’ social newsgathering team was able to identify that a portion of the video was in fact taken during catalonia independence protests in spain in october 2019 and not during recent protests in the united states over racial injustice and police brutality. catalonian public broadcaster, cca, was first to report on the misinformation on aug. 25.

the video, which has since been posted on president trump’s official youtube account, is titled “catalina and madeline” and features two chicago-area sisters, catalina and madeline lauf, who discuss their conservative beliefs and their support for the president.

“this is a taste of biden’s america,” one of the sisters narrates as photos and videos of protests flash on screen. “the rioting, the crime. freedom is at stake now and this is going to be the most important election of our lifetime.”

while the imagery appears to allude to the recent american protests after the fatal encounter of george floyd with minneapolis police in may, the 4:16 mark of the video shows cars, street signs, and trash on fire in the middle of the street as people run by the blaze — in barcelona.

that segment of the video aired by the rnc matches an undated video from shutterstock, titled “young rebel riot revolutionary anarchist.” shutterstock is often used as a source for stock photos and videos.

while the shutterstock video doesn’t specify the location or date it was taken, getty images, a photo and video agency, captured a video of the same incident from a different angle. getty’s description of their video states that the demonstrators clashed with police on oct. 16, 2019, in barcelona, spain, after nine catalan separatist leaders were sentenced for their involvement in the province's 2017 failed referendum on independence.

nbc news’ social newsgathering team geolocated the specific street in barcelona where this clash with police occurred. in the google maps street view of the location, 113 carrer de roger de flor, numerous doorway arches and balconies can be seen, which match those seen in the segment of video used in the rnc video.

WGN America’s ‘NewsNation’ looks for viewers who want their news served up opinion-free,116,ikh1vf,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-08-31/wgn-americas-newsnation-looks-for-viewers-who-want-their-news-served-up-opinion-free,31,1598980640.0,,"when entrepreneur ted turner first launched cnn in the early 1980s without any big name anchors, one of his credos was that the news would be the star of his then-revolutionary new network.

but cable news has evolved in recent years to offer up a steady diet of personalities, politics and points of view. those elements have driven up the audiences for fox news, msnbc and cnn to record levels at a time when other tv networks are struggling to hold onto viewers gravitating to streaming services for their favorite dramas, sitcoms and movies.

nexstar media group, the irving, texas-based tv station owner which acquired cable network wgn america as part of its 2019 purchase of tribune media, believes the shift to more talk and opinion on cable news has created an opportunity.

on tuesday, the company will launch “newsnation,” a nightly three-hour national prime time newscast (8 p.m. eastern and 5 p.m. pacific) that promises a neutral, opinion-free presentation of the day’s events, on wgn america.

if successful, nexstar could expand the format into additional hours and over time turn wgn america, which now airs sitcom and drama reruns, into a serious cable news competitor. like nearly every other entertainment cable channel, wgn america is losing viewers to streaming services and cord-cutting, and live news offers a chance at reinvention.

sean compton, executive vice president for wgn america, said the company has done extensive research that determined there is an appetite for straight-ahead tv news in the evening as an alternative to opinion hosts such as fox news star sean hannity and cnn’s don lemon.

“sean hannity is not news,” said compton. “he’s a friend of mine. i worked with him in radio for years. he’d get mad at me for saying that, but it’s true. tucker carlson and don lemon — that’s not news.”

nexstar executives insist their promise of a politically neutral newscast is more than a marketing gimmick. among the 150 people hired for the chicago-based program (a process jennifer lyons, vice president of news for wgn america, described as “speed dating on zoom”) are two producers dedicated to scrutinizing every story for language that could be construed as biased.

a team of rhetoricians — made up of media consultants and academics — have also been lined up to monitor the fairness of its coverage. each night they will deliver a report on how the program fared to lyons’ desk.

rob nelson, a “newsnation” anchor hired from new york tv station wabc, is aware that positioning the program as an unbiased option will put it under a microscope.

“it’s a different level of scrutiny and quite honestly in the era we’re living in right now, saying ‘newsnation’ is balanced is putting a big target on our backs and people will be looking for anything that suggests otherwise,” nelson said as he prepared for rehearsal before the launch. “so we have no choice but to get it right because we will be called out by one side or the other very quickly if we don’t.”

advertisement

anchors and reporters have gone through sessions where their work is analyzed in the run-up to the program’s premiere.

joe donlon, a “newsnation” anchor who came from nexstar’s local chicago station, said there have been debates with producers over the language used in some of the pieces he has written for the rehearsal programs. but he has been willing to adapt.

“i’m not above someone looking at my work and saying ‘i think it would be better with this,’” donlon said.

even without the challenge of enforcing a high standard of journalistic neutrality, launching a new national news operation is a risky and expensive venture.

the company’s 185 tv stations with 5,400 employees in their local newsrooms will supply much of the reporting from around the country for “news nation.” the program will have a bureau and a dedicated west coast correspondent, nancy loo, working out of nexstar’s los angeles station ktla. reuters will supply international coverage.

advertisement

the three weekday anchors — nelson, donlon and marni hughes along with meteorologist albert ramon — are from local news outlets and did not command the large salaries it would have taken to attract established network news personalities.

the approach helped keep the cost of the “newsnation” launch to around $20 million, executives said. nexstar local stations, which cover 63% of the country, will use their air time to provide the bulk of promotional time for the program, valued at more than $100 million.

the company said it will offset most of the start-up costs by not renewing deals for several of the entertainment shows carried on wgn america, which reaches 75 million cable and satellite homes in the u.s.

compton said having anchors without a national profile means “newsnation” viewers will not have any preconceived notions based on their past places of employment. the only on-air journalists with network experience are nelson, who once anchored abc’s overnight newscast, and newly hired veteran correspondent dean reynolds, who departed cbs news’ chicago bureau after a recent round of cutbacks (wgn america recruited him through his linkedin account shortly after he was let go).

even the studio location for “newsnation” will separate it from the competition. instead of being based in the glitzy media hubs of new york and washington, the program will air from the headquarters of nexstar tv station wgn-tv, located in a 59-year-old utilitarian white brick building on chicago’s north side where the channel’s bozo the clown children’s show was taped for decades.

one floor above the main studio is a spacious newsroom built for “newsnation” where socially-distanced producers are stationed by the region of the country they are covering.

compton said the stories from nexstar’s local stations for “newsnation” will be presented in a way that connects to a national audience.

“you’re not going to see the ‘pet of the week’ from indianapolis,” he said.

compton noted that when a story occurs such as the college football season at texas tech being in jeopardy due to the pandemic, “news nation” can go to the nexstar station in lubbock, texas, for a live report that illustrates the challenges the public health crisis still presents throughout the country.

“we’re really working a new muscle,” said hughes, who worked as an anchor in seattle before joining wgn america. “in local news we take national news and localize it to make our community care about it. now we’re doing the opposite.”

on election night, “newsnation” will have journalists from nexstar stations in most of the key swing states when the returns for the 2020 presidential race come in. the program will expand beyond three hours that night and on other occasions when there are breaking stories.

for nexstar, “newsnation” is also a chance to adapt to the changing tv landscape.

as viewing of scripted tv shows continues to shift online, live television is the best way to reach viewers with commercial messages. nexstar chief executive perry sook told financial analysts earlier this month that wgn america is already selling advertising for “newsnation” at a higher rate than the programming it’s replacing.

the company has not revealed its ratings goals for “newsnation,” but people familiar with the discussions said wgn america is looking to average 100,000 viewers a night in the 25 to 54 age group advertisers want to reach with news programming.

the figure is about 25% of what cnn averaged in prime time during the month of july. the program will also air on weekends and have an app and website updated 24 hours a day.

news ranks right behind sports as the key reason consumers keep their pay tv subscriptions. nexstar said ratings for news on its local stations has surged this year due to the pandemic, even increasing among the 18 to 34 age group that has turned away from traditional tv.

advertisement

but established news viewing habits are hard to break. mark whitaker, a veteran journalist who has held top executive posts at cnn and msnbc, knows that from experience.

“it really helps that a chunk of your viewership wakes up in the morning and turns you on and leaves you on all day,” he said. “msnbc has that and so does fox news.”

whitaker recalled how cnn ratings fluctuated wildly based on the intensity of the news environment during his tenure from 2011 to 2013. a key reason executives who succeeded him added documentary-style series programming and opinionated personalities in prime time was to create a more reliable audience.

msnbc was adrift as a cable news competitor until it was “consciously a channel for liberals,” whitaker noted. fox news was defined clearly from its start as a conservative counterweight to viewers who saw established news sources as too liberal.

advertisement

whitaker said the question nexstar will face is whether viewers who want a straight-ahead newscast will become as “addicted” as those who regularly tune into cnn, msnbc and fox news.

some who do not watch cable news may be satisfied with the down-the-middle presentations of “pbs newshour” or the half-hour evening newscasts on abc, cbs and nbc, which collectively still average more than 20 million viewers a night.

“i would say there is an audience that says they are underserved,” whitaker said. “the question is do they want something like ‘newsnation’ enough that they would watch it day after day and hour after hour the way they do the existing channels. people love rachel maddow no matter what’s going on.”

“newsnation” is likely to get noticed by a heavy news viewer in the white house.

compton produced a regular nationally syndicated radio commentary segment for president trump from 2004 to 2008 during his years on nbc’s “the apprentice.” he remains friendly with trump and noted that the tv savvy commander-in-chief is already aware of the new nexstar venture.

“i haven’t made a big deal about it when i’ve talked to him because he’s probably not going to like it every night,” compton said."
Eurozone unemployment spike held down by support schemes,15,ikjcx2,https://apnews.com/055d92b31111c88eee56d784d51c41e9,3,1598992202.0,,"file - in this wednesday, april 29, 2020 file photo, a man walks in front of the european central bank in frankfurt, germany. official figures tuesday sept. 1, 2020, shows the unemployment rate across the 19 countries that use the euro currency rose modestly to 7.9% in july as the jobless spike was held down by temporary government job-support programs and the relaxation of some coronavirus containment measures.

(ap photo/michael probst, file)

frankfurt, germany (ap) — at first glance, unemployment across the 19 countries that use the euro currency appears remarkably low in the face of a savage recession brought on by the coronavirus. it’s unlikely to remain so over the coming months as government support measures start to expire.

official figures show that the eurozone’s unemployment rate rose modestly to 7.9% in july as job losses were held down by temporary government job-support programs. but weaker inflation amid sweeping announcement of layoffs suggest that the eurozone economy faces a long struggle to recover.

the eurozone’s overall jobless rate inched up from 7.7% in june as the number of people labeled as unemployed increased by 344,000, according to eurostat. in the same month a year earlier the jobless rate was 7.5% by comparison, the u.s. unemployment rate has leapt from 3.6% at the start of the year to 14.7% in april before falling to 10.2% in july. some u.s. businesses got forgivable loans if they kept people on under a paycheck protection program.

government programs that temporarily pay most of workers’ wages if companies put them on shorter hours or no hours have helped keep millions on the job — but the respite may not last as the programs come to an end and the coronavirus continues to restrict travel and activity.

“when the clock strikes midnight, however, and short-time work schemes come to an end, the fairy tale is unlikely to continue,” said analysts at ing bank. “we expect a second wave of job losses towards the end of the year and going into 2021 although the peak in unemployment should still remain below the highs seen in the aftermath of the financial crisis.”

major employers have announced thousands of layoffs to counter what is expected to be reduced business in the months ahead. some are household names such as automaker renault, airline lufthansa, travel company tui, and industrial conglomerate thyssenkrupp.

virus cases have risen in spain, france and germany in recent days, raising fears of a further wave of restrictions on gatherings and activity.

a further sign of weakness in the eurozone economy was evident in august inflation figures showing consumer prices falling by 0.2% from the year before. the negative reading was down from a 0.4% increase in july. analysts attributed some of the drop to the late timing of summer sales in france and italy and to a cut in sales taxes paid on consumer purchases in germany.

the european central bank is pumping 1.35 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion) in newly printed money into the economy through bond purchases, a step aimed at pushing up inflation to more normal levels and supporting the recovery. ecb officials have said the bank intends to use the full amount due to the bank’s baseline expectation for a very subdued inflation outlook.

core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, sagged to 0.4% from 1.2%. that is a sign of ongoing weakness in demand, said jack allen-reynolds, senior europe economist at capital economics. he said the jobs and inflation figures released tuesday “put the ecb’s challenge in stark relief” compared with the situation facing the u.s. federal reserve.

“while the fed has recently announced that it will tolerate above-2% inflation, the ecb is struggling even to hit its more modest aim of ‘below, but close to, 2%’ inflation,” allen-reynolds said. “monetary policy in the eurozone will need to remain extremely loose for many more years to come.”"

president donald trump talks to business owners tuesday, sept. 1, 2020, as he tours an area damaged during demonstrations after a police officer shot jacob blake in kenosha, wis. (ap photo/evan vucci)

kenosha, wis. (ap) — president donald trump stood at the epicenter of the latest eruption over racial injustice tuesday and came down squarely on the side of law enforcement, blaming “domestic terror” for the violence in kenosha, wisconsin, and making no nod to the underlying cause of anger and protests — the shooting of yet another black man by police.

trump declared the violence “anti-american.” he did not mention jacob blake, who was left paralyzed after being shot in the back seven times by an officer last week in kenosha.

soon after arriving in the city, a visit made over the objections of state and local leaders, trump toured the charred remains of a block besieged by violence and fire. with the scent of smoke still in the air, he spoke to the owners of a century-old store that had been destroyed and continued to link the violence to the democrats, blaming those in charge of kenosha and wisconsin while raising apocalyptic warnings if their party should capture the white house.

“these are not acts of peaceful protest but, really, domestic terror,” said trump. and he condemned democratic officials for not immediately accepting his offer of federal enforcement assistance, claiming, “they just don’t want us to come.”

the city has been the scene of protests since the aug. 23 shooting of blake, who was shot as he tried to get into a car while police were trying to arrest him. protests have been concentrated in a small area of kenosha. while there were more than 30 fires set in the first three nights, the situation has calmed since then.

trump’s motorcade passed throngs of demonstrators, some holding american flags in support of the president, others jeering while carrying signs that read black lives matter. a massive police presence, complete with several armored vehicles, secured the area, and barricades were set up along several of the city’s major thoroughfares to keep onlookers at a distance from the passing presidential vehicles.

offering federal resources to help rebuild the city, trump toured a high school that had been transformed into a heavily fortified law enforcement command post. he said he tried to call blake’s mother but opted against it after the family asked that a lawyer listen in.

trump later added he felt “terribly” for anyone who suffered a loss, but otherwise only noted that the situation was “complicated” and “under investigation.” the only words acknowledging the concerns of african americans came from a pastor who attended trump’s law enforcement roundtable.

pressed by reporters, trump repeatedly pivoted away from assessing any sort of structural racism in the nation or its police departments, instead blasting what he saw as anti-police rhetoric. painting a dark portrait of parts of the nation he leads, the president predicted that chaos would descend on cities across america if voters elect democrat joe biden to replace him in november.

biden hit back, speaking to donors on a fundraising call after trump left kenosha.

“donald trump has failed to protect america. so now he’s trying to scare the hell out of america,” biden said. “violence isn’t a problem in donald trump’s eyes. it’s a political strategy.”

the election is playing out in “anxious times,” with “multiple crises,” biden said. he included police violence in the list, along with the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, and said trump refuses to address any of them honestly.

trump aides believe that his tough-on-crime stance will help him with voters and that the more the national discourse is about anything other than the coronavirus, the better it is for the president.

biden said after trump’s wisconsin visit: “the vast majority of cops are honorable, decent and real. but the idea that he wouldn’t even acknowledge the problem — and white nationalists are raising their heads all across the country.”

trump condemned unrest in portland, oregon, too, where a supporter was shot and killed recently — and an increase in shootings in cities including chicago and new york — and tried to take credit for stopping the violence in kenosha with the national guard. but it was wisconsin’s democratic governor, tony evers, who deployed the guard to quell demonstrations in response to the blake shooting, and he had pleaded with trump to stay away for fear of straining tensions further.

“i am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing,” evers wrote in a letter to trump. “i am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.”

biden has assailed trump as an instigator of the deadly protests that have sprung up on his watch. on the eve of his visit, trump defended a teenager accused of fatally shooting two men at a demonstration in kenosha last week, though he did not mention the young man tuesday.

claiming the mantle of the “law and order” republican candidate, trump insists that he, not biden, is the leader best positioned to keep americans safe. he said his appearance in kenosha would “increase enthusiasm” in wisconsin, perhaps the most hotly contested battleground state in the presidential race.

blake’s family held a tuesday “community celebration” at a distance from trump’s visit.

“we don’t need more pain and division from a president set on advancing his campaign at the expense of our city,” justin blake, an uncle, said in a statement. “we need justice and relief for our vibrant community.”

the naacp said tuesday neither candidate should visit the wisconsin city as tension simmers. biden’s team has considered a visit to kenosha and had previously indicated that a trip to wisconsin was imminent but has not offered details.

protests in kenosha began the night of blake’s shooting, aug. 23, and were concentrated in the blocks around the county courthouse downtown. there was an estimated $2 million in damage to city property, and kenosha’s mayor has said he is seeking $30 million from the state to help rebuild.

trump announced tuesday that his administration was making $5 million available to the city and sending than $42 million to the state, with most of the funding aimed at bolstering law enforcement, he said.

the violence reached its peak the night of aug. 25, two days after blake was shot, when police said the 17-year-old armed with an illegal semi-automatic rifle shot and killed two protesters in the streets. since then marches organized both by backers of police and blake’s family have all been peaceful with no vandalism or destruction to public property.

biden, all the while, has tried to refocus the race on what has been its defining theme — trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 180,000 americans dead — after a multi-day onslaught by the president’s team to make the campaign about the violence rattling american cities.

biden’s wife, jill, on tuesday kicked off a multi-week, 10-city tour of schools disrupted by the pandemic in eight battleground states, drawing a direct line from the empty classrooms to the administration’s failures combating covid-19.

during her tour of a wilmington, delaware, school, she spoke with teachers and administrators about doubts that in-person learning will actually resume anytime soon and the challenges — including obtaining new small desks and protective equipment to make sure classrooms can handle social distancing — if they do. she said feelings about heading back to school “have turned from excitement into anxiety, and the playgrounds are still.”

The Trump Administration Is Backing Out of a $647 Million Ventilator Deal After ProPublica Investigated the Price,269,ikv1gj,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-trump-administration-is-backing-out-of-a-647-million-ventilator-deal-after-propublica-investigated-the-price,18,1599030109.0,,"propublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

the federal government is backing out of a controversial $646.7 million deal to buy ventilators from royal philips n.v., acting before the company had delivered a third of the order.

the deal has been the focus of several propublica stories since march. that reporting prompted a congressional investigation that last month found “evidence of fraud, waste and abuse” in the acquisition of the philips ventilators.

this week, the house committee on oversight and reform’s subcommittee on economic and consumer policy announced it is expanding its probe to look at other coronavirus-related deals negotiated by peter navarro, the president’s trade adviser, who served as the point man on the philips deal.

in addition, the u.s. department of health and human services, which oversaw the philips contract, confirmed that the deal is the subject of an internal investigation and legal review.

“it was propublica’s reporting that got my subcommittee interested in this contract,” rep. raja krishnamoorthi, the illinois democrat who chairs the subcommittee, said in a statement. “it prompted our investigation where we uncovered unfathomably inept dealmaking by top administration officials like peter navarro.”

navarro did not respond to a request for comment. but sarah matthews, a white house spokeswoman, defended navarro on tuesday, saying he has “played a vital role in our response” to the pandemic, helping to oversee the use of a federal act that compelled production of critical supplies and created “thousands of jobs in the process.”

“while the trump administration has been focused on saving lives, house democrats continue to focus on pointless investigations,” she wrote.

philips, a dutch company, announced monday that its u.s. factories had stopped making the ventilators covered by the contract after receiving an early termination notice from hhs. philips has delivered 12,300 ventilators, less than a third of the 43,000 the federal government had originally sought.

the congressional investigation determined that the deal would have resulted in the u.s. overpaying for the ventilators by as much as $500 million, thanks to “inept contract management and incompetent negotiating by the trump administration.”

propublica first wrote about the u.s. government’s relationship with philips in march, detailing how a decade ago government planners had paid philips millions of dollars to develop a low-cost ventilator that could be stockpiled and deployed if ever there were a pandemic. the u.s. ordered 10,000 once the company received clearance from the food and drug administration.

but when covid-19 cases overwhelmed hospitals in new york in the spring, philips hadn’t delivered any. instead, propublica found, philips was selling a commercial version of that ventilator — manufactured at its pennsylvania factory — overseas at far higher prices.

rather than force production of low-cost ventilators, a white house team led by navarro cut a new deal for more ventilators, agreeing to pay more than four times the price.

propublica in april revealed that this new deal boosted the price of what appeared to be similar ventilators from $3,280 each under the obama administration deal to $15,000 under the trump administration. neither philips nor hhs would explain how the two models were different.

in its investigation of the deal, the house subcommittee asked philips to turn over a trove of records and discovered that the more expensive ventilators were “functionally identical” to the cheaper ones.

navarro and his team “appeared gullible” and there was no evidence that they even tried to negotiate a lower price, the house investigators found.

the u.s. government paid the highest price for the ventilators among american buyers, the investigators found. the company’s records show that philips had sold more than 5,000 of that model at far lower prices before may 27.

philips ceo frans van houten said earlier this summer that his company did not raise prices to cash in on the coronavirus crisis and did not agree with the conclusions of the congressional investigators.

read more taxpayers paid millions to design a low-cost ventilator for a pandemic. instead, the company is selling versions of it overseas. as coronavirus sweeps the globe, there is not a single trilogy evo universal ventilator — developed with government funds — in the u.s. stockpile. meanwhile, royal philips n.v. has sold higher-priced versions to clients around the world.

this week a philips spokesman said that the list price of the ventilator was $21,000 and that the negotiated price of $15,000 reflected the “higher costs for the expedited delivery schedule.”

“while we are disappointed in light of these vast efforts, we will adjust our plans and work with hhs to effectuate the partial termination of this contract,” van houten said in a written statement monday.

it’s not clear how much the deal will ultimately cost taxpayers. philips, hhs and the white house all declined to say whether the company would be paid an early termination fee.

stephanie bialek, a spokeswoman for the hhs office in charge of the strategic national stockpile, said in a statement that the government has 120,000 ventilators available and didn’t face any shortages. she said her agency had also terminated two other smaller ventilator deals early as it balanced “federal stockpile requirements with commercial market demand for ventilators.”

“as a result, hhs is saving the u.s. taxpayer millions of dollars by halting delivery of additional ventilators that are no longer required,” bialek wrote.

separately, the hhs office of inspector general announced in july that it was auditing the five largest ventilator contracts to determine whether the awarding and monitoring of the contracts complied with federal requirements and hhs policies.

as for the 10,000 low-cost ventilators the u.s. ordered for the stockpile years ago, they will arrive eventually. philips spokesman steve klink said the company still planned to deliver them by september 2022, when they are due."

New Taiwan passports to emphasize distinction with China,234,il5vfn,https://apnews.com/dd1291326ec6829d12d116cbc20b131b,7,1599078602.0,,"in this sep. 2, 2020, photo released by the executive yuan, taiwan's foreign minister joseph wu, center, and executive yuan spokesperson evian ting, left, and director of consular affairs bureau phoebe yeh attends a news conference to reveal the new taiwan passport in taipei, taiwan.

(executive yuan via ap)

taipei, taiwan (ap) — taiwan plans to issue new passports emphasizing its independent identity and downgrading connections with china.

the foreign ministry on wednesday released images of the new document that features “taiwan” in large capital letters on its cover and minimizes the english wording “republic of china,” the island’s official name according to its constitution.

taiwan was handed over from japanese to chinese rule in 1945. four years later, chiang kai-shek relocated the republic of china and its institutions to the island as mao zedong’s communist party swept to power on the mainland in the chinese civil war.

taiwan has since shrugged off political connections with china as part of its transition to full democracy. however, it has retained republic of china as its official name, along with the constitution, flag and state institutions brought from china.

despite the political divide, china continues to claim taiwan as its own territory and has required foreign countries and multinational companies to refer to the island as a part of china.

asked about the passport change at a daily briefing, chinese foreign ministry spokesperson hua chunying said “the fact that taiwan is an inalienable part of china will never change” regardless of what “tricks” are played by the governing pro-independence democratic progressive party.

beijing also responded angrily when “taiwan” was added to the cover of the taiwanese passport more than a decade ago and has increasingly lashed out at assertions of the island’s political independence.

china does not recognize taiwanese passports and requires citizens of the island traveling to the mainland to use a chinese-issued document.

the change in passport design, to take effect in january, aims to prevent confusion between travelers from taiwan and those from china, taiwanese foreign minister joseph wu told reporters.

he said the ministry has informed the international air transport association, foreign governments, airports, airlines and immigration authorities about the change and provided them with samples of the new design.

the passport redesign was mandated in a resolution passed by the legislature in july, which also called for a change in the logo of taiwan’s government-owned china airlines, sometimes confused with chinese flag carrier air china."
Dem group warns of apparent Trump Election Day landslide,48,il6dom,https://www.axios.com/bloomberg-group-trump-election-night-scenarios-a554e8f5-9702-437e-ae75-d2be478d42bb.html,42,1599080623.0,,"a top democratic data and analytics firm told ""axios on hbo"" it's highly likely that president trump will appear to have won — potentially in a landslide — on election night, even if he ultimately loses when all the votes are counted.

why this matters: way more democrats will vote by mail than republicans, due to fears of the coronavirus, and it will take days if not weeks to tally these. this means trump, thanks to republicans doing almost all of their voting in person, could hold big electoral college and popular vote leads on election night.

imagine america, with its polarization and misinformation, if the vote tally swings wildly toward joe biden and trump loses days later as the mail ballots are counted.

that is what this group, hawkfish, which is funded by michael bloomberg and also does work for the democratic national committee and pro-biden super pacs, is warning is a very real, if not foreordained, outcome.

what they're saying: hawkfish ceo josh mendelsohn calls the scenario a ""red mirage.""

""we are sounding an alarm and saying that this is a very real possibility, that the data is going to show on election night an incredible victory for donald trump,"" he said.

""when every legitimate vote is tallied and we get to that final day, which will be some day after election day, it will in fact show that what happened on election night was exactly that, a mirage,"" mendelsohn said. ""it looked like donald trump was in the lead and he fundamentally was not when every ballot gets counted.""

data: hawkfish; graphic: axios visuals

by the numbers: under one of the group's modeling scenarios, trump could hold a projected lead of 408-130 electoral votes on election night, if only 15% of the vote by mail (vbm) ballots had been counted.

once 75% of mail ballots were counted, perhaps four days later, the lead could flip to biden's favor.

this particular modeling scenario portrays biden as ultimately winning a massive victory, 334-204.

the methodology, described in detail below, was based in part on polling from fivethirtyeight in august.

the ultimate results may well sit somewhere between these low-end and high-end scenarios and will also be impacted by who actually votes, and how voters' views about their options change over the coming weeks.

the other side: “the news media should get out of the business of predicting the future,” trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh said in response.

between the lines: hawkfish is not just trying to educate the public about the possibility that trump could prematurely declare victory, or try to delegitimize a biden victory if it took days or weeks to determine.

the group is also trying to sensitize state and county elections officials, news and social media organizations, and the courts to the perils of premature results — and to the possibility of trump and his team applying challenges and political pressure to reject a high share of mailed-in ballots counted after election day.

and the group is warning voters that rejection rates for mail ballots are higher than in-person voting.

to avoid having their votes thrown out, hawkfish is advising voters to be extra careful about voting early enough and following all the instructions to the letter — or, potentially, putting on masks and gloves and going early either to safely vote in person or return the mail ballot in person.

methodology: hawkfish surveyed 17,263 registered voters in 50 states and dc, july 1-aug. 16, 2020, to assess who people planned to vote for and whether they intend to vote by mail or in person at a polling place."
"At Voice of America, Trump Appointee Sought Political Influence Over Coverage",84,il6q46,https://www.npr.org/2020/09/02/907984631/at-voice-of-america-trump-appointee-sought-political-influence-over-coverage,2,1599081922.0,,"at voice of america, trump appointee sought political influence over coverage

enlarge this image toggle caption u.s. agency for global media u.s. agency for global media

at the voice of america, staffers say the trump appointee leading their parent agency is threatening to wash away legal protections intended to insulate their news reports from political meddling.

""what we're seeing now is the step-by-step and wholescale dismantling of the institutions that protect the independence and the integrity of our journalism,"" says shawn powers, until recently the chief strategy officer for the u.s. agency for global media, which oversees voa.

voice of america's mission is a form of soft diplomacy: to embody democratic principles through fair reporting and to replace a free press in countries where there is none. voa and its four sister networks together reach more than 350 million people abroad each week.

since taking office in june, pack has upended the agency. in a podcast interview last week with the pro-trump website the federalist, pack said he had to take action because many executives and journalists were disregarding the agency's ethical standards.

""my job really is to drain the swamp, to root out corruption and to deal with these issues of bias, not to tell journalists what to report,"" pack told host chris bedford. pack has declined npr's repeated and detailed requests for comment.

but it appears that pack is, in fact, interested in influencing which stories get told, and how. the senior news editor who oversaw voa's standards and practices was reassigned to a corporate position earlier this summer and has since played no role in guiding coverage or scrutinizing stories flagged as problematic.

and journalists say they are being second-guessed more frequently than they had come to expect. in two cases, stories were removed from voa's websites after questions were raised. npr has uncovered an additional instance in which the voice of america's legal assurance of journalistic independence — known as a ""firewall"" — appears to have been explicitly violated by pack and the team he has brought in.

'unprecedented' involvement of political appointee

""it's unprecedented in the agency's modern history,"" says powers. ""it seems to contradict all the major norms as it relates to the integrity of the editorial process.""

officials and journalists aware of the episode say it deeply troubled them because it involved voa's urdu-language service's coverage of democratic presidential nominee joe biden — which is to say, trump's chief political rival.

according to five current and former staffers with knowledge of what happened, a political appointee at the u.s. agency for global media, samuel e. dewey, conducted a formal review of a video story about biden's outreach to muslims after pack publicly denounced the story. the urdu-language service is primarily intended to reach audiences in pakistan, so it is unlikely that many american voters saw the video.

that said, the reporting was widely conceded to have been flawed: it presented biden's appeal without offering greater context or outside analysis of biden's claims about trump. (for example, biden referred to trump's travel ""ban"" on muslims but the report did not note the administration's policy barred people traveling from certain muslim-majority nations.)

typically, such reviews would be conducted by journalists well versed in the profession's standards and ethics as well as by some experts in the subject covered. dewey has no such background. he is a lawyer who has led committee investigations for republican lawmakers on capitol hill, according to his bio on linkedin. he frequently tweets out pro-trump sentiments and memes.

after dewey's review, several contractors were dismissed and an editor was placed on leave.

and yet some journalists were struck by a tweet from the account of voa noticias, the network's spanish-language service. it simply conveyed a video from a trump campaign adviser warning latinos against voting for biden. like the biden report, it had no added context. the tweet was later removed, but no formal reviews or repercussions ensued.

an agency spokesman, jonathan bronitsky, said usagm would not reply to questions posed about the biden video and the aftermath.

dewey has raised concerns about other voa stories as well. he has repeatedly pushed to participate in planning for election reporting and overarching news coverage, according to colleagues, which voa staffers resisted. dewey declined to comment to npr.

this story is based on interviews with 18 current and former executives and journalists at the u. s. agency for global media and the voice of america. citing the tumult and firings at the agency, most would not speak to npr on the record, saying they feared for their jobs or professional reputations.

voa acting director elez biberaj, an historian and veteran of the news service, declined to comment.

a staff purge and a toilet paper shortage

pack took office in june and quickly upended the federal broadcasters. already, he has fired or suspended most of the executive staff and nearly all the heads of his agency's networks, which include radio free europe and radio free asia. he has withheld approval of visa extensions that foreign employees need to continue working for those networks. a return home without u.s. protection could leave some employees and their families vulnerable to regimes hostile to the u.s. government.

president trump first nominated pack, a filmmaker who has previously collaborated with former trump strategist steve bannon, in 2018. the nomination languished in the senate until this year. it found new life after trump and the white house attacked the voice of america in the spring for its coverage of the covid-19 pandemic. in an unusual statement, the white house condemned voa for failing to blame the chinese sufficiently for the pandemic's spread, claiming it had fallen for the regime's propaganda.

in response, voa's director at the time, amanda bennett, pointed to numerous stories critical of china. she resigned immediately following pack's confirmation by the u.s. senate.

by sweeping knowledgeable staffers away and even refusing to approve standard budgets, eight current or former staffers for usagm and voice of america said, the agency under pack had in many ways broken down. officials say they were unable to fulfill orders for toilet paper for a transmitting facility, or a cleaning contract for a shortwave broadcasting center in kuwait.

""maybe this is their strategy,"" says grant turner, the usagm former acting ceo who was suspended as chief financial officer in august. ""maybe they think they only have a short amount of time here and the best thing they can do is fire as many people as possible, break as many things as possible, starve folks of resources.""

publicly, pack accused executives of severe and systemic security failures, though former officials say the agency's stringent security standards exceed those of most federal divisions that are not part of national security. they say he inflated the severity of problems at the agency.

journalists at voice of america and some of pack's colleagues at the agency headquarters say he started with a desire to root out what he sees as anti-trump bias. and they say reporters are now finding themselves far more frequently second-guessed over coverage with political choices. the brief introduction of a piece about jill biden, which was broadcast a day after a similar piece on first lady melania trump, has prompted a formal review of french-to-africa service anchor salwa jaffari by usagm's human resources division.

on monday morning, a group of journalists at voice of america signed a letter of protest, saying pack was harming u.s. strategic interests and imperiling the lives of their colleagues who are foreign citizens by refusing to extend their work visas. that afternoon, the acting director, biberaj, issued a statement in response to his staffers' protest saying he valued a free press, the safety of his journalists and the firewall that protects their work.

on tuesday afternoon, usagm tweeted out a thread saying that the letter of protest was inappropriate and that it would therefore not respond. instead, it suggested those who signed could be subject to disciplinary response, calling it an ""administrative issue.""

several executives who left or were suspended by pack tell npr that the ceo openly broods over questions of loyalty and sidelined them because they were willing to push back against his instincts. turner described pack's outlook as ""paranoid.""

indeed, some of the people pack sidelined had joined the agency just months or even days before he did. his newly appointed top legal official, michael williams, left voluntarily, telling colleagues that he could not stomach the risks staffers who were not u.s. citizens could face without visas.

many of the people who were leading the agency when pack arrived already held sterling conservative credentials in washington: turner first joined the federal government under president george w. bush. powers had previously been an aide to republican sen. ted cruz of texas. jamie fly, the fired chief executive of radio free europe/radio liberty, had been an adviser to republican sen. marco rubio of florida. and two junior trump white house aides assigned earlier this year to usagm to help ease pack's transition in office were quickly exiled. they took up shop at cubicles abandoned by voice of america's spanish-language services so they could use a neglected foosball table, according to former usagm staffers.

none of those political ties seemed to matter.

disclosure: this story was reported by npr media correspondent david folkenflik and edited by npr media and technology editor emily kopp. because of npr ceo john lansing's prior role as ceo of the u.s. agency for global media, no senior news executive or corporate executive at npr reviewed this story before it was published."

Germany says nerve agent Novichok found in Russia’s Navalny,163,il7in0,https://apnews.com/96d8002d210d311fed1d6d4ba2a0534e,17,1599084731.0,,"file in this file photo taken on thursday, aug. 22, 2019, russian opposition leader alexei navalny speaks to the media prior to a court session in moscow, russia. german chancellor angela merkel says russian opposition leader alexei navalny was the victim of an ""attempted murder by poisoning"" and the aim was to silence him. navalny was poisoned with the same type of soviet-era nerve agent that british authorities identified in a 2018 attack on a former russian spy, the german government said wednesday, sept. 2, 2020 citing new test results.

(ap photo/alexander zemlianichenko, file)

berlin (ap) — russian opposition leader alexei navalny was poisoned with the same type of soviet-era nerve agent used in a 2018 attack on a former russian spy, the german government said wednesday, provoking outrage from western leaders who demanded moscow provide an explanation.

the findings — which experts say point strongly to russian state involvement — added to tensions between russia and the west. german chancellor angela merkel called navalny’s poisoning attempted murder, meant to silence one of russian president vladimir putin’s fiercest critics.

the berlin hospital treating the dissident said he remains on a ventilator though his condition is improving. it said it expects a long recovery and still can’t rule out long-term effects on his health from the poisoning.

the german government said that testing by a german military laboratory showed “proof without doubt of a chemical nerve agent from the novichok group.” british authorities identified novichok as the poison used on former spy sergei skripal and his daughter in england.

“there are very serious questions now that only the russian government can answer, and must answer,” merkel said.

the united kingdom and italy also called on russia to explain what happened, with british prime minister boris johnson calling the use of a chemical weapon “outrageous.” in washington, national security council spokesman john ullyot tweeted that it was “completely reprehensible.”

“we will work with allies and the international community to hold those in russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads,” ullyot said.

the european union’s foreign affairs chief, josep borrell, said any use of chemical weapons was “a breach of international law.”

navalny, a politician and corruption investigator, fell ill on a flight to moscow on aug. 20 and was taken to a hospital in the siberian city of omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.

he was moved two days later to berlin’s charite hospital, where doctors last week said initial tests indicated navalny had been poisoned.

german foreign minister heiko maas said the russian ambassador was summoned to his ministry wednesday after the latest findings.

russia’s deputy u.n. ambassador, dmitry polyansky, dismissed the finger pointing as a knee-jerk reaction. “today accusing #russia is a must-do for any western country,” he said in a tweet.

in moscow, russian authorities were quick to blame germany for not sharing its findings.

kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said russian authorities are “ready and interested in full cooperation and exchange of information” with germany but added that berlin still hasn’t provided any official response to formal requests from the russian prosecutor general’s office and doctors who treated navalny.

peskov reiterated that russian doctors didn’t find any poisonous substances in navalny’s system. russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova charged on state tv that germany preferred “public statements without providing any facts whatsoever” to “a thorough investigation.”

the german government said it would inform its partners in the european union and nato about the test results and would consult them on a response. germany also will contact the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons.

shortly after the test results were announced, the charite hospital said that navalny is still in intensive care but “continues to improve.”

“recovery is likely to be lengthy,” it said in a statement. “it is still too early to gauge the long-term effects, which may arise in relation to this severe poisoning.”

andrea sella, a professor of inorganic chemistry at university college london, said navalny’s prognosis is hard to predict. he said that “very swift action” is needed to stabilize patients in poisoning cases and noted the “significant delay,” given that navalny was initially cared for by russian doctors who said they had ruled out poisoning.

“the problem is that even if mr navalny were to survive there may be lingering long-term neurological issues,” sella said.

navalny’s allies in russia have insisted he was deliberately poisoned by the country’s authorities, accusations that the kremlin has rejected as “empty noise.”

“to poison navalny with novichok in 2020 would be exactly the same as leaving an autograph at a crime scene, like this one,” navalny’s longtime ally and strategist leonid volkov said in a tweet that featured a photo of putin’s name and a signature next to it.

it would not be the first time a prominent, outspoken russian was targeted in such a way — or the first time the kremlin was accused of being behind it.

navalny’s allies have also accused russian authorities of delaying his transfer out of the country after the poisoning. it took much wrangling and 48 hours to move navalny to berlin. local doctors at the time said he was too unstable to be transported, and the kremlin said it would defer to the physicians.

the siberian medical team relented only after a charity that had organized a medevac plane revealed that german doctors who examined the politician said he was stable enough to be moved.

the reversal came as international pressure on moscow mounted substantially.

“the system has long lost its ability to operate in an optimal way. it had to choose between the scandal related to navalny’s (possible) death in omsk and the risk of the poisoning being discovered by german doctors,” political analyst abbas gallyamov said.

novichok is a class of military-grade nerve agents developed by the soviet union at the end of the cold war. western weapons experts believe it was only ever manufactured in russia. after the skripals were poisoned, russia said the u.s., britain and other western countries had acquired the expertise to make the nerve agent and that the novichok used in that attack could have come from them.

several russian lawmakers have said russia isn’t manufacturing novichok-type agents.

“unless you are working for the military, it is impossible to be accidentally exposed,” richard parsons, a senior lecturer in biochemical toxicology at king’s college london, said. “it is unavailable from anywhere except the russian military as far as i am aware.”

britain charged two russians — alleged to be agents of the russian military intelligence service gru — in absentia with the 2018 attack that left the skripals in critical condition and killed a british woman. russia has refused to extradite the men to the u.k.

Health officials worry nation not ready for COVID-19 vaccine,0,il9n4p,https://apnews.com/0a6a5ad94e6bfe8e57b01737347b8040,2,1599091592.0,,"file - this march 16, 2020 file photo shows vials used by pharmacists to prepare syringes used on the first day of a first-stage safety study clinical trial of the potential vaccine for covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, in seattle. as the nation awaits a vaccine to end the pandemic, local health departments say they lack the staff, money and tools to distribute, administer and track millions of vaccines, most of which will require two doses.

(ap photo/ted s. warren, file)

public health departments, which have struggled for months to test and trace everyone exposed to the novel coronavirus, are now being told to prepare to distribute covid-19 vaccines as early as nov. 1.

in a four-page memo this summer, the federal centers for disease control and prevention told health departments across the country to draft vaccination plans by oct. 1 “to coincide with the earliest possible release of covid-19 vaccine.”

the cdc’s director, dr. robert redfield, also wrote to governors last week about the urgent need to have vaccine distribution sites up and running by nov. 1. redfield asked governors to expedite the process for setting up these facilities. mcclatchy first reported redfield’s letter.

but health departments that have been underfunded for decades say they currently lack the staff, money and tools to educate people about vaccines and then to distribute, administer and track doses to some 330 million people. nor do they know when, or if, they’ll get federal aid to do that.

“there is a tremendous amount of work to be done to be prepared for this vaccination program and it will not be complete by nov. 1,” said dr. kelly moore, associate director of immunization education at the immunization action coalition, a national vaccine education and advocacy organization based in st. paul, minnesota. “states will need more financial resources than they have now.”

dozens of doctors, nurses and health officials interviewed by kaiser health news and the associated press expressed concern about the country’s readiness to conduct mass vaccinations, as well as frustration with months of inconsistent information from the federal government.

the gaps include figuring out how officials will keep track of who has gotten which doses and how they’ll keep the workers who give the shots safe, with enough protective gear and syringes to do their jobs.

with only about half of americans saying they would get vaccinated, according to a poll from ap-norc center for public affairs research, it also will be crucial to educate people about the benefits of vaccination, said molly howell, who manages the north dakota department of health’s immunization program.

the unprecedented pace of vaccine development has left many americans skeptical about the safety of covid-19 immunizations; others simply don’t trust the federal government.

“we’re in a very deep-red state,” said ann lewis, ceo of caresouth carolina, a group of community health centers that serve mostly low-income people in five rural counties in south carolina. “the message that is coming out is not a message of trust and confidence in medical or scientific evidence.”

paying for the rollout

the u.s. has committed more than $10 billion to develop new coronavirus vaccines but hasn’t allocated money specifically for distributing and administering vaccines.

and while states, territories and 154 large cities and counties received billions in congressional emergency funding, that money can be used for a variety of purposes, including testing and overtime pay.

an ongoing investigation by khn and the ap has detailed how state and local public health departments across the u.s. have been starved for decades, leaving them underfunded and without adequate resources to confront the coronavirus pandemic. the investigation further found that federal coronavirus funds have been slow to reach public health departments, forcing some communities to cancel non-coronavirus vaccine clinics and other essential services.

states are allowed to use some of the federal money they’ve already received to prepare for immunizations. but ap and khn found that many health departments are so overwhelmed with the current costs of the pandemic — such as for testing and contact tracing — that they can’t reserve money for the vaccine work to come. health departments will need to hire people to administer the vaccines and systems to track them, and pay for supplies such as protective medical masks, gowns and gloves, as well as warehouses and refrigerator space.

full coverage: virus outbreak

caresouth carolina is collaborating with the state health department on testing and the pandemic response. it used federal funding to purchase $140,000 retrofitted vans for mobile testing, which it plans to continue to use to keep vaccines cold and deliver them to residents when the time comes, said lewis.

but most vaccine costs will be new.

pima county, arizona, for example, is already at least $30 million short of what health officials need to fight the pandemic, let alone plan for vaccines, said dr. francisco garcia, deputy county administrator and chief medical officer.

some federal funds will expire soon. the $150 billion that states and local governments received from a fund in the cares act, for example, covers only expenses made through the end of the year , said gretchen musicant, health commissioner in minneapolis. that’s a problem, given vaccine distribution may not have even begun.

although public health officials say they need more money, congress left washington for its summer recess without passing a new pandemic relief bill that would include additional funding for vaccine distribution.

“states are anxious to receive those funds as soon as possible, so they can do what they need to be prepared,” said moore of the immunization action coalition, a national vaccine education and advocacy organization based in st. paul, minnesota. “we can’t assume they can take existing funding and attempt the largest vaccination campaign in history.”

what’s the plan?

then there’s the basic question of scale. the federally funded vaccines for children program immunizes 40 million children each year . in 2009 and 2010, the cdc scaled up to vaccinate 81 million people against pandemic h1n1 influenza. and last winter, the country distributed 175 million vaccines for seasonal influenza vaccine , according to the cdc.

but for the u.s. to reach herd immunity against the coronavirus, most experts say, the nation would likely need to vaccinate roughly 70% of americans , which translates to 200 million people and — because the first vaccines will require two doses to be effective — 400 million shots.

although the cdc has overseen immunization campaigns in the past, the trump administration created a new program, called operation warp speed, to facilitate vaccine development and distribution. in august, the administration announced that mckesson corp. , which distributed h1n1 vaccines during that pandemic, will also distribute covid-19 vaccines to doctors’ offices and clinics.

“with few exceptions, our commercial distribution partners will be responsible for handling all the vaccines,” operation warp speed’s paul mango said in an email.

“we’re not going to have 300 million doses all at once,” said mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the health and human services department, despite earlier government pledges to have many doses ready by the new year. “we believe we are maximizing our probability of success of having tens of millions of doses of vaccines by january 2021, which is our goal.”

amesh adalja, a senior scholar at the johns hopkins center for health security, said it will take time for the vaccines to be widespread enough for life to return to what’s considered normal. “we have to be prepared to deal with this virus in the absence of significant vaccine-induced immunity for a period of maybe a year or longer,” adalja said in august.

in preliminary guidance for state vaccine managers, the cdc said doses will be distributed free of charge from a central location. health departments’ local vaccination plans may be reviewed by both the cdc and operation warp speed.

the cdc spent two days working with vaccine planners in five locations — north dakota, florida, california, minnesota and philadelphia — to discuss potential obstacles and solutions.

no actual vaccines were distributed during the planning sessions, which focused on how to get vaccines to people in places as different as urban philadelphia, where pharmacies abound, and rural north dakota, which has few chain drugstores but many clinics run by the federal indian health service, said kris ehresmann, who directs infectious disease control at the minnesota department of health.

those planning sessions have made ehresmann feel more confident about who’s in charge of distributing vaccines. “we are getting more specific guidance from cdc on planning now,” she said. “we feel better about the process, though there are still a lot of unknowns.”

outdated technology could hamper response

still, many public health departments will struggle to adequately track who has been vaccinated and when, because a lack of funding in recent decades has left them in the technological dark ages, said dr. marcus plescia, chief medical officer at the association of state and territorial health officials.

in mississippi, for example, health officials still rely on faxes, said the state’s health officer, dr. thomas dobbs. “you can’t manually handle 1,200 faxes a day and expect anything efficient to happen,″ he said.

when covid-19 vaccines become available, health providers will need to track where and when patients receive their vaccines, said moore, the medical director of tennessee’s immunization plan during the h1n1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and 2010. and with many different shots in the works, they will need to know exactly which one each patient got, she said.

people will need to receive their second covid-19 dose 21 or 28 days after the first, so health providers will need to remind patients to receive their second shot, moore said, and ensure that the second dose is the same brand as the first.

the cdc will require vaccinators to provide “ dose-level accounting and reporting” for immunizations, so that the agency knows where every dose of covid-19 vaccine is “at any point in time,” moore said. although “the sophistication of these systems has improved dramatically” in the past decade, she said, “many states will still face major challenges meeting data tracking and reporting expectations.”

the cdc is developing an app called the vaccine administration monitoring system for health departments whose data systems don’t meet standards for covid-19 response, said claire hannan, executive director of the association of immunization managers, a nonprofit based in rockville, maryland.

“those standards haven’t been released,” hannan said, “so health departments are waiting to invest in necessary it enhancements.″ the cdc needs to release standards and data expectations as quickly as possible, she added.

meanwhile, health departments are dealing with what minnesota’s ehresmann described as “legacy” vaccine registries, sometimes dating to the late 1980s.

a historic task

overwhelmed public health teams are already working long hours to test patients and trace their contacts, a time-consuming process that will need to continue even after vaccines become available.

when vaccines are ready, health departments will need more staffers to identify people at high risk for covid-19, who should get the vaccine first, moore said. public health staff also will be needed to educate the public about the importance of vaccines and to administer shots, she said, as well as monitor patients and report serious side effects.

at an august meeting about vaccine distribution, dr. ngozi ezike, director of illinois’ health department, said her state will need to recruit additional health professionals to administer the shots, including nursing students, medical students, dentists, dental hygienists and even veterinarians. such vaccinators will need medical-grade masks, gowns and gloves to keep themselves safe as they handle needles.

many health officials say they feel burned by the country’s struggle to provide hospitals with ventilators last spring, when states found themselves bidding against one another for a limited supply. those concerns are amplified by the continuing difficulties providing enough testing kits ; supplying health workers with personal protective equipment ; allocating drugs such as remdesivir ; and recruiting contact tracers — who track down everyone with whom people diagnosed with covid-19 have been in contact.

although ehresmann said she’s concerned minnesota could run out of syringes, she said the cdc has assured her it will provide them.

given that vaccines are far more complex than personal protective equipment and other medical supplies — one vaccine candidate must be stored at minus 94 degrees fahrenheit — plescia said people should be prepared for shortages, delays and mix-ups.

“it’s probably going to be even worse than the problems with testing and ppe,” plescia said.

DHS withheld July intelligence bulletin calling out Russian attack on Biden’s mental health,40,ilbgd7,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-withheld-july-intelligence-bulletin-calling-russian-attack/story?id=72747130,17,1599097121.0,,"dhs withheld july intelligence bulletin calling out russian attack on biden’s mental health the trump campaign has repeatedly engaged in a similar line of attack.

in early july the department of homeland security withheld publication of an intelligence bulletin warning law enforcement agencies of a russian scheme to promote “allegations about the poor mental health” of former vice president joe biden, according to internal emails and a draft of the document obtained by abc news.

the draft bulletin, titled “russia likely to denigrate health of us candidates to influence 2020 election,” was submitted to the agency’s legislative and public affairs office for review on july 7. the analysis was not meant for public consumption, but it was set to be distributed to federal, state and local law enforcement partners two days later, on july 9, the emails show.

just one hour after its submission, however, a senior dhs official intervened.

“please hold on sending this one out until you have a chance to speak to [acting secretary of homeland security chad wolf],"" wrote dhs chief of staff john gountanis, according to an email obtained by abc news.

that was nearly two months ago. but the bulletin was never circulated.

in a statement to abc news, a dhs spokesperson confirmed that the product was “delayed,” explaining that it failed to meet the agency’s standards.

according to the draft bulletin, analysts determined with “high confidence” that “russian malign influence actors are likely to continue denigrating presidential candidates through allegations of poor mental or physical health to influence the outcome of the 2020 election.”

“high confidence means what it sounds like -- that they are highly confident that their assessment is accurate and they don’t use that language very often,” elizabeth neumann, a former assistant secretary of homeland security during the trump administration, told abc news.

the document mentions iranian and chinese efforts to criticize trump, but focuses on — and takes its title from — russia’s attacks on biden’s mental fitness. it is a line of attack also utilized by both president donald trump and his reelection campaign.

beyond warnings of russia's purported activity, critics said the decision to withhold the document will fuel concern that the trump administration has sought to politicize intelligence, particularly after an announcement over the weekend that senior intelligence leaders will cease congressional election security briefings due to alleged leaks from lawmakers, and will instead provide only written reports.

“we are hearing concerns being raised publicly that, in this administration, intelligence community reporting is being modified or blocked for political reasons -- or to not anger the president,” said john cohen, an abc news contributor and the former undersecretary for intelligence at dhs under president barack obama.

“by blocking information from being released that describes threats facing the nation,” cohen continued, “it undermines the ability of the public and state and local authorities to work with the federal government to counteract the threat.”

as an example of russian efforts to raise doubts about biden's mental acuity, the draft bulletin points to a march story on a russian proxy website that ""refuted media claims that the candidate’s gaffes are a result of a stutter, instead arguing these verbal miscues are symptoms of dementia.”

the dhs spokesperson said that while the agency “generally does not comment on leaked documents, this particular draft product lacked the necessary context and evidence for broader dissemination outside of the department of homeland security’s office of intelligence and analysis.”

“after briefing the acting secretary and he asked questions,” the spokesperson continued, “[office of intelligence and analysis] career leadership decided to delay the product for further review.”

in a statement to abc news regarding the dhs bulletin, trump campaign spokesperson tim murtaugh said, “we don’t need or want any foreign interference.”

“there’s no question that the president has been tougher on russia than any president before him, imposing sanctions and expelling diplomats, in contrast to the obama-biden administration, which choked in the face of russian interference,” he said. “president trump will beat joe biden fair and square.”

the white house declined to comment.

biden camp accuses trump of 'speaking from the same script' as russia

the trump campaign’s effort to depict biden, who turns 78 shortly after election day, as mentally unfit for office has emerged as a central tenet of its multi-million dollar strategy to paint biden as a feeble puppet of the “radical left.”

it dates back to 2018 when, at the annual gridiron club dinner, trump jabbed his future 2020 opponent: “there's talk about joe biden, sleepy joe, getting into the race … the guy who keeps making outrageous statements thinks he has a shot at being president?”

and while trump, himself 74, first tweeted the “sleepy joe” nickname in april of last year, he and his campaign increased attacks on the former vice president's mental state earlier this spring as biden emerged as the presumptive democratic nominee. trump repeatedly targeted biden in remarks and on twitter while his campaign in may launched a facebook ad blitz that raised questions about his ""geriatric mental health.""

in june the trump campaign ran a brutal television ad titled ""fortitude"" that worked to paint a dire picture of biden’s mental state.

the next month -- around the time the dhs memo was submitted -- trump said in a radio interview, ""[biden's] record is terrible. he can't even talk about his record. he forgets his record, he forgets everything.""

on tuesday, the president said, ""biden doesn't know he's alive.""

in a statement to abc news, andrew bates, a spokesperson for the biden campaign, decried “the lengths to which donald trump will go to manipulate and conceal intelligence for partisan political purposes.”

“he is blocking the intelligence community from sharing with federal and state law enforcement a crucial finding: that russia is disseminating false and scurrilous attacks on the health of joe biden -- one that aligns with trump's own constantly-backfiring attacks,” bates added. “and why would he do this? because russia and the trump campaign are speaking from the same script of smears and lies.”

in the intelligence draft bulletin, analysts point out that russia’s current line of attack targeting biden’s health echoes its efforts in 2016 to “[raise] serious doubts about [then-candidate hillary clinton’s] physical capability,” particularly after she fell ill at a 9/11 memorial event in new york city.

at the time, trump and his surrogates leveled similar attacks against clinton, calling into question her physical fitness for office. weeks after the 9/11 memorial incident, trump said during a debate that clinton “doesn't have the stamina” to be president.

intel chief’s move to limit congressional briefings sparks outcry

after months of warnings from law enforcement and the intelligence community of moscow’s ongoing efforts to meddle in the november election, if it had been circulated, the july bulletin would have served as one of the most explicit and specific examples to date of russia’s intentions.

in august, the office of director of national intelligence publicly reported “that russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate” biden, adding that “some kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost president trump’s candidacy on social media and russian television.”

trump later disputed that finding, claiming that “the last person russia wants to see in office is donald trump, because nobody’s been tougher on russia than i have, ever.”

on saturday, the office of the director of national intelligence (odni) announced it would halt in-person congressional briefings about election security, citing concern over ""unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information.""

newly minted director of national intelligence john ratcliffe wrote to congressional leaders that ""this approach helps ensure… that the information odni provides the congress … is not misunderstood nor politicized.""

democrats fired back, calling ratcliffe’s decision “a shocking abdication of its lawful responsibility to keep the congress currently informed, and a betrayal of the public's right to know how foreign powers are trying to subvert our democracy.”

acting homeland security secretary chad wolf reacted sunday on abc news’ “this week,” saying his agency will “continue to have in-person briefings with members of congress and staff,” but defended ratcliffe’s decision.

in their statement to abc news, the dhs spokesperson added that “[the dhs office of intelligence and analysis] is committed to fulfilling its mission to keep the homeland safe and secure, which included the sharing of three reports on election security in august 2020 with state and local partners.”

on “this week,” wolf added that russia, china, and iran continue to engage in “disinformation campaigns to sow discourse within the u.s.”

in the august statement from odni, intelligence officials concluded that “china prefers that president trump – whom beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection.” iran, it found, “seeks to undermine u.s. democratic institutions, president trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections.”

in the july draft bulletin, in addition to reports of russian interference, analysts said iranian state media has “amplified public discussion by medical professionals alleging that [president trump] suffered from psychosis and narcissistic personality disorder.” in china, state media outlets have “questioned [president trump’s] health and suggested that a debate about the mental health of a u.s. president is indicative of deeper problems with democracy.”

with just two months until ballots are tallied, cohen said the safety and efficacy of our election depend on collaboration within the law enforcement community and transparency about malign foreign meddling.

“one of the ways you counteract these threats,” cohen said, “is by providing state and local authorities, political parties, and the general public access to information about both the methods being used to spread this disinformation and the contents of this disinformation campaign so people know, when they see this material, that it is inaccurate and is to be disregarded.”

Owner of burned business accuses Trump of misleading public,60,ilenv6,https://apnews.com/2a85b07d4bb9e7d8abcdcafbaa912076,47,1599106642.0,,"kenosha, wis. (ap) — a curfew that was in place in kenosha for more than a week after the police shooting of jacob blake was lifted wednesday, another sign of increasing calm in the southeastern wisconsin city that has been the epicenter of the latest eruption over racial injustice.

the move came a day after the curfew was targeted as unconstitutional in a federal lawsuit and the day before former vice president joe biden planned to visit, marking his first campaign stop in wisconsin in nearly two years.

the curfew was enacted after blake, a black man, was shot by a police officer on aug. 23. jacob blake sr. on wednesday told wgn america’s “newsnation” that his son is out of a hospital intensive care unit.

the shooting of blake, captured on cellphone video, sparked protests that resulted in buildings being burned and vandalized and in the shootings of three demonstrators, two of whom died. seventeen-year-old kyle rittenhouse has been charged in the aug. 25 slayings; his attorney says it was self defense.

biden said wednesday that the officer who shot blake should be charged, a sharp contrast to trump’s support-the-police message when he visited kenosha a day earlier. the president met with law enforcement, toured some of the damage and called the violence “domestic terrorism,” and made almost no mention of blake.

biden also plans to meet with members of blake’s family, something trump did not do, and hold a community meeting.

protests have been peaceful for more than a week, other than a few minor skirmishes during trump’s visit.

“the last several nights have been relatively peaceful in the community, and in the judgment of law enforcement, it is appropriate to remove the curfew,” mayor john antaramian said. however, he held out the possibility that the curfew may return, saying “criminal activity will not be tolerated.”

the about-face came after four people who were arrested during the protests filed a federal lawsuit alleging that local law enforcement arrested only those protesting against police brutality, not “pro-police protesters and militia” who were armed with rifles.

“in kenosha, there are two sets of laws — one that applies to those who protest police brutality and racism, and another for those who support the police,” the lawsuit said.

sam hall, attorney for kenosha county, said the county will seek immediate dismissal. he said the sheriff’s department “has worked tirelessly to bring order back to the community and has been careful to protect the rights of all citizens throughout that process.”

north carolina civil rights lawyer kimberly motely, who is representing those arrested, said she thought the lawsuit “definitely played a role” in the decision to lift the curfew. there are no immediate plans to drop the suit, which also seeks damages for those arrested, motley said. she also represents gaige grosskreutz, who prosecutors say was shot in the arm by rittenhouse.

rittenhouse’s attorney john pierce tweeted a video of him tuesday speaking by phone with rittenhouse from jail in illinois, where he was arrested.

“i just want to thank every single one of you from the bottom of my heart for the underlining support, it’s just amazing,” rittenhouse said from the phone held up by pierce. “i want to thank all of you for the mail i’ve been receiving. it’s been really helpful. i just want to let you all know that i’m going to be out of here soon and stay strong. and i hope to see you guys soon.”

on monday, trump defended rittenhouse. buzzfeed news, citing since deleted social media, reported that rittenhouse sat in the front row at a trump rally in des moines in january and a tiktok bio page of his included the slogan “trump 2020.”

during his visit to kenosha, trump highlighted a camera shop that was destroyed during protests. but the shop’s owner, tom gram, said the president used his store for political gain by appearing with a former owner of the business.

gram said he bought rode’s camera shop from the rode family eight years ago, though john rode still owns the property. gram said he rejected an offer to join the president on his tour, and that trump’s references to rode as the owner of the business were deceptive.

“i think everything he (trump) does turns into a circus and i just didn’t want to be involved in it,” gram told milwaukee station wtmj-tv.

the white house noted wednesday that rode and his family founded and built rode’s camera shop before world war ii and still own the building that houses the shop. trump didn’t visit the site of the shop, but rode met with him a few blocks away and appeared at a roundtable later in the day.

“i just appreciate president trump coming today, everybody here does,” rode said. “we’re so thankful we got the federal troops here. once they got here things did calm down quite a bit.”

“a day earlier we would have saved your store,” trump responded. “one day earlier.”

wisconsin gov. tony evers deployed the national guard to kenosha to quell demonstrations. trump has sought to take credit , although evers activated them a day before trump demanded they be used.

berlin (ap) — russian opposition leader alexei navalny was poisoned with the same type of soviet-era nerve agent used in a 2018 attack on a former russian spy, the german government said wednesday, provoking outrage from western leaders who demanded moscow provide an explanation.

the findings — which experts say point strongly to russian state involvement — added to tensions between russia and the west. german chancellor angela merkel called navalny’s poisoning attempted murder, meant to silence one of russian president vladimir putin’s fiercest critics.

the berlin hospital treating the dissident said he remains on a ventilator though his condition is improving. it said it expects a long recovery and still can’t rule out long-term effects on his health from the poisoning.

the german government said that testing by a german military laboratory showed “proof without doubt of a chemical nerve agent from the novichok group.” british authorities identified novichok as the poison used on former spy sergei skripal and his daughter in england.

“there are very serious questions now that only the russian government can answer, and must answer,” merkel said.

the united kingdom and italy also called on russia to explain what happened, with british prime minister boris johnson calling the use of a chemical weapon “outrageous.” in washington, national security council spokesman john ullyot tweeted that it was “completely reprehensible.”

“we will work with allies and the international community to hold those in russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads,” ullyot said.

the european union’s foreign affairs chief, josep borrell, said any use of chemical weapons was “a breach of international law.”

navalny, a politician and corruption investigator, fell ill on a flight to moscow on aug. 20 and was taken to a hospital in the siberian city of omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.

he was moved two days later to berlin’s charite hospital, where doctors last week said initial tests indicated navalny had been poisoned.

german foreign minister heiko maas said the russian ambassador was summoned to his ministry wednesday after the latest findings.

russia’s deputy u.n. ambassador, dmitry polyansky, dismissed the finger pointing as a knee-jerk reaction. “today accusing #russia is a must-do for any western country,” he said in a tweet.

in moscow, russian authorities were quick to blame germany for not sharing its findings.

kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said russian authorities are “ready and interested in full cooperation and exchange of information” with germany but added that berlin still hasn’t provided any official response to formal requests from the russian prosecutor general’s office and doctors who treated navalny.

peskov reiterated that russian doctors didn’t find any poisonous substances in navalny’s system. russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova charged on state tv that germany preferred “public statements without providing any facts whatsoever” to “a thorough investigation.”

the german government said it would inform its partners in the european union and nato about the test results and would consult them on a response. germany also will contact the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons.

shortly after the test results were announced, the charite hospital said that navalny is still in intensive care but “continues to improve.”

“recovery is likely to be lengthy,” it said in a statement. “it is still too early to gauge the long-term effects, which may arise in relation to this severe poisoning.”

andrea sella, a professor of inorganic chemistry at university college london, said navalny’s prognosis is hard to predict. he said that “very swift action” is needed to stabilize patients in poisoning cases and noted the “significant delay,” given that navalny was initially cared for by russian doctors who said they had ruled out poisoning.

“the problem is that even if mr navalny were to survive there may be lingering long-term neurological issues,” sella said.

navalny’s allies in russia have insisted he was deliberately poisoned by the country’s authorities, accusations that the kremlin has rejected as “empty noise.”

“to poison navalny with novichok in 2020 would be exactly the same as leaving an autograph at a crime scene, like this one,” navalny’s longtime ally and strategist leonid volkov said in a tweet that featured a photo of putin’s name and a signature next to it.

it would not be the first time a prominent, outspoken russian was targeted in such a way — or the first time the kremlin was accused of being behind it.

navalny’s allies have also accused russian authorities of delaying his transfer out of the country after the poisoning. it took much wrangling and 48 hours to move navalny to berlin. local doctors at the time said he was too unstable to be transported, and the kremlin said it would defer to the physicians.

the siberian medical team relented only after a charity that had organized a medevac plane revealed that german doctors who examined the politician said he was stable enough to be moved.

the reversal came as international pressure on moscow mounted substantially.

“the system has long lost its ability to operate in an optimal way. it had to choose between the scandal related to navalny’s (possible) death in omsk and the risk of the poisoning being discovered by german doctors,” political analyst abbas gallyamov said.

novichok is a class of military-grade nerve agents developed by the soviet union at the end of the cold war. western weapons experts believe it was only ever manufactured in russia. after the skripals were poisoned, russia said the u.s., britain and other western countries had acquired the expertise to make the nerve agent and that the novichok used in that attack could have come from them.

several russian lawmakers have said russia isn’t manufacturing novichok-type agents.

“unless you are working for the military, it is impossible to be accidentally exposed,” richard parsons, a senior lecturer in biochemical toxicology at king’s college london, said. “it is unavailable from anywhere except the russian military as far as i am aware.”

britain charged two russians — alleged to be agents of the russian military intelligence service gru — in absentia with the 2018 attack that left the skripals in critical condition and killed a british woman. russia has refused to extradite the men to the u.k.

"Duped by Russia, freelancers ensnared in disinformation campaign by promise of easy money",5,ilgw6c,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook-russia/duped-by-russia-freelancers-ensnared-in-disinformation-campaign-by-promise-of-easy-money-idUSKBN25T35E,2,1599113743.0,,"london (reuters) - when freelance journalist laura walters submitted a 1,000 word article about chinese political influence in new zealand to her new editors at non-profit media outlet peace data, the response was emphatic.

freelance journalist laura walters is pictured near her home after speaking to reuters about working unknowingly for a fake news outlet which facebook says was part of a russian disinformation campaign, in london, britain, september 2, 2020. reuters/toby melville

“i’d like to express our deep gratitude for your work,” wrote peace data communications manager alice schultz in a june 15 email seen by reuters. “it’s hard to believe how totalitarian countries like china (or russia) are finding their ways to meddle even in the strongest democracies around the globe.”

but that email, from a person claiming to be schultz, now appears to have been a small part of one such meddling attempt.

acting on a tip from the fbi, facebook and twitter said on tuesday they had identified peace data as the center of a russian political influence campaign targeting left-wing voters in the united states, britain and other countries.

the website succeeded in tricking and hiring freelance journalists to write articles about topics including the u.s. presidential election, the coronavirus pandemic and alleged western war crimes, facebook said.

email correspondence reviewed by reuters and interviews with six journalists commissioned by the website show how the writers were approached on social media, paid up to $250 per article and some times encouraged to insert political angles into their work.

a person who identified themselves as bernadett plaschil, an associate editor at peace data, told reuters via email: “we’re really confused by these accusations and deny all of them.” the person declined to speak via phone or video call.

the news about peace data follows warnings that russia is attempting to sway the outcome of november’s election after what u.s. intelligence officials have said was a concerted effort to boost the campaign of president donald trump in 2016.

russia has repeatedly denied those allegations and the kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment about peace data on wednesday.

“i actually referenced the russian 2016 interference in the article i wrote,” uk-based walters, who was paid $250 to write the story for peace data in june, told reuters. “i appreciate the irony right now.”

old school tactics

peace data “staff” approached walters and other authors online, usually in private messages on twitter or business networking site linkedin. they offered between $100 to $250 for an article and paid promptly via internet money transfers, the writers said.

all of the writers contacted by reuters, some of whom requested anonymity due to fears of professional repercussions, said they had no knowledge about the website’s russian backing before tuesday.

some of the journalists said they viewed the work as an easy way to earn money during the coronavirus outbreak. others were aspiring reporters looking for a break. “my first published article on an independent news source,” one of the writers said when posting their work on social media in may.

while some of the authors said there was no overt political direction from the peace data staff, others said the website’s editorial line made them uncomfortable.

“there was an over-stated political angle put into my stories,” said one journalist who wrote for peace data about turkey and the case of wikileaks founder julian assange.

“it rapidly stopped being a news article as they kept asking for more focus on political topics with a particular spin,” the person added.

russia’s use of fake organizations to ensnare unwitting agents and activists as part of its propaganda efforts dates back to the soviet union, said thomas rid, a professor at john hopkins university and author of active measures, a book about political warfare.

as efforts to catch online influence operations have increased since 2016, “defaulting back to some of the old school tactics appears to be what they are doing to try to stay hidden,” he said.

walters said her experiences showed the importance of improving public awareness about efforts to deceive people online.

“the level of sophistication, the effort that’s gone into it... they obviously think it’s worth it and it’s going to amount to something,” she said.

“so i feel like if i can be fooled by something like this, anyone could be,” she added. “but it’s probably the most interesting thing that’s going to happen to me for a very long time.”

"Pelosi calls private hair salon visit in San Francisco, against local regulations, 'clearly a setup'",1,ilhx68,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pelosi-calls-private-hair-salon-visit-san-francisco/story?id=72770701&cid=clicksource_4380645_1_heads_hero_live_twopack_hed,12,1599117317.0,[deleted],"pelosi calls private hair salon visit in san francisco, against local regulations, 'clearly a setup' pelosi's office says she was complying with the rules the salon presented.

house speaker nancy pelosi's stylist is backing her claim that her private visit to a san francisco hair salon on monday, in which she received styling indoors despite a city-wide ban on indoor styling, was ultimately ""a setup.""

he has disputed the account of the salon's owner who appeared wednesday night on fox news as the white house and republicans continued to attack pelosi, following the lead of president donald trump.

abc news has reached out to the salon owner for comment.

in a press conference wednesday in san francisco on coronavirus legislation, pelosi claimed she was misled by the neighborhood salon who had approved of her visit in advance. leaked security footage from the appointment showed her at one point wearing a mask around her neck instead of over her face.

""i take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that i've been to, over the years, many times, and that when they said what we're able to accommodate people one person at a time, and that we can set up that time, i trusted that. as it turns out, that was the setup."" pelosi told reporters. ""so, i take responsibility for falling for a setup. and that's all i'm going to say on that.""

""i think that this salon owes me an apology, for setting me up,"" she added later.

white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany on thursday said it's pelosi who should be apologizing to the american people.

""she's demanding an apology from this salon owner, a single mom who started a business?"" mcenany asked rhetorically in an interview on fox news. ""no, she owes an apology to the american people. she is so breathtakingly out of touch. that video and her response to that video exposes that.""

pelosi's stylist jonathan denardo in a statement late wednesday through his lawyer, obtained by abc news, that despite the salon's owner, erica kious, suggesting she had no control of the event, she approved the appointment the night before over the phone and made disparaging comments about the speaker.

""the fact that ms. kious is now objecting to speaker pelosi's presence at esalon, and from a simple surface-level review of ms. kious' political leanings, it appears ms. kious is furthering a set-up of speaker pelosi for her own vain aspirations,"" the statement from matthew soleimanpour read. ""mr. denardo's name has now been dragged through the mud for simply following ms. kious' recommendations.""

the stylist's lawyer goes on to claim that kious has been violating the health order herself by operating in the salon as far back as april and without taking coronavirus precautions.

kious told fox news host tucker carlson on wednesday night before denardo's statement was released that the accusation that she set the speaker up was ""absolutely false.""

asked how she was set up on wednesday, pelosi bristled, asking reporters in turn, ""do you have any questions about how people are dying?""

""there's more to this that i'm not going into as to the motivation of a salon to say to me, 'yes come in' ... it was clearly a set up. i take responsibility for falling for a setup,"" she said. ""i take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that i've been to for years.""

earlier, pelosi's office, citing guidance provided to her from the salon, denied she broke their rules, but the president called pelosi out for having a mask under her chin in the now widely-circulated video footage.

""crazy nancy pelosi is being decimated for having a beauty parlor opened, when all others are closed, and for not wearing a mask - despite constantly lecturing everyone else,"" trump said in a tweet wednesday morning.

suggesting the event will harm democrats in the house, the president added, ""we will almost certainly take back the house, and send nancy packing!""

in security video fox news said it obtained, pelosi is seen walking through the esalon in san francisco on monday afternoon with wet hair and with a mask at her neck instead of over her mouth and nose. her stylist, denardo, is seen following her wearing a black face mask. it was unclear from the video whether she had the mask on her face during the rest of the appointment.

""i just had my hair washed. i don't wear a mask when i'm washing my hair. do you wear a mask when you're washing your hair? i always wear a mask,"" pelosi said wednesday when asked. ""and that picture is when i just came out of the bowl.""

pelosi spokesman drew hammill said tuesday night the speaker followed requirements provided by her stylist and was told the city allowed the salon to have one customer in the business at a time.

""the speaker always wears a mask and complies with local covid requirements. this business offered for the speaker to come in on monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business. the speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment,"" he said in a statement.

but on tuesday night, kios told fox news in a phone interview that the indoor, unmasked visit violated citywide covid-19 restrictions prohibiting indoor services and blow-drying services at hair salons and was a ""slap in the face"" to those who can't work or go about their daily lives due to the pandemic.

she said that pelosi's stylist rents a chair in her salon but operates independently -- a statement the stylist's lawyer later challenged by claiming kious has been encouraging her employees to break the orders for financial benefit.

a statement from the san francisco mayor's office posted friday states that outdoor services at hair salons -- which have been closed since march -- could resume tuesday -- a day after pelosi's appointment -- but added that ""services may not be provided indoors"" and masks must be worn.

""outdoor personal services that can operate include haircuts, barber services, massages and nail services. only those services where both clients and providers can be masked at all times are allowed to resume,"" it reads.

the new guidance which took effect september 1 also states shampooing is not allowed and that stylists must not see multiple customers at once.

white house chief of staff mark meadows also weighed in wednesday morning, calling pelosi's visit an example of washington hypocrisy.

""this is typical washington, d.c. they get on national tv. they preach to the american people that it should be one way and, yet, in private, when the cameras are not rolling and in this case i guess the cameras were rolling, it shows a very different story,"" meadows told fox news. ""it's the same thing whether it's in san francisco with her going into a salon or in the privacy of a negotiating room.""

on tuesday evening, a twitter account operated by senate republicans appeared to quote kious, also called pelosi's visit a ""slap in the face"" to business owners forced to close to slow the spread of covid-19.

""speaker pelosi has pushed policies that would keep our economy closed and our small businesses shut down. but for herself? a salon visit whenever she pleases,"" the senate republicans account tweeted, adding: ""a 'slap in the face' indeed.""

Trump encourages North Carolina residents to vote twice to test mail-in system,87,ilicps,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-encourages-north-carolina-residents-vote-twice-test-mail-system-n1239140,70,1599118876.0,,"washington — president donald trump suggested that people in north carolina should vote twice in the november election, once by mail and once in person, escalating his attempts to cast confusion and doubt on the validity of the results.

""so let them send it in and let them go vote, and if their system's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote. if it isn't tabulated, they'll be able to vote,"" trump said when asked whether he has confidence in the mail-in system in north carolina, a battleground state.

""if it's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote. if it isn't tabulated, they'll be able to vote. so that's the way it is. and that's what they should do,"" he said.

it is illegal to vote more than once in an election.

trump has made countless false statements about the security of voting by mail ahead of the election as much of the country braces for an increase of voters who opt for mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic.

the trump campaign and the republican national committee have sued states that have moved to expand access to mail-in voting in response to the pandemic, including nevada, new jersey and montana.

""president trump encourages supporters to vote absentee-by-mail early, and then show up in person at the polls or the local registrar to verify that their vote has already been counted,"" trump campaign official tim murtaugh said. ""it’s amazing that the media can go from insisting that voter fraud doesn’t exist to screaming about it when president trump points out the giant holes in the democrats’ voting schemes.”

despite trump's claims that mail-in ballots lead to widespread fraud that benefits democrats, there is no clear evidence that suggests that either party gains an advantage with mail-in voting.

trump and his wife, melania trump, requested absentee ballots to vote in the florida primary this year.

a washington post analysis estimates that at least 83 percent of americans are eligible to vote by mail this fall.

""i don't like that,"" trump responded when a reporter told him that 600,000 voters in north carolina could vote absentee.

asked about trump's comments during an interview later wednesday on cnn, attorney general william barr argued that a 2005 bipartisan report on election reform found that mail-in voting is ""fraught with the risk of fraud and coercion.""

asked why there have been no findings, however, of widespread fraud, barr responded, ""we haven't had the kind of widespread use of mail-in ballots that's being proposed.""

barr said he was unaware of the specific laws in north carolina, and he did not respond directly to questions about trump's earlier comments.

trump made similar claims about mail-in ballots during his 2016 campaign, essentially encouraging his supporters to commit voter fraud.

at a rally in colorado just days before he was elected, trump told supporters to obtain new ballots because ""do you think those [mail-in] ballots are properly counted?"""
"With a hand from Trump, the right makes Rittenhouse a cause célèbre",0,ilixe5,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/01/trump-rittenhouse-kenosha-support-407106,3,1599120942.0,,"alan endries was among them. when asked what spurred him to make the 40-mile drive from milwaukee for president donald trump’s visit to kenosha on tuesday, he said he felt empathy for rittenhouse. “i just feel bad for that 17-year-old.”

“he’s a hero. he stuck up for the population, for property owners,” endries said. “he didn’t come up here just to shoot people. he came up here to defend himself.”

the defense of rittenhouse by trump backers reflects the chasm that’s opened across the nation in the wake of deadly violence in kenosha and portland, ore. activists on the left rushed to defend jacob blake, a black man shot seven times in the back by a white police officer, launching a series of demonstrations protesting what they call systemic racism by police.

but many people on the right see a different dominant narrative from kenosha: a teen who was wrongly charged with homicide and should be lionized. online crowdfunding petitions have sprouted, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of rittenhouse. and he's gotten a hand from the president himself, who refused this week to denounce the teen’s actions.

the divisions were on full display tuesday in wisconsin, one of the most pivotal swing states in the country. during trump’s visit, his supporters and black lives matter activists clashed in the street along the main government complex near downtown, trading chants of “all lives matter” and “black lives matter.”

blm activists held signs and voiced support for blake, whose shooting prompted both peaceful protests and destructive riots. meantime, more than a dozen trump supporters interviewed tuesday questioned the case against rittenhouse, accusing the media of clouding the facts in the case.

rittenhouse, wielding a military-style weapon that he could not legally carry at his age, shot three protesters, killing two of them. his attorney has said rittenhouse acted in self-defense.

rittenhouse was charged as an adult with six criminal counts, including two counts of first-degree murder, for shootings that killed two men, joseph rosenbaum, 36, and anthony huber, 26, and injured a third. in videos of the incidents, rittenhouse was pursued before he fired his weapon. the criminal complaint filed against rittenhouse states rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at him. the footage also shows huber trying to hit rittenhouse before he was shot in the chest, perforating his heart, aorta, pulmonary artery and right lung, according to authorities.

“you shouldn’t put a gun in a child’s hand,” shawn lyons, a trump supporter from nearby burlington, said. “but it was self-defense, definitely. i think we could have avoided the whole thing if we had the national guard protecting kenosha at the time instead of children wondering how their family’s business is going to do it with all the mobs.”

“free him. free kyle,” said another man who said he was a kenosha resident but declined to provide his full name. “he was here to protect us.”

his friend agreed. “he’s a patriot, he was protecting people,"" said the man, who also declined to give his name. ""the people out there are trying to make him look bad. he shot some people — that’s bad. he killed two people, that’s bad, i understand that. but that’s our right as american people, to protect ourselves, right?”

rittenhouse’s interactions with police have drawn scrutiny, particularly when compared with the swift reactions of officers to black suspects.

j.a. moore, a biden supporter and south carolina lawmaker whose sister was one of nine black congregants killed at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston in 2015, recalled how officers brought fast food to the shooter, dylann roof. moore and others compared that with kenosha police providing water to rittenhouse and thanking his armed group just before the shooting last week."

former vice president joe biden on wednesday said he has begun preparing for the upcoming debates between him and president donald trump, specifically by brushing up on trump’s “multiple lies,” and proposed a “crawler” on tv screens to fact check.

key facts

biden was asked during an event on reopening schools in wilmington, delaware, if anything could dissuade him from participating in the debates after house speaker nancy pelosi suggested last week that he withdraw to avoid “legitimizing a conversation” with trump. “i’m looking forward to the debates,” biden said, adding that what would make it a “great, great debate” is if everything both candidates said was “instantly fact-checked by an agreed-to group of people” using a “crawler” on tv screens. biden conceded the idea “probably wouldn’t get very far.” the subject of trump’s mistruths came up again when biden asked how he was spending his $364.5 million haul, which he said is being used to “counter the lies that are being told,” by “trump’s campaign and the swift boaters out there, the new pac.” biden also clarified remarks he made in august about a possible national mask mandate, noting that he doesn’t know whether an executive order would be constitutional and that he would instead “put pressure” on state and local officials, as well as business owners, to require masks. biden also weighed in on trump’s surprise visit to walter reed in november – which the president denied was due to a “series of mini-strokes” – saying that while he’s “not gonna speculate,” it serves an example of how “nothing this administration does is normal.”

crucial quote

biden harshly criticized trump in his remarks, particularly over his handling of the pandemic. ""if president trump and his administration had done their jobs early on in this crisis, american schools would be open and they'd be open safely,” biden asserted, also accusing trump of “inciting violence in our streets” and telling him to “get off twitter.”

chief critic

the trump campaign took aim at biden for rarely fielding questions from reporters. “this makes two press conferences in a row where joe biden took questions from a pre-selected list of reporters—the last one being 36 days ago,” tweeted trump campaign rapid response staffer jake schneider. gop rapid response director steve guest noted that one reporter told biden “we don’t see you that often.”

what to watch for

the commission on presidential debates on wednesday announced the moderators for the three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate in the run up to november. fox news host chris wallace will moderate the first debate on sept. 29 in cleveland, ohio, c-span political editor steve scully will moderate the second on oct. 15 in miami, florida, and nbc news white house correspondent kristen welker will moderate the third on oct. 22 in nashville, tennessee. the vice presidential debate will take place on oct. 7 in salt lake city, utah, and will be moderated by usa today washington bureau chief susan page."

providence, r.i. (ap) — the federal government has told states to prepare for a coronavirus vaccine to be ready to distribute by nov. 1.

the timeline raised concern among public health experts about an “october surprise” — a vaccine approval driven by political considerations ahead of a presidential election, rather than science.

in a letter to governors dated aug. 27, robert redfield, director of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, said states “in the near future” will receive permit applications from mckesson corp., which has contracted with cdc to distribute vaccines to places including state and local health departments and hospitals.

“cdc urgently requests your assistance in expediting applications for these distribution facilities and, if necessary, asks that you consider waiving requirements that would prevent these facilities from becoming fully operational by november 1, 2020,” redfield wrote.

he wrote that any waivers will not compromise the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine. the associated press obtained the letter, which was first reported by mcclatchy.

the cdc also sent three planning documents to some health departments that included possible timelines for when vaccines would be available. the documents are to be used to develop plans for early vaccination when the supply might be constrained, according to one of the documents, which outlined a scenario in which a vaccine could be available as soon as the end of october.

“the covid-19 vaccine landscape is evolving and uncertain, and these scenarios may evolve as more information is available,” the document reads.

another of the documents says that limited covid-19 vaccine doses may be available by early november and that supply will increase substantially in 2021.

it also states that initially available vaccines will either be approved by the food and drug administration or authorized by the agency under its emergency powers.

the documents encourage health officials to work out now which groups to prioritize for a vaccine, identify providers who will administer vaccine, and take other steps to prepare. the planning documents were first reported by the new york times.

redfield told yahoo finance that officials were preparing “for what i anticipate will be reality, is that there’ll be one or more vaccines available for us in november, december.”

james s. blumenstock, a senior vice president at the association of state and territorial health officials, said the cdc was offering “an aggressive but necessary timetable” and that public health agencies were mobilizing to prepare detailed plans.

several public health experts pointed out that final stage trials of experimental vaccines are still recruiting, and are at best halfway through that process. the vaccines are two doses, and each is given a month apart. the experts told the ap they did not understand how there could be adequate data on whether the vaccines work and are safe before nov. 1.

“being ready is reasonable. cutting short phase 3 trials before you get the information you need isn’t,” said dr. paul offit, a children’s hospital of philadelphia immunization expert who sits on the fda’s vaccine advisory committee.

peter hotez, dean of baylor university’s tropical medicine school, said he was “very concerned” about whether the fda would use an emergency use authorization to approve a vaccine before knowing whether it works and is safe.

“it gives the appearance of a stunt rather than an expression of public health concern,″ hotez said.

fda commissioner stephen hahn previously said the agency wouldn’t cut corners in evaluating vaccines, though it would aim to expedite its work. he told the financial times this week that it might be “appropriate” to approve a vaccine before clinical trials were complete if the benefits outweighed the risks.

unlike a therapeutic that is given to sick people who may have no alternative, a vaccine is given to healthy people, “so you have a much higher burden of proof,” said ashish jha, dean of brown university’s public health school.

“i think it’s reasonable to be communicating to hospitals and saying — at some point late in the fall or winter,” jha said. “november feels awfully early.”

michael osterholm, a university of minnesota infectious disease expert, said he was concerned about an “october surprise” with a vaccine being rushed through ahead of the election.

“the public health community wants a safe and effective vaccine as much as anybody could want it,” osterholm said. “but the data have to be clear and compelling.”

he said there was a “credibility gap” between doctors and the fda about how rigorously products are being evaluated during the pandemic.

some state officials said wednesday that they were working on next steps while still awaiting details from cdc, and some sounded a cautious note.

kris ehresmann, minnesota’s infectious disease director, told the ap the state would only move forward “once we know it is safe.” she said they would take their lead from the cdc’s advisory committee on immunization practices, which she said “will only recommend a vaccine that has met the safety criteria.”

the oregon board of pharmacy said it would expedite mckesson’s applications but wouldn’t waive requirements necessary to maintain public health and safety. its executive director, joe schnabel, said in a statement that the board didn’t have enough information on how distribution would work “to speculate about whether it will be fully operational by november 1st.”

the office of pennsylvania gov. tom wolf, a democrat, said state officials don’t know yet what is being asked of them, and will first need to do “an extensive review of the potential benefits or pitfalls of such waivers.”

new mexico human service secretary david scrase said the state was preparing to administer coronavirus vaccines on a limited basis starting in november to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. the broad public vaccine roll-out is slated for january. he said current vaccine provider networks are robust and adequate for the covid-19 effort.

regarding the timing of the cdc request to expedite or waive permits for distribution centers to open nov. 1, scrase said, “i can’t tell you about the political motivations on that.”

a spokesman for tennessee republican gov. bill lee said the state was reviewing its next steps.

“news of a vaccine is encouraging and a testament to the power of american innovation,” said the spokesman, gillum ferguson.

and in florida, republican gov. ron desantis said he wasn’t aware of the cdc news, but he said people shouldn’t think that the virus will be gone in two months once a vaccine is released.

“i would hope that the federal government would kind of take the lead on that,” said desantis, a trump ally. “hopefully they have a plan to do it and will really focus on those vulnerable among us.”

Trump Moves to Cut Federal Funding From Democratic Cities,21,illuuz,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-funding-cities.html,2,1599132351.0,,"a furious mr. cuomo, in an evening conference call with reporters, said the president’s letter was “another attempt to kill new york city,” where the president was long a resident and developer before officially moving to florida last year. “everything that he could possibly do in his power to hurt new york city he has done,” mr. cuomo said, adding: “the best thing he did for new york city was leave. good riddance. let him go to florida. be careful not to get covid.”

mr. cuomo also derided the president as thinking he was “a king.”

“it’s cheap, it’s political, it’s gratuitous, and it’s illegal,” the governor said of the memo. mr. trump, he said, “better have an army if he thinks he’s going to walk down the street in new york.”

mayor jenny durkan of seattle said in an interview that the president’s call was a tactic that would further divide americans when the country desperately needed leadership that could bring people together. she said she did not believe that the president could “defund” cities, calling the actions unlawful.

“it seems the only place where there is no respect for the rule of law is the white house,” ms. durkan said.

mayor ted wheeler of portland tweeted that mr. trump “continues to believe that disenfranchising people living in this country to advance his petty grudges is an effective political strategy.”

“the rest of us know it is dangerous, destructive, and divisive,” he wrote.

violent crime always increases in the summer, but the rise has been extreme this year in new york. since may, the city has recorded 791 shootings, an increase of more than 140 compared with the same period last year. the 180 murders recorded from may to august is more than 50 percent above the same period in 2019.

in august alone, there were 242 shootings in new york, compared with 91 the same month last year, and the number of murders rose to 53 from 36. as a result, the city surpassed 1,000 shootings before labor day, making it the worst year for gun violence since 2015, with four months left to go."

Election Update: Biden Gets Good Polls In Arizona And Wisconsin — And A Bad One In Pennsylvania,134,ilwrx6,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-biden-gets-good-polls-in-arizona-and-wisconsin-and-a-bad-one-in-pennsylvania/,55,1599179303.0,,"welcome to fivethirtyeight’s election update for thursday, september 3! we’ve now gotten several state polls conducted entirely after the end of the republican national convention, and they are consistent with the tale told by post-convention national polls: the rnc hasn’t boosted president trump enough to meaningfully improve his odds of winning the election. in fact, the state polls we’ve gotten this week have been pretty darn good for joe biden — with one big exception that we’ll get to in a minute.

probably the most eye-opening state poll was fox news’s survey of arizona, which gave biden a healthy 9-percentage-point lead. the poll was taken in the immediate wake of the rnc, and although candidates generally poll higher right after their conventions, fox found trump in a worse position compared with its previous poll. morning consult appeared to confirm biden’s upward trajectory in arizona, releasing an aug. 21-30 poll showing biden up by 10. (that was a big shift from trump’s 2-point lead there in morning consult’s aug. 7-16 poll.)

previously, arizona polling had been a little disappointing for biden, given that the state appeared primed to move into the spotlight as one of the top 2020 swing states. but these two good polls for biden helped the democrat jump out to a clearer lead in our arizona forecast (although it’s still pretty close to a toss-up):

in addition, biden now leads trump by 4.6 points in our weighted average of polls of arizona. that’s significant because, if you were to line up all 50 states from those where biden has the biggest polling lead to those where trump’s lead is biggest, right now arizona would be the electoral college “tipping point” — the state that puts one candidate over the top. (that said, our forecast, which blends the polls with election “fundamentals” like the economy to predict where the race will stand in november, maintains that pennsylvania is the likeliest state to wind up as the tipping point on election day.)

fox news also had good news for biden in wisconsin, putting the democrat ahead by 8 points. and two other recent polls (from morning consult and opinium) staked biden to similarly large leads — 10 and 13 points, respectively. notably, all three of these polls were conducted mostly or entirely after police shot jacob blake, a black man, in the wisconsin city of kenosha, kicking off protests where two demonstrators were killed (a militia member has been charged with their murder). but contrary to what many commentators have insisted, those tragic events — and the trump campaign’s focus on the violent fallout and a “law and order” message — don’t appear to be boosting the president’s standing in the state. biden’s chances of winning it are up to 73 in 100, per our forecast.

the one state where trump does seem to have emerged from the conventions in better shape is pennsylvania; monmouth university now has trump and biden in a virtual tie among likely voters there. biden is 3 percentage points ahead in monmouth’s high-turnout scenario and 1 point ahead in a low-turnout scenario. in monmouth’s july 9-13 poll of the keystone state, biden led by 10 points in the former scenario and 7 points in the latter. as a result, our forecast shows trump with a better chance to win pennsylvania than he’s had in months.

it’s a bit surprising to see biden polling relatively poorly in pennsylvania, the state where he was born and one that he references frequently on the campaign trail. according to the polling averages with monmouth factored in, he currently leads trump by just 3.4 points there — a smaller lead than in demographically similar michigan (6.5 points) and wisconsin (7.1 points).

that said, although monmouth is an excellent pollster, its post-convention survey may be an outlier. monmouth’s sample sizes are on the small side, and the company isn’t afraid to publish results that diverge from the consensus (that’s a good thing), so its polling can sometimes be subject to large swings.

and the fact remains that biden is still more likely than trump to win pennsylvania. indeed, as you’ve seen, he is more likely than trump to win all three of these crucial states. that’s a big reason why he still has a 69 in 100 chance of winning the electoral college overall — almost exactly the same position he was in before the conventions.

Tesla retreats for third day as investors cash in on gains,54,ily09p,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tesla-stocks/tesla-retreats-for-third-day-as-investors-cash-in-on-gains-idUKKBN25U2IE?il=0,11,1599183003.0,,"(reuters) - tesla inc shares fell for a third straight day on thursday, as investors who have been betting on the electric-car maker’s growth prospects cashed in on the meteoric rally in the stock price this year.

file photo: the tesla logo is seen on a car in los angeles, california, u.s., july 9, 2020. reuters/lucy nicholson

market analysts and traders called it a near-term profit-taking, triggered by the company’s plan to raise $5 billion from the market and the stake sale by the second largest shareholder baillie gifford, in a stock that has surged fivefold in 2020.

they expect it to be short-lived. “it’s just a poster child for the growth trade and there’s a bit of general rotation,” a london-based trader told reuters.

meanwhile, edinburgh-based baillie gifford told herald scotland the investment firm remains a “strong supporter” of tesla, but had to sell its passive stake due to norms that limit the weight of a stock in clients’ portfolios.

gifford cut its stake to 4.25% compared to 7.67% as of dec. 31, making it now the fourth largest stakeholder, according to refinitiv data.

“i know baillie gifford were a kind of forced seller to stay within the mandates, but (an) evidence of core investor profit-taking as the company start a sell off of $5 billion stock,” the trader said.

ever since tesla surprised wall street by delivering on chief executive elon musk’s promise of a profit in its third quarter in october last year, its shares have risen nearly nine-fold.

the world’s most valuable carmaker has gone on to register three more profitable quarters, clearing a hurdle that could lead to its inclusion in the benchmark s&p 500 index.

the index rebalances every quarter, but a stock can be added to the index at any point once a company becomes eligible for consideration.

howard silverblatt, senior index analyst at s&p dow jones indices, declined to comment on potential index membership changes.

the surge in shares during the covid-19 pandemic have also led tesla and apple inc to split their richly priced stock.

the iphone maker’s shares, which have jumped more than 35% since it announced its split, fell for the second session, down 5.2%, while tesla shares were down 6.5% in early trading on thursday."

in a noon news conference, d.c. police chief pete newsham stressed that kay's death is a tragedy.

according to the chief, kay had a history with law enforcement and was a confirmed member of a local gang.

""i'm sure deon kay fell through multiple safety nets before yesterday afternoon,"" newsham noted.

newsham described the effort of releasing the body camera footage as ""herculean"" because of the steps involved in the procedure.

he noted, however, that police were concerned about misinformation circulating in what he described as ""the current climate.""

protests and unrest have followed in the wake of george floyd's death at the hands of police in minneapolis - as well as other incidents in which officers have been caught on camera in deadly incidents.

following kay's shooting on wednesday night, more than 100 protesters gathered at the d.c. police department's 7th district station.

Man Linked to Killing at a Portland Protest Says He Acted in Self-Defense,10,im6tnl,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7g8vb/man-linked-to-killing-at-a-portland-protest-says-he-acted-in-self-defense,7,1599212321.0,,"ever since a member of the right-wing “patriot prayer” group was shot and killed during a violent rally in downtown portland august 29, the police investigation has reportedly focused on 48-year-old michael forest reinoehl, an army veteran and father of two who has provided what he called “security” at black lives matter protests.

the wall steet journal reported earlier that reinoehl was a person of interest in the killing of aaron “jay” danielson, who was taking part in a massive pro-trump caravan that began in clackamas earlier in the day.

in a conversation with freelance journalist donovan farley shared with vice news, reinoehl said he believed he and a friend were about to be stabbed, and that he acted in self defense. vice news has not independently verified details of his story.

shortly after vice news reported this conversation, reinoehl was killed in an encounter with officers when the federal fugitive task force attempted to arrest him according to the new york times.

“you know, lots of lawyers suggest that i shouldn't even be saying anything, but i feel it's important that the world at least gets a little bit of what's really going on,” reinoehl said. “i had no choice. i mean, i, i had a choice. i could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. but i wasn't going to do that.”

portland has been a flashpoint for protests since the 2016 election, but after the death of george floyd in may, protests have gotten messier and increasingly dangerous. in august, a right-wing protester was arrested for firing into a crowd of black lives matter protesters. proud boy alan swinney brandished a gun and pointed it at protesters, and a group of reportedly left-aligned protesters were seen on video dragging a truck driver out of his vehicle and beating him up.

the killing of danielson is the first linked to an antifacist protester in recent years. it happened one week after 17-year-old pro-trump protester kyle rittenhouse allegedly shot three protesters at a march in kenosha, wisconsin, killing two. rittenhouse’s lawyer is claiming he acted in self defense.

reinoehl had been a nightly presence at black lives matter protests in portland for months. in early july, he was arrested for carrying a loaded handgun at a protest and resisting arrest. the wsj reports that the case remains open. later that month, he was shot in the arm while attempting to wrestle a gun away from a right-wing protester during a skirmish.

reinoehl said he became aware of the pro-trump truck parade when he saw what he described as “hundreds of trucks with flags on them,” while driving around portland earlier in the day with his teenage son.

“i notified my friends of what i had seen and finished what i was doing with my son, got home and then received a phone call that it might be a good idea to come down there,” he said. “security may be needed not knowing what that would entail. i had no idea what i was getting into.”

“i’m seeing all these vehicles with hatred, people in the backs of the trucks yelling and screaming and swinging bats and sticks at protesters that are just standing there yelling at them,” he said.

at 8:45 p.m., reinoehl said he went to the aid of a friend surrounded by trucks laden with armed pro-trump protesters. “i saw someone that is a dear and close friend of mine in the movement by himself basically confronting all these vehicles,” reinhoel told farley. “and so i let him know that i'm here, parked my vehicle and joined up with him, found myself in the intersection in front of the food trucks surrounded by trucks and cars that had weapons.”

reindoehl stressed that people participating in the pro-trump caravan were heavily armed in those trucks, and that they carried “not just paintball guns,” as reported in the press.

he found himself in a confrontation with a man who he says threatened him and another protester with a knife. “had i stepped forward, he would have maced or stabbed me,” reinoehl said.

bystander video from multiple angles show a man who resembles reinoehl and appears to have the same neck tattoo fire two shots at danielson and then walk away. “i was confident that i did not hit anyone innocent and i made my exit,” he said.

since the shooting, reinoehl said he’s gone into hiding, and moved his children to a safe place after shots were fired into his house just hours after the incident. “they're out hunting me,” he said. “there's nightly posts of the hunt and where they're going to be hunting. they made a post saying the deer are going to feel lucky this year because it's open season on michael right now.”

he had not turned himself in, he said, because he believed right-wing protesters were collaborating with police, who will not protect him or his family.

he said at the time of the confrontation and the shooting, there were no police present to help. “there was definitely nobody in sight, no police officer, nobody at all that could intervene. it was a free-for-all. and the police were letting it happen,” he said.

two days later, he said he had no regrets about his actions. “if the life of anybody i care about is in danger, and there's something i can do to prevent it … i think that any good human being would do the same thing,” he said.

reinoehl said he’s spoken to attorneys who say he’s “got a viable case for self-defense and protection because there’s a definite threat to my life.”

on thursday, portland mayor ted wheeler said the investigation into the incident is still in early stages. “we don’t even have all the facts yet. we haven’t been able to speak to all of the witnesses. we haven’t been able to process all of the video that’s come from local businesses,” he told koin 6 news.

“i feel that they're trying to, you know, put other charges on me. they’ll find another way to keep me in,” reinoehl said when asked why he didn’t tell his story to the police. “honestly, i hate to say it, but i see a civil war right around the corner,” he said. “that that shot felt like the beginning of a war.”"
"Trump encourages supporters to try to vote twice, sparking uproar",306,im8jmm,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-vote/trump-encourages-supporters-to-try-to-vote-twice-sparking-uproar-idUSKBN25U0KK,114,1599219070.0,,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump has urged residents in the critical political battleground of north carolina to try to vote twice in the nov. 3 election, once by mail and once in person, igniting a furor for appearing to urge a potential act of voter fraud.

“let them send it in and let them go vote,” trump said in an interview on wednesday with wect-tv in wilmington, north carolina. “and if the system is as good as they say it is, then obviously they won’t be able to vote” in person.

trump has repeatedly asserted, without evidence, that mail-in voting - expanded by some states because of the coronavirus pandemic - would increase fraud and disrupt the november election, although experts say voter fraud of any kind is extremely rare in the united states.

at a rally on thursday night, trump repeated his call for voters to go the polls even if they have mailed in their ballot, and he suggested democrats would try to steal the election by manipulating the mail-in vote.

“you have to make sure your vote counts, because the only way they’re gonna beat us is by doing that kind of stuff,” trump said in latrobe, pennsylvania, a swing state in the election.

voting more than once in an election is illegal, and in some states, including north carolina, it is a felony not only to vote more than once but also to induce another to do so.

ballots are due to be mailed in north carolina on friday.

state attorney general josh stein, a democrat, wrote on twitter that the republican president had “outrageously encouraged” north carolinians “to break the law in order to help him sow chaos in our election.”

stein wrote: “make sure you vote, but do not vote twice! i will do everything in my power to make sure the will of the people is upheld in november.”

trump’s campaign and the white house later denied that he meant to tell people to vote twice.

“the president is not suggesting anyone do anything unlawful,” white house spokeswoman kayleigh mcenany told fox news channel on thursday. “what he said very clearly there is make sure your vote is tabulated and if it is not, then vote.”

however, in a series of tweets on thursday morning, trump again urged his supporters to vote early by mail and then follow up by attempting to vote in person.

“on election day, or early voting go to your polling place to see whether or not your mail in vote has been tabulated (counted),” trump wrote. “if it has you will not be able to vote & the mail in system worked properly. if it has not been counted, vote.”

while some states begin counting mail-in ballots two weeks before the election date, others do not begin counting them until the date of the election, in some cases after polls close.

twitter inc twtr.n later placed warnings over trump's tweets for violating its rules on civic and election integrity. facebook inc fb.o also placed a new label on trump’s post, in which it said ""voting by mail has a long history of trustworthiness in the us and the same is predicted this year.""

facebook also said it would remove the video of trump talking about voting twice, if people shared it without any captions or context, or in support of what the president said. a spokesman told reuters on thursday afternoon that facebook had not yet identified or removed such versions of the video.

voting twice ‘a felony’

the democratic national committee accused trump of encouraging voter fraud and said the president was undermining confidence in the fairness of the election.

“let’s be clear: voting by mail is a safe and secure way for americans to participate in our democracy — and trump should be working to make it easier to vote, not harder,” reyna walters-morgan, the dnc’s director of voter protection, said in a statement.

patrick gannon, a spokesman for north carolina’s state board of elections, said a person would not be able to cast two ballots, regardless of whether they voted by mail or in person first. the first vote that is received and processed is the one that counts, he said.

“voting twice in an election is a felony,” gannon said. “if you put a ballot in the mail, and it hasn’t arrived yet, and then you vote in person before your absentee ballot has arrived, your in-person vote will count.”

he said if an absentee ballot showed up after a person had voted in person, it would not be counted.

many americans vote by mail because they cannot make it to the polls. in 2016, nearly one in four voters cast presidential ballots by mail.

the coronavirus pandemic is expected to result in a record number of mail-in ballots this year as voters seek to avoid the risk of infection. experts have cautioned the expected surge means a winner may not be clear on election night given the time it will take to count and verify all the ballots.

trump campaigned on wednesday in north carolina, known as a battleground state because its population can swing either to republicans or democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.

national opinion polls show trump, 74, trailing his democratic rival joe biden, 77, who was vice president under president barack obama. democrats accuse republicans of trying to suppress the vote to help their side."
Federal task force kills Portland shooting suspect at arrest,28,imbj93,https://apnews.com/f0418fd4a37be8d9b6953c8359109587,8,1599232716.0,,"officials work at the area late thursday, sept. 3, 2020, in lacey wash., where a man suspected of fatally shooting a supporter of a right-wing group in portland, ore., the week before was killed as investigators moved in to arrest him. michael reinoehl, 48, was killed as a federal task force attempted to apprehend him in lacey, a senior justice department official said. reinoehl was the prime suspect in the killing of 39-year-old aaron “jay” danielson, who was shot in the chest saturday night, the official said.

officials work at the area late thursday, sept. 3, 2020, in lacey wash., where a man suspected of fatally shooting a supporter of a right-wing group in portland, ore., the week before was killed as investigators moved in to arrest him. michael reinoehl, 48, was killed as a federal task force attempted to apprehend him in lacey, a senior justice department official said. reinoehl was the prime suspect in the killing of 39-year-old aaron “jay” danielson, who was shot in the chest saturday night, the official said. (ap photo/ted warren)

portland, ore. (ap) — ‎both the suspect in the slaying of the right-wing protester in portland, oregon last weekend and the victim had handguns when their confrontation started after dueling street demonstrations, according to court documents made public friday.

the documents said victim aaron “jay” danielson, a supporter of a right-wing group called patriot prayer, was wearing a loaded glock pistol in a holster and had bear spray and an expandable metal baton when someone said something like “wanna go,” which is frequently a challenge to a fight.

authorities have said they believe antifa supporter michael forest reinoehl, who was fatally shot by federal agents late thursday in washington state, then opened fire and killed danielson after he took part in a caravan of president donald trump supporters who drove pickup trucks through downtown portland.

some of the trump supporters fired paint ball pellets at counter-demonstrators, while black lives matter protesters tried to block the vehicles.

law enforcement officials released the information they had compiled — justifying an arrest warrant for reinoehl on a second-degree murder charge in the aug. 29 killing — one day after reinoehl’s killing shook a quiet suburb of olympia, washington.

bystanders thursday night ducked for cover behind automobiles from dozens of gunshots as four agents serving on a u.s. marshals service task force opened fire at reinoehl.

authorities said reinoehl, 48, was armed with a semi-automatic handgun. a witness who was driving to the small apartment complex that reinoehl was leaving said she saw him open fire from a car and that the officers returned fire.

reinoehl then got out of the car and started running away but collapsed amid more gunfire, the witness, deshirlynn chatman, told the olympian newspaper.

“he did open fire first,” she said in a video posted by the olympian. lt. ray brady of the thurston county sheriff’s department said investigators have not concluded whether reinoehl fired any shots.

another video shot during the immediate aftermath showed reinoehl lying motionless on the street with law enforcement officers in tactical gear and automatic rifles milling around. after several minutes, one man performed chest compressions on reinoehl.

“yeah, i don’t think he’s going to make it,” jashon spencer narrated on the video that he posted on facebook.

brady said he did not believe the officers involved in the shooting had body cameras or dashboard cameras on their vehicles.

in a videotaped interview broadcast the evening of his death by vice news, reinoehl came close to admitting he shot danielson, a supporter of a right-wing group called patriot prayer, on aug. 29 after a caravan of president donald trump backers drove their pickup trucks through downtown portland.

reinoehl said he “had no choice” but to do what he did because he thought he and a friend were about to be stabbed.

“i hate to say it, but i see a civil war right around the corner,” reinoehl, with a partially covered tattoo of a raised fist on the right side of his neck, said in the interview.

reinoehl told vice news he was an anti-fascist but was not a member of antifa, an umbrella description for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events. reinoehl previously described himself in a social media post as “100% antifa.”

facebook said on friday they removed pages related to patriot prayer, whose members have brawled with protesters from antifa and other demonstrators in the past.

“they were removed as part of our ongoing efforts to remove violent social militias from our platform,” facebook spokesperson sally aldous said.

it was not immediately clear where reinoehl hid out in the five days that elapsed since shooting in portland.

brady said the “suspect” who was killed — he declined to name him as reinoehl — left an apartment shortly around 7 p.m. thursday, got into a vehicle, and was confronted by the task force members. they fired into the vehicle, reinoehl got out and ran and was shot, brady said.

federal agents from the fbi and the u.s. marshals service had located reinoehl on thursday after a warrant was issued for his arrest and reinoehl pulled a gun during the encounter, a senior justice department official in washington said. the official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity.

a u.s. marshals service statement issued later said the fugitive task force had “attempted to peacefully arrest him.”

“initial reports indicate the suspect produced a firearm, threatening the lives of law enforcement officers” the statement said.

u.s. marshals service fugitive task forces — comprised of deputy marshals, other federal agents and local law enforcement officers from a variety of agencies — apprehend violent felons and other suspects.

brady said the four task force members who fired their weapons were two pierce county sheriff’s deputies, a police officer from the washington city of lakewood and washington state department of corrections officer.

brady said investigators haven’t yet determined how many rounds were fired but witnesses chad smith and chase cutler, who were working on cars nearby, told the news tribune they saw two suvs converge on a man in a vehicle at the apartment complex. they said they heard 40 to 50 shots, the tacoma, washington, newspaper reported.

brady said he doesn’t think the suspect lived at the address where he was shot, and that it was not clear what brought him to lacey, on the outskirts of olympia, the state capital.

reinoehl’s sister, who requested her name not be used because of the threats she and her family have been receiving, said in an interview with the associated press friday that she had had not been in touch with him for three years.

she said her brother’s son and daughter “need to be allowed to grieve what happened.”

“my heart breaks for those kids but hopefully they can put their lives back together and sort through this and process the trauma that no one that young should ever have to deal with,” the sister said.

"Rural telecom networks would spend $1.8 billion to remove Huawei, ZTE equipment: FCC",8,imkbta,https://ca.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-usa-china-telecom-idCAKBN25V23F-OCATC,2,1599269402.0,,"file photo: surveillance cameras are seen in front of a huawei logo in belgrade, serbia, august 11, 2020. picture taken august 11, 2020. reuters/marko djurica

washington (reuters) - u.s. rural telecommunications networks, which have relied on inexpensive network equipment from china's huawei technologies co and zte corp 000063.sz, have told the government that it would cost $1.837 billion to replace those switches and routers, the federal communications commission said on friday.

in june, the fcc formally designated huawei and zte as threats to u.s. national security, a declaration that bars u.s. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies.

the u.s. telecommunications regulator voted last year to propose requiring rural carriers to remove and replace equipment from the two chinese companies from u.s. networks.

fcc commissioners said the report shows the need for congress to approve funding to replace that equipment. congress has authorized reimbursements but has not approved the money.

the fcc said it believes the carriers would be eligible for reimbursements of about $1.62 billion.

“by identifying the presence of insecure equipment and services in our networks, we can now work to ensure that these networks — especially those of small and rural carriers — rely on infrastructure from trusted vendors,” fcc chairman ajit pai said, urging congress “to appropriate funding to reimburse carriers for replacing any equipment or services determined to be a national security threat so that we can protect our networks.”

the fcc identified more than 50 mostly smaller telecom companies with zte or huawei equipment or using services from the companies, as well as a few larger companies like centurylink ctl.n and verizon communications inc vz.n

verizon said its networks do not include equipment from huawei or zte but has a small number of devices, called voicelink, made by huawei that some customers use to make voice calls. verizon said it expects to retire all voicelink devices this year.

centurylink said the “legacy equipment at issue cannot be used to route or redirect user traffic” and is not covered under restrictions established by congress. the company added it has “actively been removing and replacing equipment and continue to work with federal policymakers to accelerate the process.”"
Trump Administration Closing Military Newspaper that Informs Troops — and Speaks for Them,290,imkt2m,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/us/politics/stars-and-stripes-trump-military.html,52,1599270880.0,,"but mr. trump’s denials are hampered by the fact that he has often disdained veterans who had been captured in war, including john mccain, who served as a republican senator from arizona.

signs of a growing discontent among troops for the commander in chief are starting to show.

a military times poll released this week showed a continued decline in active-duty service members’ views of mr. trump, and a slight but significant preference for former vice president joseph r. biden jr. in the upcoming election among troops surveyed.

the poll, taken in late july and early august, before the political conventions, found that half of 1,018 respondents surveyed had an unfavorable view of mr. trump, compared with 38 percent who had a favorable view. in a poll conducted at the start of mr. trump’s presidency, 37 percent of troops had an unfavorable opinion, and 46 percent had a favorable view.

stars and stripes first started as a publication for union troops during the civil war, when soldiers commanded by ulysses s. grant overran bloomfield, mo., en route to cape girardeau. former pressmen were among the troops, and they set up shop at a local newspaper office that had been abandoned by its confederate-sympathizing publisher.

since then, the paper has been on newsstands in military “px” shopping areas and command tents in places like langres, france, during world war ii and afghanistan and iraq more recently. it has published cartoons that lampooned commanders, as well as news articles and commentary that are often at odds with the official view from the pentagon or the white house.

max lederer, the publisher of stars and stripes since 2007, said the administration’s rolling conflict with the news media had given cover to pentagon officials to move against the publication.

as an example of articles that he said contradicted the administration’s narrative, he cited reporting by stars and stripes this year on fort hood, texas, which a recent article called “the army’s most crime-ridden post” after the killing in april of a soldier there, specialist vanessa guillen."
Trump's job losses are the worst of any American president on record,2,immelc,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/economy/august-jobs-report-trump-jobs-record/index.html,9,1599275979.0,,"new york (cnn business) president donald trump is heading into the general election with the worst jobs numbers of any president, based on records that go back to world war ii.

that's not going to change in the two months between now and election day, no matter how the economy does.

the us economy is down 4.7 million jobs since january 2017 when trump took office, according to the labor department.

the august jobs report released friday showed employers added back about 1.4 million jobs , bringing the unemployment rate to 8.4%. that is still well short of what would be needed to give trump a positive jobs record by november 3.

the only other president in the last 80 years to own an overall loss in jobs between his inauguration and the following election day was george w. bush in 2004. that was because of the so-called "" jobless recovery "" after the recession sparked by the dot-com bust. but the loss of 605,000 jobs through september of 2004 was a fraction of the job losses that happened under the trump administration.

to be sure, the bulk of the job losses in the trump economy were precipitated by the shutdown orders associated with the worst pandemic in 100 years.

""i would say covid-19 is one hell of an extenuating circumstance,"" said greg valliere, chief us policy strategist for agf investments.

but there are many who question whether the trump administration's handling of the pandemic is responsible for deeper economic damage than would have taken place had the white house taken a more active role in fighting coronavirus. and even with millions being called back to work in recent months, there were more were 13.6 million people looking for work and unable to find one in the most recent reading.

there is only one more jobs report — for september — that will be released before election day, and the labor department will start counting the jobs that make up that report next week. even if congress pushes through another covid-19 financial stimulus package soon, it won't wipe out all of the job losses that have occurred during trump's term.

trump's modest jobs record before the pandemic

president trump has frequently boasted about his pre-pandemic jobs record. and he has promised that once the pandemic is over, the job gains will return

but data show that his administration's job gains before the pandemic were only average compared with predecessors.

there were 6.8 million jobs added between the inauguration and february of this year, a 5% gain from when trump took office. measured by percentage, that's only the 11th best record out of the last 20 presidential terms. (percentage gain is the best way to take into account the population growth over the last 80 years.)

the best percentage gain was in the period between 1941 and 1944, when the end of the great depression and the nation's entry into world war ii resulted in a 21% gain in jobs during president franklin d. roosevelt's third term.

effect of job losses on past votes

this doesn't necessarily mean that trump will be joining the ranks of unemployed.

the direction of the economy can be far more important than the raw numbers, said valliere. that could be good news for trump since in the last four months employers have brought back 10.6 million workers who were temporarily laid off earlier in the year.

""the direction in unemployment in all likelihood will be in trump's favor,"" he said earlier this week. ""if we get more than a million jobs added back on friday and unemployment drops below 10%, you know he's going to brag about numbers like that.""

george w. bush, the only president with a record of job losses leading up to the election, was nonetheless reelected in 2004. he was helped by the economy adding 1.5 million jobs between january and september of that year.

by contrast, even a good overall jobs record can be hurt by job losses leading up to the election. jimmy carter had one of the best job creation records between his inaugural and september of 1980 — 9.5 million jobs added, a gain of nearly 12%. but throughout 1980, job losses mounted as employers cut nearly 800,000 jobs between march and september. that, along with high inflation and the iran hostage crisis, led to his defeat.

'problems on the horizon'

the job rebound appears to be slowing, as many of the jobs that were easy to bring back are already back, said mark zandi, chief economist with moody's analytics. the 1.4 million jobs added in august was down from the 1.7 million added in july, as the cnn business recovery dashboard shows

many of the millions of people who are out of work may be losing faith that they will be getting their jobs back. the 10.6 million people who returned to the jobs were mostly working in restaurants, hotels and retailers, noted zandi.

""that will only carry the job recovery so far,"" he said. ""there is evidence that things are slowing. and there are problems on the horizon.""

so what does that mean for trump's re-election chances?

""i think people are still making up their minds,"" said zandi. he said that's why the august and september jobs reports matter.

""do they view it as glass half full glass half empty?"" he asked."
Compromise keeps 'Black Lives Matter' paint off Boardwalk,8,imo2d5,https://apnews.com/ef3d20b4021a5b4a020ae08d89c148ba,4,1599281529.0,,"atlantic city, n.j., mayor marty small holds a news conference on the atlantic city boardwalk on june 11, 2020. small will lead a ceremony on friday, sept. 4, 2020, in which the words ""black lives matter"" will be painted on a street instead of on the boardwalk, where a city activist had wanted to write the words.

(ap photo/wayne parry)

atlantic city, n.j. (ap) — a “black lives matter” protest that arose amid threats of vandalism and arrest ended in atlantic city’s mayor and a community activist who had threatened to paint those words on the seaside gambling resort’s historic boardwalk peacefully joining together friday.

mayor marty small and protest organizer steve young picked up roller paint brushes and helped write those words on the pavement of martin luther king jr. boulevard in front of the city’s civil rights garden.

“this city truly understands the black lives matter movement,” said small, who is black and who had announced plans earlier in the week for the city to co-opt the event in order to spare the boardwalk. “in order for all lives to matter, black lives need to matter.”

“we are saying the same thing right now — black lives matter,” young said. “and as long as we have something in common, there’s plenty of room at this table.”

weeks ago, young announced plans to write the slogan on the city’s boardwalk. but small said doing so would be illegal. he then decided the city would hold its own event where the slogan would be painted on a roadway.

at young’s event, speakers included gwen carr, the mother of eric garner, who was put into a deadly chokehold by new york city police. his dying words, “i can’t breathe,” have become a rallying cry.

“they say enough is enough of the marching,” carr said. “but they’re still killing us. we have to make america uncomfortable because they have made us uncomfortable.”

while young’s rally was being held with about a dozen demonstrators outside a boardwalk hall that was boarded up in advance of the protest, volunteers were already slathering paint onto the roadway. but they deliberately left some letters unfinished so community members could participate in the painting.

young and small jointly filled in a latter “a,” then passed their paint rollers to children who continued.

despite the good feelings, authorities were prepared for possible disturbances. an armored personnel carrier with what appeared to be a battering ram attached to it idled outside police headquarters, its red and blue lights flashing and a driver at the wheel.

small said that every friday afternoon of labor day weekend henceforth, atlantic city will commence a monthlong celebration of “black lives matter” community events.

there have been three racial justice demonstrations in atlantic city this year. the first, on may 31, was followed by theft and property destruction for which about 100 people were charged. a second on june 6 was peaceful.

young organized a july fourth protest as the casinos were permitted to reopen after more than three months of being shut because of the coronavirus pandemic. he was among seven people arrested when marchers tried to block the entrance of the atlantic city expressway, the main route to the city and the casinos that are its lifeblood.

as a consequence of the july protest, whose stated goal was to “shut the city down,” the city is trying to strip young of two city posts he holds.

Congresswoman denied access to Florida postal facilities,6,imorci,https://apnews.com/e9d0f3cc182e813baba1781afca06591,2,1599283802.0,,"miami (ap) — u.s. rep. debbie wasserman schultz said she was denied access to two u.s. postal service facilities in south florida on friday morning following evidence of delivery delays and other problems.

wasserman schultz, whose district includes parts of broward and miami-dade counties, said in a statement that her staff had notified the postal service on thursday that she was planning to visit two miami-area processing centers friday morning. she said when she arrived at each location, she was prevented from observing a typical morning shift and told she would have to follow visitation protocols to tour the sites.

“denying congress access to the facilities is denying the vital public oversight of our mail system,” wasserman schultz said.

wasserman schultz said she wanted to tour the centers after receiving photos of pallets of undelivered mail sitting in the facilities this week, with dates indicating delivery that was intended for july. postal employees also told her that sorting machines continue to remain idle.

postal service spokeswoman kimberly frum said they didn’t receive notification from wasserman schultz about the tours until thursday afternoon.

“we spoke with her staff to explain that we were unable to set up the tour on such short notice, but would be happy to accommodate her at another time,” frum said in an email. “we look forward to working with the congresswoman and her staff to arrange a visit in the near future.”

wasserman schultz, who serves on the house committee on oversight and reform, said she conducted a similar inspection of a postal facility earlier this year without lengthy advance notification requirements.

that was before louis dejoy became postmaster general. dejoy, a major donor to republicans and president donald trump, took over the agency in june after a career in logistics and set in motion a set of policy changes that have delayed mail and sparked concern over the agency’s ability to process mail-in ballots this fall.

he has appeared before congress twice in recent weeks to testify about the removal of the agency’s blue collection boxes and mail sorting machines, as well as changes to trucking operations and overtime hours that postal workers say are resulting in delays. amid a public outcry, dejoy said he halted some of the changes until after the november election.

“i’m a member of the house committee on oversight and reform. my job is to oversee the postal service,” wasserman schultz said. “postmaster dejoy has already obstructed the committee by failing to provide requested documents in a timely way. now he’s denying congress access to public facilities.”"
Facebook removes pages of right-wing group Patriot Prayer after Portland unrest,95,imsl4y,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-protests-portland-faceboo/facebook-removes-pages-of-right-wing-group-patriot-prayer-after-portland-unrest-idUSKBN25V2UH,18,1599298385.0,,"san francisco (reuters) - facebook inc fb.o on friday removed the pages of u.s. right-wing group patriot prayer and its founder joey gibson, a company spokesman told reuters.

patriot prayer has hosted dozens of pro-gun, pro-trump rallies. attendees have repeatedly clashed with left-wing groups around portland, oregon, where one group supporter was killed this week.

the victim, 39-year-old aaron danielson, was walking home on saturday night after a pro-trump demonstration in the city when he was shot.

facebook took down the pages as part of efforts to remove “violent social militias” from its social networks, spokesman andy stone said.

the company updated its policies last month to ban groups that demonstrate significant risks to public safety.

its dangerous organizations policy now includes groups that celebrate violent acts or suggest they will use weapons, even if they are not directly organizing violence.

in a statement posted on patriot prayer’s website, gibson accused facebook of a double standard.

“antifa groups murdered my friend while he was walking home, and instead of the multibillion dollar company banning portland antifa pages they ban patriot prayer, joey gibson and several other grandmas that are admins,” he wrote.

antifa is a largely unstructured, far-left movement whose followers broadly aim to confront those they view as authoritarian or racist.

gibson espouses non-violence but is accused by anti-fascist groups of provoking confrontations.

after the shooting of danielson he cautioned supporters not to seek revenge, but rather “push back politically, spiritually.”

as of earlier this week, the patriot prayer page had nearly 45,000 followers on facebook. it was created in 2017.

facebook last week removed content associated with the kenosha guard, a group which had posted a “call to arms” in kenosha, wisconsin.

the company acted the day after two people were shot and killed at protests in the city, which broke out in response to the police shooting of a black man earlier that week.

users had flagged the material to facebook 455 times but were told initially it did not violate the company's policies, buzzfeed reported here."
Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers’,279,imufs1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/,170,1599306480.0,,"trump’s understanding of concepts such as patriotism, service, and sacrifice has interested me since he expressed contempt for the war record of the late senator john mccain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of the north vietnamese. “he’s not a war hero,” trump said in 2015 while running for the republican nomination for president. “i like people who weren’t captured.”

read: john mccain’s death brought out the worst in the trump administration

there was no precedent in american politics for the expression of this sort of contempt, but the performatively patriotic trump did no damage to his candidacy by attacking mccain in this manner. nor did he set his campaign back by attacking the parents of humayun khan, an army captain who was killed in iraq in 2004.

trump remained fixated on mccain, one of the few prominent republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. when mccain died, in august 2018, trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, “we’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,” and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. “what the fuck are we doing that for? guy was a fucking loser,” the president told aides. trump was not invited to mccain’s funeral. (these sources, and others quoted in this article, spoke on condition of anonymity. the white house did not return earlier calls for comment, but alyssa farah, a white house spokesperson, emailed me this statement shortly after this story was posted: “this report is false. president trump holds the military in the highest regard. he’s demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn: delivering on his promise to give our troops a much needed pay raise, increasing military spending, signing critical veterans reforms, and supporting military spouses. this has no basis in fact.”)

eliot a. cohen: america’s generals must stand up to trump

trump’s understanding of heroism has not evolved since he became president. according to sources with knowledge of the president’s views, he seems to genuinely not understand why americans treat former prisoners of war with respect. nor does he understand why pilots who are shot down in combat are honored by the military. on at least two occasions since becoming president, according to three sources with direct knowledge of his views, trump referred to former president george h. w. bush as a “loser” for being shot down by the japanese as a navy pilot in world war ii. (bush escaped capture, but eight other men shot down during the same mission were caught, tortured, and executed by japanese soldiers.)

when lashing out at critics, trump often reaches for illogical and corrosive insults, and members of the bush family have publicly opposed him. but his cynicism about service and heroism extends even to the world war i dead buried outside paris—people who were killed more than a quarter century before he was born. trump finds the notion of military service difficult to understand, and the idea of volunteering to serve especially incomprehensible. (the president did not serve in the military; he received a medical deferment from the draft during the vietnam war because of the alleged presence of bone spurs in his feet. in the 1990s, trump said his efforts to avoid contracting sexually transmitted diseases constituted his “personal vietnam.”)"

(ap photo/susan walsh, file)

new york (ap) — as employees of small businesses get their first september paychecks, they’re probably receiving their usual amount — company owners are still withholding money for social security despite a presidential order allowing the tax to be deferred.

the order president donald trump signed aug. 8 allows employers to stop withholding the 6.2% payroll tax from sept. 1 through dec. 31. employees must make under $4,000 every two weeks to qualify. trump said the order was aimed at putting more money into americans’ pockets during the coronavirus outbreak.

small business owners are wary about the plan. the tax must still be paid between jan. 1 and april 30 of next year, which means employees could take an unwanted financial hit or companies might ultimately have to pay the government if staffers leave.

attorney john strohmeyer is having the payroll for his houston firm processed as per usual.

“it doesn’t make much sense. i’m not getting a tax break as an employee or employer. the money is still due by april 30 of next year,” strohmeyer says.

jay starkman says the businesses calling his human resources consulting firm for advice about tax deferral ask whether it’s a good benefit for employees. but they’re not inclined to implement the plan.

“if the employee doesn’t pay the money back, you’re on the hook for it. till that changes, it just doesn’t make sense to give somebody a few more months of money,” says starkman, ceo of engage peo, based in hollywood, florida.

owners also have questions about the payment process that aren’t answered in the guidelines the irs issued last week.

the three-page document is silent on how the money is to be collected after jan. 1, leaving owners wondering if they would have to deduct it paycheck by paycheck or whether staffers would need to come up with a lump sum. owners also don’t know if they’d have to poll staffers individually to see who wants or doesn’t want their taxes deferred.

while many companies use payroll processors or human resources consultants to handle staffers’ pay, implementing a temporary tax deferral is still another layer of work for owners who are focused on running their companies during a pandemic.

strohmeyer says business owners would prefer to focus on changes that affect the long-term running of their companies. “this is a four-month delay. why would you upset your business?”

owners already see the possibility of a bureaucratic headache in tax deferral, says karen kerrigan, president of the advocacy group small business & entrepreneurship council.

“the vast majority of small businesses will likely opt out due to complexity, and the fact that it puts owners or managers in an awkward position of collecting funds or deducting funds from employees’ paychecks in the future, and these could be substantial amounts,” she says.

owners are finding that employees aren’t eager to defer their taxes. attorney arash hashemi’s sole staffer is looking down the road to paying the tax in 2021 and “she’s afraid that will hurt her pocket more than it will help,” he says.

hashemi, whose practice is in los angeles, is also saying “no, thanks.”

“i already have so many obligations to the government, not only federal but state and local. i don’t want to make one more burden for the business,” he says.

michael kipness has surveyed his five staffers and found that “they’re very concerned about having to pay this back later.” his financial advisers tell him that the irs guidance about the tax deferral is confusing.

“we will continue to withhold it, as there’s too much uncertainly right now,” says kipness, ceo of wizard race and sports, a company that gives sports gamblers analyses of races and games.

payroll processor adp is ready to adjust its computer systems to stop withholding the tax if companies request it, says pete isberg, the company’s vice president for government affairs. but so far, there’s little interest, isberg says.

“a lot of businesses are looking at this and saying, ‘i don’t think so,’” isberg says."
"93% of Black Lives Matter Protests Have Been Peaceful, New Report Finds",564,ink4j7,https://time.com/5886348/report-peaceful-protests/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_term=u.s._&linkId=98926806&fbclid=IwAR3bYz0zI8wFBYFDtJTLMoHhELi3ucJ7Ftn29sd-okZMQRX7GluWdwe5tyQ,197,1599418556.0,,"the vast majority of black lives matter protests—more than 93%—have been peaceful, according to a new report published thursday by a nonprofit that researches political violence and protests across the world.

the armed conflict location & event data project (acled) analyzed more than 7,750 black lives matter demonstrations in all 50 states and washington d.c. that took place in the wake of george floyd’s death between may 26 and august 22.

their report states that more than 2,400 locations reported peaceful protests, while fewer than 220 reported “violent demonstrations.” the authors define violent demonstrations as including “acts targeting other individuals, property, businesses, other rioting groups or armed actors.” their definition includes anything from “fighting back against police” to vandalism, property destruction looting, road-blocking using barricades, burning tires or other materials. in cities where protests did turn violent—these demonstrations are “largely confined to specific blocks,” the report says.

the acled report includes protests toppling statues of “colonial figures, slave owners and confederate leaders” as violent incidents. “since floyd’s killing, there have been at least 38 incidents in which demonstrators have significantly damaged or torn down memorials around the country,” the report states.

still, many people continue to believe that black lives matter protests are largely violent—contrary to the report’s findings. acled highlights a recent morning consult poll in which 42% of respondents believe “most protesters (associated with the blm movement) are trying to incite violence or destroy property.” acled suggests this “disparity stems from political orientation and biased media framing… such as disproportionate coverage of violent demonstrations.”

u.s.-based acled is funded by the state department’s bureau of conflict and stabilization operations as well as foreign governments and other organizations, including the dutch ministry of foreign affairs, the german federal foreign office, the tableau foundation, the international organization for migration, and the university of texas at austin. it relied on data collection from the u.s. crisis monitor—a joint project led by acled and princeton university’s bridging divides initiative—that tracks and publishes real-time data on political violence and demonstrations in the u.s in order to “establish an evidence base from which to identify risks, hotspots and available resources to empower local communities in times of crisis.”

acled also highlights a “violent government response,” in which authorities “use force more often than not” when they are present at protests and that they “disproportionately used force while intervening in demonstrations associated with the blm movement, relative to other types of demonstrations.” the report also references “dozens of car-ramming attacks” on protesters by various individuals, some of whom have ties to hate groups like the ku klux klan.

acled warns in the report that the u.s. “is at heightened risk of political violence and instability going into the 2020 general election,” citing trends in mass shootings, violent hate crimes and police killings. the authors of the report say the trump administration has exacerbated tensions caused by racial inequality and police brutality. president donald trump and high-ranking members of his administration have frequently generalized protesters as violent anarchists.

(ap photo/rui vieira, file)

london (ap) — british prime minister boris johnson talked tough on sunday ahead of a crucial round of post-brexit trade talks with the european union, saying britain could walk away from the talks within weeks and insisting that a no-deal exit would be a “good outcome for the u.k.”

with talks deadlocked, johnson said an agreement would only be possible if eu negotiators are prepared to “rethink their current positions.”

the eu, in turn, accuses britain of failing to negotiate seriously.

britain left the now 27-nation eu on jan. 31, three-and-a-half years after the country narrowly voted to end more than four decades of membership. that political departure will be followed by an economic break when an 11-month transition period ends on dec. 31 and the u.k. leaves the eu’s single market and customs union.

without a deal, the new year will bring tariffs and other economic barriers between the u.k. and the bloc, its biggest trading partner. johnson said the country would “prosper mightily” even if britain had “a trading arrangement with the eu like australia’s” — the u.k. government’s preferred description of a no-deal brexit.

british chief negotiator david frost and his eu counterpart michel barnier are due to meet in london starting tuesday for their eighth round of negotiations.

barnier said last week he was “worried and disappointed” by the lack of progress and said the u.k. had not “engaged constructively.”

the key sticking points are european boats’ access to u.k. fishing waters and state aid to industries. the eu is determined to ensure a “level playing field” for competition so british firms can’t undercut the bloc’s environmental or workplace standards or pump public money into u.k. industries.

britain accuses the bloc of making demands that it has not imposed on other countries it has free trade deals with, such as canada.

frost told the mail on sunday newspaper that britain was “not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws.”

“we are not going to accept level playing field provisions that lock us in to the way the eu do things,” he said.

in another sign of potential trouble ahead, the financial times reported that johnson’s government was planning domestic legislation that would water down commitments to maintaining an open border between the u.k.’s northern ireland and eu member ireland that it has already signed up to. the border guarantee was a key part of the legally binding divorce agreement made between britain and the bloc last year.

british brexit supporters hate the agreement because it means keeping northern ireland aligned to some eu rules and regulations. but any move to undermine it would infuriate the eu and threaten the trade talks.

“this would be a very unwise way to proceed,” tweeted irish foreign minister simon coveney.

the british government said it was working “in good faith” to implement the agreed border provisions but was “considering fallback options in the event this is not achieved.”

the eu says a deal has to be struck before november to allow time for parliamentary approval and legal vetting before the transition period expires.

johnson gave an even shorter deadline in remarks he’s due to deliver on monday, saying an agreement needed to be sealed by an eu summit scheduled for oct. 15.

“if we can’t agree by then, then i do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on,” he said in the comments, which were released in advance by his office.

without a deal, british freight firms have warned there could be logjams at ports and supplies of key goods in britain could be “severely disrupted” starting jan. 1.

french foreign minister jean-yves le drian said sunday that talks were “not going well” and dismissed british attempts to drive a wedge between eu nations on issues such as fishing. le drian said the 27 nations remained united.

“we would prefer a deal, but a deal on the basis of our mandate,” he told france inter radio. “there is room for action, but the whole package, including the fishing package, needs to be taken up in order to avoid a ‘no deal.’”

"Trump hired Obama lookalike he 'ritualistically belittled' and fired in video stunt, says Michael Cohen in new book",234,inqhx7,https://www.businessinsider.com/cohen-trump-hired-obama-lookalike-to-humiliate-in-video-2020-9,20,1599443491.0,,"extracts from michael cohen's new memoir allege that trump was consumed by an obsessive hatred for barack obama, the us' first black president.

in one bizarre incident, trump hired an obama lookalike and ""ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him"" in a video, writes cohen.

the video was reportedly scheduled to air at the rnc convention but was scrapped by party bosses, according to reports at the time.

in the book cohen describes trump as a ""racist"" and a ""con man"" who claimed, groundlessly, that obama owed his places at columbia and harvard to “f---ing affirmative action.”

in a statement the white house attacked cohen's credibility, describing him as ""a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer.""

cohen was jailed in 2019 for lying to congress about trump's alleged business dealings with russia, and role in paying off women who claimed to have had affairs with trump.

visit business insider's homepage for more stories.

michael cohen, donald trump's former personal attorney, has described his ex-boss' obsessive hatred of president barack obama in extracts from his upcoming memoir published by news outlets saturday.

in an extract of cohen's ""disloyalty: a memoir,"" published by cnn and the washington post, cohen claims that trump described obama as a ""manchurian candidate"" who owed his place at columbia university and harvard law school to ""f---ing affirmative action.""

according to the cnn extract, trump, in pursuing his grudge against obama, hired a lookalike ""fauxbama"" and ""ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him"" in a bizarre video.

in the book, reports cnn, cohen does not name the man hired to play obama or say on what date the incident took place, but does include a picture from the video.

it shows trump sitting across his trump tower desk from a man resembling obama. on the desk in front of trump are two books, one with obama's name on the front.

but a copy of the video has emerged online

a parody of trump's hit reality show the apprentice, it was supposed to be aired at the 2013 rnc convention, according to reports, but was canned by party bosses.

in the video, published by breitbart in 2013, trump attacks the obama lookalike's record as president, his lack of business experience, and his golf game. it ends with trump hurling his ""you're fired"" apprentice catchphrase at obama and banishing him from his office.

""they never put it on,"" trump told breitbart of the rnc decision not to air the video at the time. ""the reason they didn't put it on is because they thought it was too controversial. controversy. it might not be politically correct.""

cohen, in extracts of the book published by the post, details several racist diatribes by trump. cohen claims that when ranting about obama in one incident, he went on to say, ""tell me one country run by a black person that isn't a s---hole. they are all complete f---ing toilets.""

according to the extracts, trump belittled minority voters, saying, ""i will never get the hispanic vote. like the blacks, they're too stupid to vote for trump.""

he also, writes cohen, insulted south african leader nelson mandela, and praised the racist apartheid regime.

""mandela f---ed the whole country up. now it's a s---hole. f--- mandela. he was no leader,"" cohen claims trump said.

in the book, cohen's assessment of his former boss's character is withering, and he describes him as ""a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.""

but the white house has hit back at cohen, who was jailed last year for lying to congress and for election finance crimes prosecutors claimed were committed at trump's behest.

in a statement to the post, the white house attacked cohen's credibility, describing him as ""a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to congress. he has lost all credibility, and it's unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies.""

but cohen is not the first source to have claimed that trump is consumed by hatred for obama.

trump launched his political career with the racist ""birther"" conspiracy theory, claiming, groundlessly, that obama was ineligible for the presidency because he wasn't born in the us. (obama was born in the us state of hawaii.)

in a notorious incident at the 2011 white house correspondents dinner, obama singled out trump in the audience and mocked him. some pundits have speculated the public humiliation was a key factor in trump's decision to run for the presidency in 2016."
Typhoon lashes South Korea after battering Japanese islands,131,io7gfn,https://apnews.com/a9c43e1d06d0d4c48b0e13dc2b0a772d,5,1599514213.0,,"a coastal road is damaged in ulsan, south korea, monday, sept. 7, 2020. a powerful typhoon damaged buildings, flooded roads and knocked out power to thousands of homes in south korea on monday after battering islands in southern japan and injuring dozens of people.

seoul, south korea (ap) — a powerful typhoon damaged buildings, flooded roads and knocked out power to thousands of homes in south korea on monday after battering islands in southern japan, killing one person and injuring dozens of others, before weakening as it passed north korea.

the korea meteorological administration downgraded typhoon haishen to a tropical storm monday night as it made landfall near the north korean coastal city of hamhung. during its period as a typhoon, haishen packed maximum winds of about 130 kilometers (80 miles) per hour as it barreled through south korea’s southern and eastern regions in the morning.

japanese disaster management officials in kagoshima said a woman in her 70s died of a head injury after falling into a roadside ditch while evacuating from a coastal town as haishen lashed southwestern japan over the weekend with strong winds and rain. japan’s fire and disaster management agency said at least 38 other people were injured, five of them seriously. schools and department stores were closed in hiroshima and other cities in the country’s southwest.

damage caused by the typhoon was less than feared because it took a path farther from the coast and weakened more quickly than expected, officials said.

in south korea, at least two people were missing — one after getting swept away by water in a drainage channel at a limestone mine in the eastern town of samcheok and the other while trying to cross a small river on a tractor in the southeastern town of uljin.

at least five people were hurt, including one in busan who sustained light injuries after a car flipped over in strong winds, the ministry of the interior and safety said.

at least 110 homes were destroyed or flooded, while cars struggled to navigate flooded roads in ulsan and other coastal cities such as busan, sokcho and gangneung. emergency workers scrambled to clean up toppled trees and damaged traffic signs, buildings, port facilities and other structures.

the storm also destroyed or sank around 80 fishing boats, and caused generating turbines at two nuclear reactors in the southeastern city of gyeongju to automatically stop. no leakage of radioactive materials was detected.

hundreds of flights in and out of the southern island province of jeju and across the mainland were canceled. some bridges and railroad sections were shut down, thousands of fishing boats and other vessels were moved to safety, and more than 3,000 residents in the southern mainland regions were evacuated due to the possibility of landslides and other concerns.

workers by monday evening completed restoring power to 75,237 households that lost electricity in the southern mainland areas and jeju.

haishen, which means “sea god” in chinese, plowed through okinawa and other southern japanese islands over the weekend. traffic was still paralyzed in places, bullet train service was suspended and most domestic flights in and out of airports in southwestern japan were canceled monday.

regional officials in miyazaki said rescue workers were looking for four people missing after a mudslide hit the mountainous village of shiiba earlier monday. a fifth person who was rescued at the site was seriously injured.

electricity was restored to thousands of homes in japan, but more than 340,000 others were still without power. nearly 4 million people in japan were still advised to evacuate as of monday afternoon.

the storm by late monday was expected to reach north korea’s northeastern region, which was battered by typhoon maysak last week, inflicting further pain on an economy ravaged by u.s.-led sanctions, border closures from the coronavirus pandemic and chronic food shortages.

north korean tv aired video of widespread flooding in the eastern coastal city of wonsan and nearby tongchon, but the country’s state media didn’t immediately report any casualties caused by haishen.

the north’s state media earlier said leader kim jong un visited typhoon-stricken areas, fired a top regional official for poor readiness, and promised to send 12,000 workers from pyongyang to help with recovery efforts. the north said maysak destroyed more than 1,000 houses and inundated public buildings and farmland.

maysak damaged roads and buildings and left at least one person dead in south korea. in addition, a livestock cargo ship sank off japan’s coast as maysak passed. two of its 43 crew members were rescued and one body was recovered before the search was halted because of haishen. an aerial search resumed later monday after haishen passed the area. the ship was transporting 5,800 cows from new zealand to china.

"Police break up scuffles between demonstrators, arrest two in Oregon's state capital",111,ioluws,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-protests-portland/police-break-up-scuffles-between-demonstrators-arrest-two-in-oregons-state-capital-idUSKBN25Y17P,25,1599562710.0,,"salem, ore. (reuters) - police broke up scuffles between supporters of president donald trump and black lives matter activists and arrested two people in salem, oregon, on monday as protests in the region turn increasingly violent.

more than 100 trump supporters, including members of the all-male, alt-right group the proud boys, came to the capitol building in salem, about 45 miles (72 km) south of portland, in a caravan of vehicles on monday afternoon, waving trump 2020 signs and american flags and some carrying weapons. they were met by about 20 black lives matter protesters.

the two groups fired pepper spray at each other, at least one trump supporter beat a black lives matter protester with a baseball bat and a trump supporter sprayed a fire extinguisher.

about two dozen state police officers were present and initially stood by as trump supporters charged and hit black lives matter protesters. police then tackled two people who had been punching black lives matter demonstrators and arrested them, according to a reuters witness.

in a statement, a spokesman for the oregon state police said officers with the state police and salem police department responded at the scene across from the capitol when an “american lives matter rally group” charged at counter protesters, chasing and pushing them.

two men were arrested, charged with misdemeanor assault and subsequently released, the spokesman said.

monday marked the 102nd day of protests in nearby portland. three months of nightly protests in the city and its surrounding area have at times turned violent, with demonstrators against racism and police brutality clashing with police officers and right-wing groups.

the demonstrations began, like others across the united states, following the death in may of george floyd, a black man who died under the knee of a white minneapolis police officer.

trump, who has made law and order the main theme of his bid for re-election on nov. 3, has singled out portland as one of several democratic-led cities he calls “anarchist jurisdictions.”

his democratic challenger, former vice president joe biden, says trump’s rhetoric is stoking the violence.

escalating tensions

the trump supporters started their afternoon on monday at a rally in oregon city, with families playing loud music and vendors selling trump merchandise.

at the same time, in portland’s cathedral park, hundreds of black lives matter activists participated in a “solidarity march” with a lineup of musicians and speakers, according to video on twitter.

in recent weeks, tensions have escalated in portland between trump supporters, including those who align themselves with the pro-gun, pro-trump group patriot prayer, and left-wing, self-described “anti-fascist” protesters.

the clashes resulted in the shooting death of a right-wing protester, 39-year-old aaron danielson, on aug. 29. federal agents later fatally shot a suspect in the killing, michael reinoehl, while trying to arrest him.

the u.s. justice department on friday directly linked reinoehl to the left-wing antifa movement, the first time it had drawn such a connection for a demonstrator facing federal charges in portland.

antifa is a largely unstructured movement whose followers broadly aim to confront those they view as authoritarian or racist.

police arrested 15 people in portland after protests near a police precinct overnight on sunday. on saturday night, the 100th day of protests, police arrested more than 50 people and used tear gas to disperse protesters who threw fire bombs."
How Trump’s Billion-Dollar Campaign Lost Its Cash Advantage,42,iovspa,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-campaign-fundraising.html,26,1599608230.0,,"money was supposed to have been one of the great advantages of incumbency for president trump, much as it was for president barack obama in 2012 and george w. bush in 2004. after getting outspent in 2016, mr. trump filed for re-election on the day of his inauguration — earlier than any other modern president — betting that the head start would deliver him a decisive financial advantage this year.

it seemed to have worked. his rival, joseph r. biden jr., was relatively broke when he emerged as the presumptive democratic nominee this spring, and mr. trump and the republican national committee had a nearly $200 million cash advantage.

five months later, mr. trump’s financial supremacy has evaporated. of the $1.1 billon his campaign and the party raised from the beginning of 2019 through july, more than $800 million has already been spent. now some people inside the campaign are forecasting what was once unthinkable: a cash crunch with less than 60 days until the election, according to republican officials briefed on the matter.

brad parscale, the former campaign manager, liked to call mr. trump’s re-election war machine an “unstoppable juggernaut.” but interviews with more than a dozen current and former campaign aides and trump allies, and a review of thousands of items in federal campaign filings, show that the president’s campaign and the r.n.c. developed some profligate habits as they burned through hundreds of millions of dollars. since bill stepien replaced mr. parscale in july, the campaign has imposed a series of belt-tightening measures that have reshaped initiatives, including hiring practices, travel and the advertising budget."
DHS draft document: White supremacists are greatest terror threat,331,iowrrf,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/04/white-supremacists-terror-threat-dhs-409236,112,1599611282.0,,"russia “probably will be the primary covert foreign influence actor and purveyor of disinformation and misinformation in the homeland,” the documents also say.

former acting dhs sec. kevin mcaleenan last year directed the department to start producing annual homeland threat assessments. politico reviewed three drafts of this year’s report — titled dhs’s state of the homeland threat assessment 2020 — all of which were produced in august. ben wittes, the editor in chief of the national security site lawfare, obtained the documents and shared them with politico. the first such assessment has not been released publicly, and a dhs spokesperson declined to comment on “allegedly leaked documents,” and on when the document will be made public.

none of the drafts politico reviewed referred to a threat from antifa, the loose cohort of militant left-leaning agitators who senior trump administration officials have described as domestic terrorists. two of the drafts refer to extremists trying to exploit the “social grievances” driving lawful protests.

the cut-off date for information analyzed in the earliest draft is august 3, 2020, while the cut-off date for the next two is august 27.

john cohen, who oversaw dhs’s counterterrorism portfolio from 2011 to 2014, said the drafts’ conclusion isn’t surprising.

“this draft document seems to be consistent with earlier intelligence reports from dhs, the fbi, and other law enforcement sources: that the most significant terror-related threat facing the us today comes from violent extremists who are motivated by white supremacy and other far-right ideological causes,” he said.

wittes, meanwhile, said the change in language on white supremacist terrorism is significant.

“it diminishes the prominence of white supremacy relative to other domestic violent extremism, and, without being inaccurate, puts it in a basket along with other violent activity that may be more palatable for the administration to acknowledge,” he said.

the threat from white supremacists

the earliest draft has the strongest language on the threat from white supremacists, in an introductory section labeled “key takeaways.”

“lone offenders and small cells of individuals motivated by a diverse array of social, ideological, and personal factors will pose the primary terrorist threat to the united states,” the draft reads. “among these groups, we assess that white supremacist extremists – who increasingly are networking with likeminded persons abroad – will pose the most persistent and lethal threat.”

the “key takeaways” section of the next two drafts calls “domestic violent extremists” the “most persistent and lethal threat,” rather than specifically naming white supremacists.

the document discusses white supremacists in greater detail when introducing the section titled “the terrorist threat to the homeland.” once again, language in the earliest draft is slightly stronger than the language in the subsequent drafts. the earliest draft introduces the threat from terrorism this way:

“we judge that ideologically-motivated lone offenders and small groups will pose the greatest terrorist threat to the homeland through 2021, with white supremacist extremists presenting the most lethal threat,” it reads.

the next two drafts refer to “domestic violent extremists” –– rather than “white supremacist extremists” –– as “the most persistent and lethal threat.” all three drafts contain the following sentence further down in the same section: “among dves [domestic violent extremists], we judge that white supremacist extremists (wses) will remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland through 2021.”

the second two drafts, meanwhile, allude to violent agitators who have been present at nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.

“violent extremists almost certainly will continue their efforts to exploit public fears associated with covid-19 and social grievances driving lawful protests to incite violence, intimidate targets, and promote their violent extremist ideologies,” the second and third drafts reviewed by politico say. “simple tactics – such as vehicle ramming, small arms, edged weapons, arson, and rudimentary improvised explosive devices – probably will be most common.”

all three documents note that 2019 was the most deadly year for domestic violent extremists since the oklahoma city bombing in 1995.

“among dve [domestic violent extremist] actors, wses [white supremacist extremists] conducted half of all lethal attacks (8 of 16), resulting in the majority of deaths (39 of 48),” the drafts read.

the assessment comes as dhs has faced scrutiny for its response to increasingly violent domestic extremism during the trump era. top dhs officials have spent years grappling with how to do more to combat the threat, and long chafed at what they called disinterest from the white house. two former top dhs political appointees told politico last month that white house national security officials shied away from addressing the problem and didn’t want to refer to killings by right-wing extremists as domestic terrorism.

but two former dhs chiefs both tried to make the burgeoning threat a priority for the department. as dhs secretary, kirstjen nielsen pushed then-national security adviser john bolton to make domestic terrorism a focus of the administration’s counterterrorism strategy. and then-acting sec. kevin mcaleenan also worked to highlight the threat, lobbying congress to spend more on efforts to prevent radicalization.

current dhs leaders also have acknowledged the lethality of white supremacist extremists.

“i have no qualms criticizing the white supremacy threat,” said ken cuccinelli, dhs’s second-in-command, in a recent interview on msnbc. “neither does the secretary, neither does the department of homeland security. we recognize when those people act out violently, that they show the highest level of lethality, meaning if you compare the number of violent incidents to the numbers of deaths, the numbers of deaths relative to the incidents is very high compared to other types of threats.""

dhs leaders have been much more vocal of late in highlighting federal efforts to target antifa. in a recent fox news interview, host tucker carlson asked acting dhs sec. chad wolf why the justice department hadn’t arrested and charged the leaders of antifa and black lives matter. “this is something i’ve talked to the ag personally about, and i know that they are working on it,” he replied.

and attorney general bill barr has zeroed in on the group in the context of the federal law enforcement response to long-running vandalism, violence, and unrest in portland, oregon. after u.s. marshals killed a murder suspect, michael reinoehl, who had described himself online as “100% antifa,” barr touted the operation as a success. the suspect tried to escape arrest and “produced a firearm,” according to a statement from barr.

“the tracking down of reinoehl — a dangerous fugitive, admitted antifa member, and suspected murderer — is a significant accomplishment in the ongoing effort to restore law and order to portland and other cities,” barr said."
"Trump claims environmental progress, but he's weakened rules",32,ioxz26,https://apnews.com/c984829ef78b964cc7d09bf2e0e1ab34,6,1599615003.0,,"president donald trump reacts to the crowd as he arrives to speak at a campaign rally at smith reynolds airport, tuesday, sept. 8, 2020, in winston-salem, n.c.

jupiter, fla. (ap) — president donald trump expanded a ban on new offshore drilling tuesday, an election-year reversal likely to appeal to voters in florida and other coastal states. two years ago, trump had taken steps to vastly expand offshore drilling from coast to coast.

“this protects your beautiful gulf and your beautiful ocean, and it will for a long time to come,” trump said as he announced the expanded drilling ban during an appearance at the jupiter inlet lighthouse.

the president signed a memorandum instructing the interior secretary to prohibit drilling in the waters off both florida coasts, and off the coasts of georgia and south carolina for a period of 10 years — from july 1, 2022, to june 20, 2032.

the existing moratorium covers the gulf of mexico, and trump said the new one would also cover the atlantic coast — a significant political concern in coastal states like florida.

trump used the event to portray himself as an environmental steward and contrast his record against that of democrat joe biden. but the trump administration has overturned or weakened numerous regulations meant to protect air and water quality and lands essential for imperiled species.

the trip comes as trump steps up his travel to battleground states eight week before the election. from florida, he headed for a campaign rally in north carolina, another must-win for his reelection, before returning to the white house late tuesday.

trump used the north carolina stop to campaign against the state’s restrictive coronavirus guidelines, as he openly flouted the 50-person cap on outdoor events with a rally of thousands of supporters standing shoulder-to-shoulder on an airport tarmac.

“your state should be open,” trump said, baselessly claiming that democratic gov. roy cooper and others were trying to hamstring their economies with restrictions to hurt his reelection. “it’s a shame what’s going on, and i’ll tell you what, on nov. 4, every one of those states will be open. they’re doing it for political reasons.”

back in florida, trump used the taxpayer-funded event to lambaste his opponent with claims that biden would “destroy america’s middle class” and give a “free pass to the world’s worst foreign polluters.”

biden has called for eliminating carbon emissions from power plants by 2035 and modernizing the electric grid. both moves would curtail fossil fuel demand. his plan also includes significant direct public spending and tax subsidies for other energy sources, which biden’s campaign says would spur new jobs even as traditional energy jobs wane.

biden calls out china as the world’s biggest coal polluter and says he’d hinge all future trade deals with beijing on carbon reductions. he supports an international alliance to help other nations afford low-carbon development and pitches a global moratorium on arctic offshore drilling.

the announcement could open trump to charges of an election-year flip-flop given that in january 2018 he acted to vastly expand offshore drilling from the atlantic to the arctic oceans and he has supported efforts to boost american energy production to lessen reliance on foreign sources.

biden accused trump of “conveniently” changing his mind.

“just months ago, donald trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of florida,” biden tweeted. “now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. unbelievable. you don’t have to guess where i stand: i oppose new offshore drilling.”

trump offered himself as the greatest environmental president since theodore roosevelt.

“who would have thought? trump is the great environmentalist,” the president said. “you hear that? that’s good, and i am. i am. i believe strongly in it.”

but trump has rolled back numerous regulations designed to protect the environment, from power plant emissions to auto fuel standards to clean water. he withdrew the u.s. from the paris climate accord, a global agreement to address the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

the environment has also been the primary target of trump’s push to eliminate regulations, eliminating or weakening dozens of rules that protect the air and water, along with lands essential for imperiled species while reversing obama-era initiatives to fight climate change.

trump replaced obama’s clean power plan aimed at slashing greenhouse gas pollution from electric plants and eased automobile fuel economy standards. under trump, the environmental protection agency stripped federal protection from millions of acres of streams and wetlands. he lifted restrictions on oil and gas exploration in sensitive areas and shortened environmental reviews of construction projects such as highways and pipelines.

south carolina gov. henry mcmaster, a longtime trump ally who has opposed the administration’s drilling exploration expansion plans, applauded tuesday’s announcement as “good news” but warned “we must remain vigilant in the conservation and preservation of our coastline.”

trump said he had also been discussing the moratorium with florida gov. ron desantis, who greeted trump at the airport in west palm beach and attended the jupiter event. about 200 people attended. few wore face coverings or practiced social distancing.

jaclyn lopez, florida director for the center for biological diversity action fund, said floridians will remember it was trump who previously proposed opening the state to drilling in the first place.

“voters shouldn’t be duped by this cheap, last-minute maneuver,” lopez said in an emailed statement. “it can’t even begin to make up for the aggressive efforts to expand dirty offshore drilling since trump’s been in office.”

energy industry groups said the decision was the “wrong approach” for the times.

“offshore access is critical for growing u.s. energy leadership and providing affordable energy for american families,” said lem smith, vice president of upstream policy at the american petroleum institute, in an emailed statement. the ban “puts at risk hundreds of thousands of new jobs, u.s. energy security advancements and billions of dollars in critical revenue for states,” he added.

after new york state courts turned down trump’s request to delay e. jean carroll’s suit, justice department lawyers filed court papers aiming to shift the case into federal court and to substitute the u.s. for trump as the defendant. that means the federal government, rather than trump himself, might have to pay damages if any are awarded.

the move to intervene is in keeping with a justice department that time and again has advanced a broad vision of executive power and has moved to shield trump from legal exposure, most notably by arguing that actions taken to choke off the russia investigation fell within the scope of his constitutional authorities and were therefore permissible.

it also comes amid concerns that attorney general william barr has gone out of his way to intervene in other legal cases involving trump or his allies. barr tried to decrease the amount of prison time his office sought for trump ally roger stone following a criminal trial where he was found guilty. (stone’s sentence was later commuted by trump.) barr’s justice department has acted to dismiss its own case against former national security adviser michael flynn .

carroll’s lawyer, roberta kaplan, called the department’s argument “shocking.”

“it offends me as a lawyer and offends me even more as a citizen,” she said in a statement.

carroll said the developments illustrated “that trump will do everything possible, including using the full powers of the federal government,” to try to stop the case.

and in a tweet addressed to trump, carroll wrote: “sir, i and my attorney robbie kaplan, are ready! so is every woman who has ever been silenced! so is every american citizen who has been trampled by bill barr and the doj! bring it!”

the filing complicates, at least for the moment, carroll’s efforts to get a dna sample from the president as potential evidence and to have him answer questions under oath.

justice department lawyers argue that trump was “acting within the scope of his office” when he denied carroll’s allegations, made last year, that he raped her in a new york luxury department store in the mid-1990s. she says his comments — including that she was “totally lying” to sell a memoir — besmirched her character and harmed her career.

“numerous courts have recognized that elected officials act within the scope of their office or employment when speaking with the press, including with respect to personal matters,” the justice attorneys wrote.

it will be up to a federal judge to decide whether to move the case to federal court from state court and to allow the u.s. to become the defendant.

carroll is trying to get a dna sample from trump to see whether it matches as-yet-unidentified male genetic material found on a dress that she says she was wearing during the alleged attack and didn’t don again until a photo shoot last year.

her suit seeks damages and a retraction of trump’s statements.

Trump's ex-lawyer Cohen links Falwell’s endorsement in 2016 to suppression of racy photos,203,ipci0w,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-falwell-endorsement/trumps-ex-lawyer-cohen-links-falwells-endorsement-in-2016-to-suppression-of-racy-photos-idUSKBN25Z2S0,48,1599671171.0,,"washington (reuters) - in his book released today, michael cohen, the former fixer for u.s. president donald trump, ties for the first time the 2016 presidential endorsement of trump by american evangelical leader jerry falwell jr to cohen’s own role in helping to keep racy “personal” photographs of the falwells from becoming public.

as reuters reported last year, the falwells enlisted cohen to keep “a bunch of photographs, personal photographs” from becoming public, cohen said in a recording, made surreptitiously by comedian tom arnold. “i actually have one of the photos,” he said, without going into specifics. “it’s terrible.”

in “disloyal: the memoir,” cohen describes thinking that his involvement in the falwell photo matter would be a “catch and kill” -- the practice of american tabloids to obtain and then suppress unfavorable stories about celebrities -- “but in this case it was just going to be kill.”

he later writes: “in good time, i would call in this favor, not for me, but for the boss, at a crucial moment on his journey to the presidency.”

cohen has said that he helped persuade falwell to endorse trump just before republican voters gathered in iowa in february 2016 to nominate a presidential candidate. falwell not only publicly vouched for trump’s christian virtues but also barnstormed with the candidate. his backing of trump -- a twice-divorced candidate who had talked about grabbing women’s genitals and engaged in extramarital affairs -- was one of the major surprises of the 2016 campaign.

in the book, cohen doesn’t explicitly say that the endorsement was the favor he sought in return for his help in having kept the falwell photos from getting out. but his account marks the first time he has linked the two issues.

earlier this year, cohen was quoted by cnn saying “there is absolutely no connection between the photos and my personal request to the falwells to assist the trump campaign.” how that comment jibes with what he’s written in his book is unclear. cohen did not immediately respond to efforts by reuters to reach him.

after this story was published, jerry falwell spoke by phone with reuters. he said that “someone stole some pictures i took of my wife in the back yard. topless. big deal. ok?” but he said his endorsement of trump had nothing to do with cohen’s role in suppressing the racy photographs.

“it was no quid pro quo,” falwell said. “there was no me supporting trump because of whatever michael was doing.”

falwell said he endorsed trump, at cohen’s behest, because falwell “believed that a businessman needed to run this country.”

toward the end of the call, becki falwell, who has not commented on the cohen book or the photographs, could be heard urging her husband to cut short the conversation with reuters. “hang up the goddamn phone,” she told her husband. “hang up the phone, jerry!”

the white house dismissed cohen’s account.

“michael cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to congress. he has lost all credibility, and it’s unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies,” press secretary kayleigh mcenany told reuters.

cohen, who was convicted of campaign finance violations and other crimes, is serving the remainder of his three-year term in home confinement.

falwell, who at the time of the 2016 endorsement ran liberty university, stepped down as president of liberty late last month after reuters reported that a business associate alleged a years-long affair with jerry and becki falwell.

that associate, giancarlo granda, told reuters the relationship involved him having sex with becki falwell while jerry falwell watched. jerry falwell has denied involvement, saying the sexual relationship was between his wife and granda only.

falwell’s departure from liberty marked a dramatic fall for one of the most powerful figures in america’s evangelical christian movement. he was widely credited with helping persuade many christians concerned about trump’s past to accept him as a repentant sinner.

in his book, cohen writes that he had become close to the falwells in 2011, once securing tickets for one of their daughters to see justin bieber perform. he calls the falwells “dear friends, more like family to me.”

but he also makes clear that, as in the smaller assistance in securing the bieber tickets, he saw the help he offered the falwells in the photo matter as transactional -- and enormously significant.

“like the bieber favor a few years earlier, this would have a huge impact on the 2016 election, evangelicals, the supreme court and the fate of the nation,” cohen writes.

“if becki falwell was seen half-naked by the students of liberty university, let alone evangelicals all over the country, it would be an unmitigated disaster,” he writes.

after succeeding at keeping the photos from being released, cohen writes that he “called becki and reassured her that the pictures wouldn’t get out, but i could hear the fear and sadness in her voice. i reassured her i wouldn’t let her down, and i didn’t.”

“there it was: my second chit with the falwells,” he writes. “in good time, i would call in this favor, not for me, but for the boss, at a crucial moment on his journey to the presidency.”"
"Norwegian lawmaker says Trump 'should be awarded' Nobel Peace Prize for Israel, UAE agreement",1,ipgnvk,https://tiny.iavian.net/13kr1,5,1599689715.0,[deleted],"a norwegian lawmaker has nominated president trump for the 2021 nobel peace prize for his role in brokering a historic peace deal between israel and the united arab emirates last month.

christian tybring-gjedde, a lawmaker with the populist progress party, told the ""fox news rundown"" podcast wednesday that trump ""should be awarded"" for the groundbreaking agreement, which normalizes relations between the two countries following what gjedde characterized as ""hostile conditions for as long as you can remember.""

gjedde likened the agreement -- known as the abraham accord -- to the 1978 camp david accords between israel and egypt and the oslo accords of the 1990s between israel and the plo. in both instances, the parties to those agreements received the nobel peace prize -- with anwar sadat and menachem begin receiving the honors in 1978 and yasser arafat, shimon peres and yitzhak rabin collecting the prize in 1994.

""that is a very, very important region in the world,"" gjedde said. ""and all efforts that lead to peace in that region should be awarded with the nobel peace prize and also for donald j. trump.""

trump announces historic peace agreement between israel, uae

gjedde previously nominated trump for the peace prize in 2018 after the singapore summit with north korean leader kim jong un, which the norwegian maintains was an ""honorable"" achievement.

nominations for the 2021 nobel peace prize must be sent to the norwegian nobel committee before jan. 31. names of the nominees and other information about the nominations are not made public for another 50 years.

a total of 21 americans have received the nobel peace prize. the most recent recipient from the u.s. was president barack obama in 2009, a decision that gjedde said ""surprised"" him.

""i think the peace prize was given to obama because the nobel peace committee leader was very flattered and also very impressed by obama's speeches and how he behaved during his first month in office as a president,"" gjedde said.

""also, he was the first black president. this was also an achievement in itself. i think that's what the nobel peace prize committee considered. but i think that is not what the peace prize committee should consider,"" added gjedde who said the committee should focus on ""achievements, not any other criteria.""

"Ben Sasse: Senator Calls for Repealing 17th Amendment, Eliminating Popular-Vote Senate Elections",67,iphfy0,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/ben-sasse-calls-for-repealing-17th-amendment-eliminating-popular-vote-senate-elections/,168,1599692252.0,,"senator ben sasse speaks during a senate judiciary committee business meeting on capitol hill in washington, d.c., june 11, 2020. ( erin schaff/reuters)

senator ben sasse (r., neb.) called to repeal the 17th amendment on tuesday, which would eliminate the requirement that u.s. senators be elected by popular votes.

in a wall street journal op-ed titled “make the senate great again,” sasse called for an end to the amendment, among other changes to the senate “aimed at promoting debate, not ending it.”

advertisement

he also recommended abolishing standing committees, requiring senators to show up for debates, implementing 12-year term limits, and requiring senators to live together in dorms when in washington.

“what would the founding fathers think of america if they came back to life?” sasse wrote. “their eyes would surely bug out first at our technology and wealth. but i suspect they’d also be stunned by the deformed structure of our government. the congress they envisioned is all but dead. the senate in particular is supposed to be the place where americans hammer out our biggest challenges with debate. that hasn’t happened for decades—and the rot is bipartisan.”

before the 17th amendment was ratified in 1913, article i of the constitution mandated that each state legislature vote to send two senators to washington. sasse argues that returning control to state legislatures would be a way of increasing local control in the senate in a time of polarization and nationalization in politics.

“different states bring different solutions to the table, and that ought to be reflected in the senate’s national debate,” he wrote. “the old saying used to be that all politics is local, but today—thanks to the internet, 24/7 cable news and a cottage industry dedicated to political addiction—politics is polarized and national. that would change if state legislatures had direct control over who serves in the senate.”

the nebraskan senator also suggested ridding the senate of cameras because in the presence of cameras, senators “aren’t trying to learn from witnesses, uncover details, or improve legislation. they’re competing for sound bites.“

“without posturing for cameras, republicans and democrats cooperate on some of america’s most complicated and urgent problems,” he wrote.

'Play it down': Trump admits to concealing the true threat of coronavirus in new Woodward book,434,ipjzsk,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/09/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump-coronavirus/index.html,125,1599699792.0,,"washington (cnn) president donald trump admitted he knew weeks before the first confirmed us coronavirus death that the virus was dangerous, airborne, highly contagious and ""more deadly than even your strenuous flus,"" and that he repeatedly played it down publicly, according to legendary journalist bob woodward in his new book ""rage.""

""this is deadly stuff,"" trump told woodward on february 7.

in a series of interviews with woodward, trump revealed that he had a surprising level of detail about the threat of the virus earlier than previously known. ""pretty amazing,"" trump told woodward, adding that the coronavirus was maybe five times ""more deadly"" than the flu.

trump's admissions are in stark contrast to his frequent public comments at the time insisting that the virus was ""going to disappear"" and ""all work out fine.""

the book, using trump's own words, depicts a president who has betrayed the public trust and the most fundamental responsibilities of his office. in ""rage,"" trump says the job of a president is ""to keep our country safe."" but in early february, trump told woodward he knew how deadly the virus was, and in march, admitted he kept that knowledge hidden from the public.

""i wanted to always play it down,"" trump told woodward on march 19, even as he had declared a national emergency over the virus days earlier. ""i still like playing it down, because i don't want to create a panic.""

if instead of playing down what he knew, trump had acted decisively in early february with a strict shutdown and a consistent message to wear masks, social distance and wash hands, experts believe that thousands of american lives could have been saved.

the startling revelations in ""rage,"" which cnn obtained ahead of its september 15 release, were made during 18 wide-ranging interviews trump gave woodward from december 5, 2019 to july 21, 2020. the interviews were recorded by woodward with trump's permission, and cnn has obtained copies of some of the audio tapes.

""rage"" also includes brutal assessments of trump's presidency from many of his former top national security officials, including former defense secretary james mattis, former director of national intelligence dan coats and former secretary of state rex tillerson. mattis is quoted as calling trump ""dangerous"" and ""unfit"" to be commander in chief. woodward writes that coats ""continued to harbor the secret belief, one that had grown rather than lessened, although unsupported by intelligence proof, that putin had something on trump."" woodward continues, writing that coats felt, ""how else to explain the president's behavior? coats could see no other explanation.""

in this white house photo from december 2019 provided by bob woodward, president donald trump is seen speaking to woodward in the oval office, surrounded by some aides and advisers, as well as vice president mike pence. on trump's desk is a large picture of trump and north korean leader kim jong un.

the book also contains harsh evaluations of the president's leadership on the virus from current officials.

dr. anthony fauci, the administration's top infectious disease expert, is quoted telling others trump's leadership was ""rudderless"" and that his ""attention span is like a minus number.""

""his sole purpose is to get reelected,"" fauci told an associate, according to woodward.

fauci responded to the quotes in a fox news interview on wednesday, saying he would question the account.

""if you notice, others have said that. you know, you should ask others. i don't recall that at all,"" fauci said, adding that he ""didn't get any sense"" trump was distorting things.

trump responded to the woodward book at a white house event wednesday afternoon, defending his response to the pandemic and confirming he did not want to create a panic.

""well, i think if you said in order to reduce panic, perhaps that's so,"" trump said. ""the fact is i'm a cheerleader for this country. i love our country. and i don't want people to be frightened. i don't want to create panic, as you say, and certainly i'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. we want to show confidence. we want to show strength.""

'the virus has nothing to do with me'

woodward reveals new details on the early warnings trump received -- and often ignored.

in a january 28 top secret intelligence briefing, national security adviser robert o'brien gave trump a ""jarring"" warning about the virus, telling the president it would be the ""biggest national security threat"" of his presidency. trump's head ""popped up,"" woodward writes.

o'brien's deputy, matt pottinger, concurred, telling trump it could be as bad as the influenza pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including 675,000 americans. pottinger warned trump that asymptomatic spread was occurring in china: he had been told 50% of those infected showed no symptoms.

at that time, there were fewer than a dozen reported coronavirus cases in the us.

three days later, trump announced restrictions on travel from china, a move suggested by his national security team -- despite trump's later claims that he alone backed the travel limitations.

nevertheless, trump continued to publicly downplay the danger of the virus. february was a lost month . woodward views this as a damning missed opportunity for trump to reset ""the leadership clock"" after he was told this was a ""once-in-a-lifetime health emergency.""

""presidents are the executive branch. there was a duty to warn. to listen, to plan, and to take care,"" woodward writes. but in the days following the january 28 briefing, trump used high-profile appearances to minimize the threat and, woodward writes, ""to reassure the public they faced little risk.""

during a pre-super bowl interview on fox news february 2, trump said, ""we pretty much shut it down coming in from china."" two days later during his state of the union address , trump made only a passing reference to the virus, promising, ""my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.""

asked by woodward in may if he remembered o'brien's january 28 warning that the virus would be the biggest national security threat of his presidency, trump equivocated. ""no, i don't."" trump said. ""i'm sure if he said it — you know, i'm sure he said it. nice guy.""

the book highlights how the president took all of the credit and none of the responsibility for his actions related to the pandemic, which has infected 6 million americans and killed more than 185,000 in the us.

""the virus has nothing to do with me,"" trump told woodward in their final interview in july. ""it's not my fault. it's — china let the damn virus out.""

'it goes through the air'

when woodward spoke to trump on february 7, two days after he was acquitted on impeachment charges by the senate, woodward expected a lengthy conversation about the trial. he was surprised, however, by the president's focus on the virus. at the same time that trump and his public health officials were saying the virus was ""low risk,"" trump divulged to woodward that the night before he'd spoken to chinese president xi jinping about the virus. woodward quotes trump as saying, ""we've got a little bit of an interesting setback with the virus going in china.""

""it goes through the air,"" trump said. ""that's always tougher than the touch. you don't have to touch things. right? but the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. and so that's a very tricky one. that's a very delicate one. it's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.""

but trump spent most of the next month saying that the virus was ""very much under control"" and that cases in the us would "" disappear ."" trump said on his trip to india on february 25 that it was ""a problem that's going to go away,"" and the next day he predicted the number of us cases ""within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.""

by march 19, when trump told woodward he was purposely downplaying the dangers to avoid creating a panic, he also acknowledged the threat to young people. ""just today and yesterday, some startling facts came out. it's not just old, older. young people too, plenty of young people,"" trump said.

publicly, however, trump has continued to insist just the opposite, saying as recently as august 5 that children were "" almost immune.

even into april, when the us became the country with the most confirmed cases in the world, trump's public statements contradicted his acknowledgements to woodward. at an april 3 coronavirus task force briefing, trump was still downplaying the virus and stating that it would go away. ""i said it's going away and it is going away,"" he said. yet two days later on april 5, trump again told woodward, ""it's a horrible thing. it's unbelievable,"" and on april 13, he said, ""it's so easily transmissible, you wouldn't even believe it.""

'dangerous' and 'unfit'

woodward, a two-time pulitzer prize winner, conducted hundreds of hours of confidential background interviews with firsthand witnesses for ""rage,"" and he obtained ""notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents,"" including more than two dozen letters trump exchanged with north korean leader kim jong un . woodward is known to record his interviews with the permission of his subjects and sources.

he writes that when he attributes exact quotations, thoughts or conclusions, that information comes either from the person, a colleague with direct knowledge or documents.

trump's conscious downplaying of the coronavirus is one of numerous revelations in ""rage."" the book is filled with anecdotes about top cabinet officials blindsided by tweets, frustrated with trump's inability to focus and scared about his next policy directive because he refused to accept facts or listen to experts:

-- mattis is quoted as saying trump is ""dangerous,"" ""unfit,"" has ""no moral compass"" and took foreign policy actions that showed adversaries ""how to destroy america."" after mattis left the administration, he and coats discussed whether they needed to take ""collective action"" to speak out publicly against trump. mattis says he ultimately resigned after trump announced he was withdrawing us troops from syria, ""when i was basically directed to do something that i thought went beyond stupid to felony stupid.""

-- woodward writes that coats and his top staff members ""examined the intelligence as carefully as possible,"" and that coats still questions the relationship between trump and russian president vladimir putin. ""coats saw how extraordinary it was for the president's top intelligence official to harbor such deep suspicions about the president's relationship with putin. but he could not shake them.""

-- trump has come under fire in recent days for reportedly making disparaging remarks about us military personnel and veterans. woodward's book includes an anecdote where an aide to mattis heard trump say in a meeting, ""my f---ing generals are a bunch of pussies"" because they cared more about alliances than trade deals. mattis asked the aide to document the comment in an email to him. and trump himself criticized military officials to woodward over their view that alliances with nato and south korea are the best bargain the us makes. ""i wouldn't say they were stupid, because i would never say that about our military people,"" trump said. ""but if they said that, they -- whoever said that was stupid. it's a horrible bargain ... they make so much money. costs us $10 billion. we're suckers.""

-- woodward reports that trump's national security team expressed concerns the us may have come close to nuclear war with north korea amid provocations in 2017. ""we never knew whether it was real,"" secretary of state mike pompeo is quoted as saying, ""or whether it was a bluff."" but it was so serious that mattis slept in his clothes to be ready in case there was a north korean launch and repeatedly went to the washington national cathedral to pray.

-- trump boasted to woodward about a new secret weapons system. ""i have built a nuclear — a weapons system that nobody's ever had in this country before,"" trump said. woodward says other sources confirmed the information, without providing further details, but expressed surprise that trump disclosed it.

-- woodward obtained the 27 ""love letters"" trump exchanged with kim jong un, 25 of which have not been reported publicly. the letters, filled with flowery language, provide a fascinating window into their relationship. kim flatters trump by repeatedly calling him ""your excellency,"" and writes in one letter that meeting again would be ""reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film."" in another, kim writes that the ""deep and special friendship between us will work as a magical force."" cnn has obtained the transcripts of two of the letters

-- trump's son-in-law and senior white house adviser jared kushner also weighs in with some unusual literary insights about his father-in-law. kushner is quoted as saying that four texts are key to understanding trump, including ""alice in wonderland."" kushner paraphrased the cheshire cat: ""if you don't know where you're going, any path will get you there.""

-- woodward pressed trump on saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman's role in the 2018 killing of journalist jamal khashoggi. once again, trump dismissed the us intelligence assessment and defends bin salman: ""he says very strongly that he didn't do it.""

-- trump insulted his predecessors, saying woodward made former president george w. bush ""look like a stupid moron, which he was."" trump said of former president barack obama: ""i don't think obama's smart ... i think he's highly overrated. and i don't think he's a great speaker."" he also tells woodward that kim jong un thought obama was an ""asshole.""

-- woodward discussed the black lives matter protests and suggested to the president that people like the two of them -- ""white, privileged"" -- need to work to understand the anger and pain that black people feel in the us. ""you really drank the kool-aid, didn't you? just listen to you,"" trump responded, repeating his outrageous talking point that he's done more for the black community than any president besides abraham lincoln.

-- woodward reports new details on russia's election meddling, writing that the nsa and cia have classified evidence the russians had placed malware in the election registration systems of at least two florida counties, st. lucie and washington. while there was no evidence the malware had been activated, woodward writes, it was sophisticated and could erase voters in specific districts. the voting system vendor used by florida was also used in states across the country.

'dynamite behind the door'

""rage"" is a follow-up to woodward's 2018 bestselling book ""fear,"" which portrayed a chaotic white house in which aides hid papers from trump to protect the country from what they viewed as his most dangerous impulses.

while trump slammed ""fear,"" he also complained that he didn't speak to woodward for the book, which resulted in his agreeing to extensive interviews for ""rage.""

however, on august 14, trump preemptively attacked woodward's new book, tweeting, ""the bob woodward book will be a fake, as always, just as many of the others have been.""

throughout the book, trump provides insights into his view of the presidency. he tells woodward when you're running the country, ""there's dynamite behind every door.""

after his 18 interviews, woodward issues a stark verdict: trump is the ""dynamite behind the door."" woodward concludes his book with a declaration that ""trump is the wrong man for the job.""

Far-right Norwegian politician nominates Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize,8,ipmgnu,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-nominated-2021-nobel-peace-prize-far-right-norwegian-politician/,10,1599706407.0,,"copenhagen, denmark — a far-right norwegian lawmaker said wednesday that he has nominated president donald trump for the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the middle east.

christian tybring-gjedde, a member of the norwegian parliament for the far-right progress party, said mr. trump should be considered because of his work ""for a peace agreement between the united arab emirates and israel which opens up for possible peace in the middle east.""

""no matter how trump acts at home and what he says at press conferences, he has absolutely a chance at getting the nobel peace prize,"" tybring-gjedde, told the associated press.

he said he nominated trump on wednesday, adding that ""donald trump meets the criteria"" for the nobel peace prize.

president trump retweeted a link to the jerusalem post's article about his nomination, saying simply, ""thank you!""

tybring-gjedde was also one of two norwegian lawmakers who nominated mr. trump for the peace prize in 2018 for his efforts to bring reconciliation between north and south korea.

tybring-gjedde's daughter mathilde, a member of parliament for the center-right conservative party, criticized the nomination in an email to cbs news.

""i did not nominate donald trump as i do not believe he is qualified to receive the nobel peace prize. the prize is given to those who have 'done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.' donald trump does not come to mind when i read this description,"" said mathilde tybring-gjedde.

any national lawmaker can nominate someone for the nobel peace prize.

the process of considering candidates, narrowing the wide field of nominees and awarding the prize is done in norway, in contrast to the other nobel prizes, which are awarded in neighboring sweden. nominations must be sent to the norwegian nobel committee by february 1.

the norwegian nobel committee doesn't publicly comment on nominees. under its rules, the information is required to be kept secret for 50 years.

the nobel committee says on its website that, as of wednesday, a total of 318 candidates have been put forward for the 2020 peace prize, of which 211 are individuals and 107 are organizations. that's the fourth-highest number of candidates ever, with the current record of 376 candidates reached in 2016.

""it is now to hope that the nobel committee is able to consider what trump has achieved internationally and that it does not stumble in established prejudice against the us president,"" christian tybring-gjedde said in a facebook post."
Fauci denies hearing Trump distort facts on coronavirus,0,iq2ppp,https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/09/09/anthony-fauci-trump-woodward-coronavirus-410895?__twitter_impression=true,19,1599771199.0,,"anthony fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, defended president donald trump on wednesday after audio recordings revealed that the president wanted to downplay the severity of the coronavirus early in the pandemic.

speaking with fox news’ john roberts, fauci denied that he ever heard the president “distort” the threat of the coronavirus and maintained that trump’s presentations to the public were largely in line with discussions he’d had with medical experts. when asked whether he ever felt trump was downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, fauci said no.

“i didn’t get any sense that he was distorting anything,” fauci said. “in my discussions with him, they were always straightforward about the concerns that we had. we related that to him. when he would go out, i’d hear him discussing the same sort of things.”

fauci’s comments come after washington post reporter bob woodward revealed that trump admitted to him in february that he thought the coronavirus situation was far more dangerous than he publicly presented. the post published recordings of woodward and trump’s conversations, which included the president saying that he wanted “to play it down” in order to avoid panic.

though trump acknowledged in his woodward interviews that he understood the severity of the disease, in subsequent public appearances, the president minimized its risks. he declined to don a face mask in public for months and often compared the disease to the flu. he encouraged opening up public spaces, and the u.s. has been an outlier among industrialized nations in the number of cases and deaths from the disease.

trump has defended his handling of the pandemic by repeatedly touting his travel ban on foreigners from china. but when asked whether he should take responsibility for the united states’ botched handling of the virus, the white house has refused.

despite defending trump, fauci largely avoided commenting directly on the woodward interviews on wednesday. he conceded that “it may have happened,” but added that woodward’s account revolves around discussions that didn’t involve him.

“i’m a small frame in the big picture of what goes on,” fauci said.

fauci also challenged woodward’s account that he had said the president was on “a separate channel” and had an attention span that was “like a minus number.” according to woodward’s account, fauci said trump’s “sole purpose is to get reelected.”

fauci disputed the quotes, saying they were from second-hand sources and not from him. he also said that the internecine drama was distracting from the work the coronavirus task force was doing to fight the pandemic.

“i don’t want to get involved in the kind of stuff that is distracting to the kind of things i’m trying to do and we’re all trying to do with this outbreak,” fauci told roberts.

fauci has had to balance his place in a white house particularly susceptible to personnel changes based on personal standing with the president. fauci has served at the national institutes of health under multiple presidents going back to ronald reagan and has consistently high trust among members of both parties. but rumors of clashes between the career public health official and a president who presents himself as a washington outsider have continued to simmer.

during a wednesday news briefing, white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany leaned heavily on fauci in her defense of the president.

“the president has never lied to the american public on covid,” she said. “the president was expressing calm and his actions reflect that. i’d refer you to dr. fauci, who said that this president had an impressive response. i can’t imagine under any circumstance that anyone could do anything more. that’s the record of this president.”

(ap photo/martin meissner)

berlin (ap) — streaming high-definition videos and games can result in significant greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the technology used, according to a german government-backed study released thursday.

the report published by germany’s federal environment agency calculated the amount of carbon dioxide produced by data centers where material is stored for streaming, and by the transmission technology used to get it to consumers.

it concluded that streaming video over fiber optic cables results in the lowest amount of co2 emissions — 2 grams per hour. using copper cables produces twice that amount, while 3g mobile technology results in a hefty 90 grams of co2 per hour.

the report’s authors said streaming over next-generation mobile technology, known as 5g, would result in carbon dioxide emissions of 5 grams per hour, suggesting that widespread rollout could help cut energy consumption.

data centers, meanwhile, accounted for only a small share of the overall energy use, though the amount varied significantly depending on how efficiently servers were used and cooled, according to the report.

christian stoll, am energy expert who wasn’t involved in the study, said the figures appeared plausible but noted that they didn’t take into account the amount of electricity consumed by the devices used to watch the streamed videos.

“(this) represent a significant part of the total emissions,” said stoll, a researcher at the technical university munich’s center for energy markets and the mit center for energy and environmental policy research.

presenting the report, german environment minister svenja schulze said the study was an attempt to help provide solid data for decision-makers as digital infrastructure becomes increasingly important at the same time as countries try to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that heat up the atmosphere.

“it is possible to stream data without negatively impacting the climate if you do it right and choose the right method for data transmission,” she said. “from an environmental perspective, it would be a good idea to set up more public wifi hotspots, as this is more climate-friendly than streaming in mobile networks.”"
World wildlife plummets more than two-thirds in 50 years: index,64,iq4crh,https://www.france24.com/en/20200909-world-wildlife-plummets-more-than-two-thirds-in-50-years-index,6,1599776944.0,,"advertising read more

paris (afp)

global animal, bird and fish populations have plummeted more than two-thirds in less than 50 years due to rampant over-consumption, experts said thursday in a stark warning to save nature in order to save ourselves.

human activity has severely degraded three quarters of all land and 40 percent of earth's oceans, and our quickening destruction of nature is likely to have untold consequences on our health and livelihoods.

the living planet index, which tracks more than 4,000 species of vertebrates, warned that increasing deforestation and agricultural expansion were the key drivers behind a 68 percent average decline in populations between 1970 and 2016.

it warned that continued natural habitat loss increased the risk of future pandemics as humans expand their presence into ever closer contact with wild animals.

2020's living planet report, a collaboration between wwf international and the zoological society of london, is the 13th edition of the biennial publication tracking wildlife populations around the world.

wwf international director general marco lambertini told afp of the staggering loss of earth's biodiversity since 1970.

""it's an accelerating decrease that we've been monitoring for 30 years and it continues to go in the wrong direction,"" he said.

""in 2016 we documented a 60 percent decline, now we have a 70 percent decline.

""all this is in a blink of an eye compared to the millions of years that many species have been living on the planet,"" lambertini added.

- 'staggering' fall -

the last half-decade has seen unprecedented economic growth underpinned by an explosion in global consumption of natural resources.

whereas until 1970, humanity's ecological footprint was smaller than the earth's capacity to regenerate resources, the wwf now calculates we are over using the planet's capacity by more than half.

while aided by factors such as invasive species and pollution, the biggest single driver of species lost is land-use changes: normally, industry converting forests or grasslands into farms.

this takes an immense toll on wild species, who lose their homes.

but it also requires unsustainable levels of resources to uphold: one third of all land mass and three quarters of all freshwater are now dedicated to producing food.

the picture is equally dire in the ocean, where 75 percent of fish stocks are over exploited.

and while wildlife is declining rapidly, species are disappearing faster in some places than others.

the index showed that the tropical regions of central and south america had seen a 94 percent fall in species since 1970.

""it is staggering. it is ultimately an indicator of our impact on the natural world,"" said lambertini.

- 'from sad to worried' -

the living planet update comes alongside a study co-authored by more than 40 ngos and academic institutions, which lays out ways of arresting and reversing the losses human consumption has inflicted.

the research, published in the journal nature, suggests that reducing food waste and favouring healthier and more environmentally friendly diets could help to ""bend the curve"" of degradation.

coupled with radical conservation efforts, these measures could avert more than two-thirds of future biodiversity loss, the authors suggested.

""we need to act now. rates of biodiversity recovery are typically much slower than those of recent biodiversity loss,"" said lead study author david leclere, research scholar at the international institute of applied system analysis.

""this implies that any delay in action will allow further biodiversity losses that might take decades to restore.""

leclere also warned of ""irreversible"" losses to biodiversity, such as when a species goes extinct.

lambertini said that, like public discourse on climate change, societies are increasingly concerned about the links between the health of the planet and human well-being.

""from being sad about losing nature, people are beginning to actually get worried,"" he said.

""we still have a moral duty to co-exist with life on the planet, but there's now this new element of impact on our society, our economy and, of course, our health.

"'I saved his a--': Trump boasted that he protected Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder, Woodward's new book says",336,iqbfy1,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-woodward-i-saved-his-ass-mbs-khashoggi-rage-2020-9,82,1599798073.0,,"president donald trump bragged that he protected saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman after the assassination and dismembering of the washington post columnist jamal khashoggi in october 2018.

""i saved his ass,"" trump had said amid the us outcry over khashoggi's killing, according to bob woodward's new book. ""i was able to get congress to leave him alone. i was able to get them to stop.""

the president told woodward he didn't believe that mbs ordered khashoggi's murder, though the us and other foreign intelligence services concluded that he did order the attack.

after khashoggi's murder, trump bypassed congress to sell roughly $8 billion in arms to the saudis and the united arab emirates. he vetoed a trio of resolutions blocking the sale, as well as a resolution to end us support for the saudi-led coalition in yemen.

president donald trump bragged that he protected saudi arabia's crown prince mohammed bin salman from congressional scrutiny after the brutal assassination of the american journalist jamal khashoggi.

that's according to the veteran reporter bob woodward's upcoming book, ""rage,"" set to be released next tuesday. insider obtained a copy of the book.

woodward conducted 17 wide-ranging interviews with the president for the book, as well as interviews with multiple senior white house officials and former administration officials. still, trump last month slammed the book as ""a fake, as always, just as many of the others have been.""

woodward wrote that trump called him on january 22 shortly after attending the world economic forum in davos, switzerland. during the conversation, woodward pressed the president about khashoggi's gruesome murder.

khashoggi, 59, a longtime washington post columnist known for his criticism of the saudi kingdom, was assassinated and dismembered at the saudi consulate in istanbul on october 2, 2018, after going there to get paperwork for his upcoming marriage.

the cia concluded a little over a month later that prince mohammed, also known as mbs, had personally ordered khashoggi's murder.

""the people at the post are upset about the khashoggi killing,"" woodward told trump on january 22, his book says. ""that is one of the most gruesome things. you yourself have said.""

""yeah, but iran is killing 36 people a day, so —"" trump began, before woodward redirected the conversation and continued to press trump about mbs's role in ordering khashoggi's killing.

""i saved his ass,"" trump had said amid the us outcry following khashoggi's murder, the book says. ""i was able to get congress to leave him alone. i was able to get them to stop.""

the white house did not offer a comment when contacted by insider.

when a reporter pressed trump on thursday about what the president meant when he said he'd ""saved"" the saudi leader's ""ass,"" trump replied: ""you'll have to figure that out yourself.""

during his january 22 conversation with woodward, the president said: ""well, i understand what you're saying, and i've gotten involved very much. i know everything about the whole situation.""

trump added that saudi arabia spent billions of dollars on us products. he also stressed mbs's claim that he's innocent, though us intelligence and other foreign intelligence agencies have concluded otherwise.

""he will always say that he didn't do it,"" trump said of mbs. ""he says that to everybody, and frankly i'm happy that he says that. but he will say that to you, he will say that to congress, and he will say that to everybody. he's never said he did it.""

""do you believe that he did it?"" woodward asked.

""no, he says that he didn't do it,"" trump replied.

""i know, but do you really believe —"" woodward said before trump cut him off.

""he says very strongly that he didn't do it,"" trump said. ""bob, they spent $400 billion over a fairly short period of time.""

he added: ""and you know, they're in the middle east. you know, they're big. because of their religious monuments, you know, they have the real power. they have the oil, but they also have the great monuments for religion. you know that, right? for that religion.

""they wouldn't last a week if we're not there, and they know it,"" he said.

trump repeatedly used executive power to block or bypass congressional efforts to cut ties with riyadh after khashoggi's murder.

last year, he vetoed a bipartisan bill to end us support for the saudis in yemen. the war in yemen has led to a devastating humanitarian crisis, and the saudi-led coalition has killed civilians using us-made bombs.

the president also bypassed congress to push through an arms sale worth roughly $8 billion to the saudis and the united arab emirates, and he later vetoed several resolutions blocking the sale.

more recently, trump has moved to circumvent a decades-old arms-control pact in order to sell weaponized drones to the saudis and to other countries in the region, sparking backlash from democrats and republicans in congress."

in an interview with woodward on february 7, mr. trump said the coronavirus was ""more deadly"" than ""even your strenuous flus,"" and difficult to address because ""it goes through air.""

""it goes through air, bob. that's always tougher than the touch. you know, the touch, you don't have to touch things. right? but the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed,"" mr. trump told woodward. ""and so, that's a very tricky one. that's a very delicate one.""

woodward interviewed the president for a total of nine hours for his new book, ""rage,"" and audio clips of the recorded interviews were published by cnn and the washington post on wednesday.

despite raising these concerns with woodward, mr. trump held six rallies indoors between february 7 and march 2. public health experts have raised concerns about holding large events in indoor venues, given the risk of spreading the virus. mr. trump participated in rallies in new hampshire on february 10; arizona on february 19; colorado on february 20; february 21 in nevada; south carolina on february 28; and in north carolina on march 2. no social distancing measures were put in place for these rallies.

the president's campaign rallies in new hampshire, nevada, south carolina and north carolina occurred in the days before the democratic primaries in those respective states. the trump campaign canceled its planned march 19 rally in wisconsin due to the coronavirus.

in an interview with woodward on march 19, the president conceded that he was downplaying the threat of the virus in public.

""i wanted to always play it down. i still like playing it down, because i don't want to create a panic,"" mr. trump told woodward.

in a tweet on thursday morning, mr. trump defended his comments to woodward, saying that woodward would have revealed them earlier if they were ""bad or dangerous.""

""bob woodward had my quotes for many months. if he thought they were so bad or dangerous, why didn't he immediately report them in an effort to save lives? didn't he have an obligation to do so? no, because he knew they were good and proper answers. calm, no panic!"" mr. trump wrote."
Trump officials interfered with CDC reports on Covid-19,312,ir69ug,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/11/exclusive-trump-officials-interfered-with-cdc-reports-on-covid-19-412809,41,1599914469.0,,"the cdc's morbidity and mortality weekly reports are authored by career scientists and serve as the main vehicle for the agency to inform doctors, researchers and the general public about how covid-19 is spreading and who is at risk. such reports have historically been published with little fanfare and no political interference, said several longtime health department officials, and have been viewed as a cornerstone of the nation's public health work for decades.

but since michael caputo, a former trump campaign official with no medical or scientific background, was installed in april as the health and human services department's new spokesperson, there have been substantial efforts to align the reports with trump's statements, including the president's claims that fears about the outbreak are overstated, or stop the reports altogether.

caputo and his team have attempted to add caveats to the cdc's findings, including an effort to retroactively change agency reports that they said wrongly inflated the risks of covid-19 and should have made clear that americans sickened by the virus may have been infected because of their own behavior, according to the individuals familiar with the situation and emails reviewed by politico.

caputo's team also has tried to halt the release of some cdc reports, including delaying a report that addressed how doctors were prescribing hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug favored by trump as a coronavirus treatment despite scant evidence. the report, which was held for about a month after caputo’s team raised questions about its authors’ political leanings, was finally published last week. it said that ""the potential benefits of these drugs do not outweigh their risks.""

in one clash, an aide to caputo berated cdc scientists for attempting to use the reports to ""hurt the president"" in an aug. 8 email sent to cdc director robert redfield and other officials that was widely circulated inside the department and obtained by politico.

""cdc to me appears to be writing hit pieces on the administration,"" appointee paul alexander wrote, calling on redfield to modify two already published reports that alexander claimed wrongly inflated the risks of coronavirus to children and undermined trump's push to reopen schools. ""cdc tried to report as if once kids get together, there will be spread and this will impact school re-opening . . . very misleading by cdc and shame on them. their aim is clear.""

alexander also called on redfield to halt all future mmwr reports until the agency modified its years-old publication process so he could personally review the entire report prior to publication, rather than a brief synopsis. alexander, an assistant professor of health research at mcmaster university near toronto whom caputo recruited this spring to be his scientific adviser, added that cdc needed to allow him to make line edits — and demanded an "" immediate stop "" to the reports in the meantime.

""the reports must be read by someone outside of cdc like myself, and we cannot allow the reporting to go on as it has been, for it is outrageous. its lunacy,"" alexander told redfield and other officials. ""nothing to go out unless i read and agree with the findings how they cdc, wrote it and i tweak it to ensure it is fair and balanced and 'complete.'""

cdc officials have fought the efforts to retroactively change reports but have increasingly allowed caputo and his team to review them before publication, according to the three individuals with knowledge of the situation. caputo also helped install cdc’s interim chief of staff last month, two individuals added, ensuring that caputo himself would have more visibility into an agency that has often been at odds with hhs political officials during the pandemic.

asked by politico about why he and his team were demanding changes to cdc reports, caputo praised alexander as ""an oxford-educated epidemiologist"" who specializes ""in analyzing the work of other scientists,"" although he did not make him available for an interview.

""dr. alexander advises me on pandemic policy and he has been encouraged to share his opinions with other scientists. like all scientists, his advice is heard and taken or rejected by his peers,"" caputo said in a statement.

caputo also said that hhs was appropriately reviewing the cdc's reports. “our intention is to make sure that evidence, science-based data drives policy through this pandemic—not ulterior deep state motives in the bowels of cdc,"" he said.

caputo's team has spent months clashing with scientific experts across the administration. alexander this week tried to muzzle infectious-disease expert anthony fauci from speaking about the risks of the coronavirus to children, and the washington post reported in july that alexander had criticized the cdc's methods and findings.

but public health experts told politico that they were particularly alarmed that the cdc's reports could face political interference, praising the mmwrs as essential to fighting the pandemic.

""it's the go-to place for the public health community to get information that's scientifically vetted,"" said jennifer kates, who leads the kaiser family foundation's global health work. in an interview with politico, kates rattled off nearly a dozen examples of mmwr reports that she and other researchers have relied on to determine how covid-19 has spread and who's at highest risk, including reports on how the virus has been transmitted in nursing homes, at churches and among children."

an officer with the oxford police department arrived to break up a house party over the weekend that violated capacity rules, which currently allow gatherings of no more than 10 people. when police arrived at the house, several students were sitting on the porch, unmasked, drinking and listening to music.

despite allowing 20 people inside the house, the hosts of the party maintained they were following guidelines. according to the officer's body-camera footage, he warned the students that they were violating safety guidelines before running one student's license.

but after scanning the id of one of the students who lives in the house, he saw a note on his computer that the student tested positive for covid-19 just one week prior.

""how many other people have covid?"" the officer asked.

""they all do,"" the student replied, gesturing toward his housemates. he added that some of the guests had also tested positive.

""that's what we're trying to prevent,"" the officer said. ""we want to keep this town open.""

police fined six men — five who live in the house and one visitor — $500 each.

""this particular case is egregious, but i think for the most part, by in large, the students have been very well behaved,"" lt. lara fening with the oxford police department told cbs news affiliate wkrc.

""some residents came over from across the street that were reportedly covid-positive as well,"" said fening. ""we do not know if anybody else at that party was aware of the covid-positive residents because some of them left while the officer was there.""

miami university said it receives student violations from the oxford pd. the school told cbs news that it could not comment on an individual case, but said that any student in violation of quarantine or isolation orders, including hosting a large gathering, will face disciplinary action under the code of student conduct.

""we take these matters most seriously, and students can face suspension or dismissal for these types of violations,"" a spokesperson for the university told cbs news on friday.

the school announced this week that it will resume in-person and hybrid classes on campus on september 21, following a month of entirely online classes. students living on-campus are continuing their phased move-in starting monday.

all students returning to campus must be tested for coronavirus before moving into dorms. additionally, face masks are required for all students and faculty and all activities outside of the classroom with more than 10 participants have been canceled or moved virtually."

"Why every year, but especially 2020, feels like the worst ever",4,irzhex,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/why-2020-feels-like-the-worst-year-ever/,6,1600037124.0,,"in the year 2020, jenny eastwood became addicted to bad news. the 26-year-old from auckland, new zealand, couldn’t stop checking the narratives of the deadly pandemic, police brutality, protests, conspiracy theories, and politics as each crisis unfolded, particularly half a world away in the united states. every 10 minutes yielded another dire post on reddit or instagram.

“by the middle of the pandemic, i was feeling really flat,” says eastwood, who works in marketing. “i felt like humanity sucked in general, but i wasn’t able to concentrate on anything, because i’d be constantly thinking about checking the latest updates.”

like many people, eastwood had become obsessed with our world’s seemingly increasing danger—a response that has roots in our evolutionary development. stories of fear and peril pique our anxiety. they put our brains on high alert, an advantage that once protected our early hominid ancestors from predators and natural disasters, but one that now leaves us “doomscrolling,” endlessly refreshing social media and online news to stay abreast of the latest threats. our hearts race, and our minds keep constant vigil for the next perceived catastrophe. we yearn to feel prepared, so we become addicted to the updates, coming back for more until the world seems far worse than it ever has before.

plenty of tragedies are happening to keep us glued to our screens. the pandemic has killed more than 860,000 people around the world as of early september—and that number continues to rise even as the crisis calls attention to rampant social and economic inequality. we’ve been battered by record-setting wildfires in california and australia, an intense atlantic hurricane season, crop-mangling locust swarms in east africa, and a massive chemical explosion that obliterated the port of beirut and killed at least 190 people and caused as much as $15 billion in damage. protests against police brutality and symbols of confederate- and colonial-era oppression have brought millions of people to the streets the world over. as if all of this wasn’t enough, it’s also a highly divisive election year in the united states.

to be sure, 2020 hasn’t been all bad. telemedicine is making healthcare more accessible than ever. anti-racist books are topping bestseller lists. way more people are washing their hands. americans have adopted hundreds of thousands of shelter pets, and now it seems as if everybody has a dog.

if any year ever feels like the worst, it’s mostly because our brains have a tendency to judge the present more harshly. unfettered media consumption skews our perception, and it becomes easy to slide into unhealthy patterns of belief.

you don’t have to pull the plug on your whole digital life to get a better outlook on the year. according to experts, learning to tame your persistent negative beliefs or your penchant for looking at the past through rose-colored glasses could act as a much-needed respite from this year’s stress.

it was the best of times, it was the worst of times

our ancestors might disagree that 2020 is the worst year on record. sure, frightening things are happening, but many of those things happened in the past, too, including the 1918 flu pandemic, during which 50 million people died. plus, the belief that civilization is on the decline is a tradition as old as civilization itself. even ancient athenians complained in the fifth century b.c. that their democracy wasn’t what it used to be. these days, we call that belief “declinism,” or “decline bias.”

before the pandemic, a majority of americans already believed the country was going downhill. about 60 percent of respondents thought that the nation’s influence on the world was decreasing, according to a 2019 survey by the pew research center. only 12 percent of the people who responded to the poll were “very optimistic” about the country’s future, while 31 percent were “somewhat pessimistic” and 13 percent were “very pessimistic” about america’s future.

now, americans might feel worse about the future than they did before, especially because stay-at-home orders and isolation have been affecting our mental health, which in turn increases the likelihood that we’ll see the world through the lens of negativity bias.

in western culture, people already have a propensity to interpret present events negatively and tend to prefer the past, according to the research of carey morewedge, a professor of marketing at boston university. that is because our autobiographical memories are biased toward positivity. when we think about the past, we tend to remember positive experiences. this is sometimes called “rosy retrospection,” or “nostalgia bias.”

“if i’m thinking, for example, about how much i love going to baseball games, i’m not going to recall the times when my team lost,” morewedge says. “we’re judging the past on its greatest hits, but we judge the present on everything we have available.”

even historians have often fallen into the trap of venerating unrealistically positive versions of the past. such veneration often pops up in glittering terms like the “gilded age,” says erika harlitz-kern, a historian at florida international university in miami. in american history, the gilded age refers to the period between 1870 and 1900, when the industrial revolution gave rise to great leaps in technology, culture, and the arts.

“but this time period was also a time of social inequality, great poverty, and the continued genocide and displacement of native americans,” harlitz-kern explains. nonetheless, the term gilded age paints the period in an undoubtedly positive light.

enter social media, which gives us never-ending dollops of our messy, nuanced, seemingly dire present. it’s no wonder that the past looks rosy when we have so much data on the current tribulations of the world right at our fingertips.

why doomscrolling and social media go hand in hand

shocking almost no one, excessive news consumption causes stress. according to a 2017 survey by the american psychological association, respondents who kept up with the news cycle reported lost sleep, stress, anxiety, fatigue, and other negative mental health symptoms. the same survey found as many as 20 percent of americans constantly monitor their social media feeds for updates, and one in 10 check the news every hour.

although it seems like the news today is more shocking than ever, the idea that media consumption negatively affects our perception of the world is nothing new. in 1968, an ambitious investigation kicked off at the annenberg school for communication at the university of pennsylvania. called the cultural indicators project, it became one of the first comprehensive studies of the influence of television on the attitudes and perceptions of american viewers. the study, led by the school’s dean, george gerbner, found a direct correlation between time spent watching television and the likelihood that the watcher will perceive the world as more frightening or dangerous, a phenomenon he called the “mean world syndrome.”

gerber found that viewers who watch violent television shows typically believe violence is common in reality. this fell in line with his “cultivation theory,” which hypothesized that the more television people watch, the more they begin to believe that television mirrors reality instead of being stylized for dramatic effect.

modern research has continued to reinforce these ideas, but the effects aren’t always negative. it all depends on the medium of consumption and how you use it, according to mesfin awoke bekalu, a research scientist who studies the relationship between social media and public health at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health.

bekalu warns us not to conflate the effects of social media with previous research on television consumption. unlike watching television, which is a passive activity, engaging on social media requires active participation, which means studying its effects is much more complicated. on the positive side, social media can offer its users emotional and social support, which some users have found indispensable during the pandemic. however, social media can also cause us to experience the “displacement effect,” a phenomenon in which mental activity takes the place of a physical human need.

“social media displaces social interactions in real life, such as in-person social interactions or family communication,” says bekalu. “it even displaces health-promoting activities, such as physical exercise and sleep.”

as eastwood found, social media consumption can become an addictive cycle. every time we return to social media, we have yet another slew of opportunities to fall into psychological traps. people who are afraid of missing out often spend more time on social media than others, which can lead to fatigue and ultimately to digital burnout. “for young people, upward social comparison can become a problem,” says bekalu. “youngsters often engage in comparing themselves with others, which very often leads to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.”

but time spent on social media isn’t as important as how users spend that time. actively engaging in positive conversations with friends and family members can improve someone’s overall psychological state. by contrast, “lurking,” or scrolling through updates posted by friends or strangers without engaging, tends to have negative psychological effects.

rosy introspection, or less antisocial networking

psychologists say we may never see the present as perfect, but we can learn to control our biases. the first step is to acknowledge how the media we consume shifts our perceptions. it gives our panic-prone primate brains more reasons to feel stressed and more examples of the present to compare with our highly edited version of the past. when we are mindful of our thought patterns, we can take control of them, and give ourselves a reality check, says morewedge.

“we need to be mindful of the kind of social network we are in, who we are engaging with, and what kinds of content we consume,” cautions bekalu. “social media can make us perceive the present as worse than the past, but that isn’t true for everyone.”

to get control of your nostalgia bias, take a more realistic view of history and really compare it with the present. the pandemic is scary, but at least you’re not a medieval peasant with the bubonic plague around every corner and with no understanding of how germs work.

put the present into perspective by taking stock in what we do have, too. we are making progress socially and scientifically, and research teams around the world are working on vaccines for the coronavirus, a feat that wouldn’t have been possible even a hundred years ago."
Trump Endorses Extrajudicial Executions: Killing of Antifa Suspect Was “Retribution”,23,is1rno,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/09/trump-endorses-extrajudicial-executions-retribution-reinoehl.html,8,1600044643.0,,"president donald trump appeared to give a nod to law enforcement officers killing suspected criminals, describing the death of an alleged shooting suspect by u.s. marshals as “retribution.” speaking in an interview with fox news host jeanine pirro, trump spoke of the incident in which a law enforcement officer killed a self-described anti-fascist activist earlier this month in washington state as they sought to arrest him on suspicion that he fatally shot a right-wing protester in portland, oregon. trump seemed to endorse the killing. “this guy was a violent criminal, and the u.s. marshals killed him,” trump told pirro. “and i will tell you something—that’s the way it has to be. there has to be retribution.”

trump was referring to the killing of michael forest reinoehl on sept. 3. reinoehl was a key suspect in the killing of a member of the far-right group patriot prayer during a protest in portland on aug. 29. in an interview published by vice news hours before he was killed, reinoehl said he acted in self-defense. “you know, lots of lawyers suggest that i shouldn’t even be saying anything, but i feel it’s important that the world at least gets a little bit of what’s really going on,” reinoehl said. “i had no choice. i mean, i, i had a choice. i could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. but i wasn’t going to do that.” reinoehl, an army veteran, said during the interview that he provided “security” at black lives matter protests.

shortly after that interview was published, law enforcement agents shot and killed reinoehl as they moved to arrest him. officers claimed reinoehl was brandishing a weapon, but it isn’t clear whether he fired at police. no law enforcement officers were injured. “initial reports indicate the suspect produced a firearm, threatening the lives of law enforcement officers,” the marshals service said in a statement. “task force members responded to the threat and struck the suspect who was pronounced dead at the scene.”

witnesses have differing accounts of what happened that day. one person who witnessed the killing said reinoehl was clutching his cellphone when two unmarked cars showed up and officers began firing. “officers shot multiple rapid-fire rounds at reinoehl before issuing a brief ‘stop’ command, quickly followed by more rapid-fire shooting by additional officers,” according to a statement provided by the witness. two other witnesses who were nearby, though, say they saw reinoehl open fire and the officers fired back. “it reminded me of a video game,” one of the witnesses said.

Exclusive: Data shows that half of 2019 donations to ActBlue came from untraceable 'unemployed' donors A Take Back Action Fund analysis of $400M in donations to liberal causes raises red flags of possible foreign involvement,0,is5xo0,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-data-shows-that-half-of-2019-donations-to-actblue-came-from-untraceable-unemployed-donors,5,1600057347.0,,"exclusive: less than two months ahead of the presidential election – with concerns of foreign interference again at the forefront – a conservative political group is raising ""serious concerns"" about millions of donations reported by a major democratic fundraising platform.

a preliminary computer analysis by the take back action fund, obtained exclusively by fox news, has found that nearly half of all 2019 donations to actblue were made by people claiming to be unemployed.

action fund president john pudner questioned the veracity of those donations and called it a loophole that must be closed for the sake of election integrity.

""after downloading hundreds of millions of [dollars in] donations to the take back action fund servers, we were shocked to see that almost half of the donations to actblue in 2019 claimed to be unemployed individuals,"" he said. ""the name of employers must be disclosed when making political donations, but more than 4.7 million donations came from people who claimed they did not have an employer. those 4.7 million donations totaled $346 million actblue raised and sent to liberal causes.""

the trend is continuing this year: an action fund examination of 2020 data from january through august showed an uptick in ""unemployed"" donations through actblue, to 50.1% this year.

actblue defends the integrity of its donations and said many come from retirees and people who aren't counted as employed, such as homemakers.

according to the findings of the action fund – a nonprofit that aims to ""educate the public on conservative solutions for political reform"" – 48.4% of actblue donations last year, prior to the massive loss of jobs that came with the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic, came from those who did not list an employer or who claimed to be unemployed.

pudner said the large number is a red flag that some donations may be illicit contributions from foreign interests attempting to impact u.s. elections.

""it is hard to believe that at a time when the u.s. unemployment rate was less than 4 percent, that unemployed people had $346 million dollars to send to actblue for liberal causes,"" pudner said, adding that ""4.7 million donations from people without a job ... raised serious concerns.""

republicans demand answers on mueller team wiping phones, suggest 'anticipatory obstruction of justice'

actblue, created in 2004, bills itself as a ""powerful online fundraising platform available to democratic candidates and committees, progressive organizations, and nonprofits that share our values for no cost besides a 3.95% processing fee on donations.""

""and we operate as a conduit, which means donations made through actblue to a campaign or organization are considered individual donations,"" its website explains.

but critics, including the action fund, contend that the website allows credit card donations that are not verified, so anyone from any country in the world can donate without a paper trail.

""actblue's insistence on refusing to allow banks to verify their donations is an invitation to foreign programmers or others to send money through them using fake american names, and we encourage them to start letting banks verify the identity of donors to stop the potential for millions of dollars to influence our election,"" pudner said.

last year, the republican party created a competing fundraising platform called winred to counter actblue's prowess in small-donor sourcing.

according to the action fund, an analysis of winred's 4.9 million donations totalling $302 million found that only 4% came from people who did not list an employer or were unemployed. this year, the rate is 5.6%, according to the data.

""we purposely wanted to examine 2019 first, because, before covid-19, the unemployment rate was at 4 percent or below. it's hard to believe that millions of americans who were out of work had $346 million to spare to give to actblue for liberal causes,"" pudner said.

precisely determining if the donations were authentic and genuinely from those who were unemployed requires further time and resources, he said.

""auditing these suspect donations to determine if millions lied by indicating they were unemployed when in fact they were not, or if their names were just being used by a foreign programmer or someone else to move money without their knowledge, will take time,"" pudner said. ""we've planned a series of forensic procedures to identify whether or not these donors of record exist or not, if they made the contributions themselves, and whether they were legally able, and whether or not they are potential 'straw' donors, making the contributions after being given the money and direction by someone else.""

in response to questions by fox news, a representative for actblue said ""it is best security practice to refrain from publicly sharing any detailed information about how we analyze contributions.""

""but we use an array of data sources, internal validation and third-party services to verify the validity of transactions. we take the security of our platform and integrity of donations very seriously,"" the spokesperson said. ""we report every contribution to federal candidates that comes through our platform, and you can look those up on the fec. we report the information donors enter about their occupation and employer, and we do see a significant portion of donors who report their status as not employed, such as retired donors or full-time parents.""

the issue of unauthenticated political donations was also brought to light by the washington post in 2008, which was at the time ""allowing donors to use largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor's identity.""

in 2015, the action fund said millions of dollars ""could be moved by allowing unverified credit card contributions,"" and pudner said that even today, actblue continues to use such an ""unverified system.""

""we found it took other vendors only a matter of hours to switch their system to allow verification of donations and thus prevent the possibility of illegal foreign money being moved into campaigns,"" pudner said. ""choosing to use an untraceable system has a higher cost in terms of the risk of credit card fraud and also tends to incur higher bank fees. and this untraceable system allows someone with a gift card to make donations in anyone's name, even if that person never actually made that donation, or even if that person doesn't exist at all.""

despite such claims, actblue currently holds the highest level of certification as a service provider.

both winred and actblue note on their donation pages that law requires donors to list their employer and occupation.

""the problem,"" pudner said, ""is on the back end where actblue does not allow banks to verify the identity of the cardholder, meaning someone could buy endless gift cards and list any name they wanted and leave the employer line blank or type in words like 'not employed,' 'unemployed.'""

""with half of actblue donors indicating they do not have an employer, we recommend they start letting their payment processors verify donations to stop any foreign or other illicit donations by simply listing themselves as an unemployed american,"" pudner added."

Nvidia Buys Arm From SoftBank for $40 Billion,150,isbhkv,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/technology/nvidia-arm-softbank.html,18,1600076706.0,,"san francisco — nvidia said on sunday that it would acquire the british chip designer arm from softbank in deal worth about $40 billion, a move that could reshape the battle over technology that powers smartphones and data centers.

nvidia, best known for supplying chips that render images in video games, said it would pay softbank a combination of cash and shares in the transaction. nvidia’s market capitalization has skyrocketed to over $300 billion lately, partly owing to recent success in artificial intelligence applications and pandemic-fueled growth in chips used for pc gaming.

if completed, the transaction would instantly transform nvidia into one of the most influential players in smartphone technology, a market that had previously eluded it. arm, which licenses designs that other companies turn into chips, has long defined the computing technology found in most mobile devices. and arm designs are starting to play a bigger role in cloud data centers.

miami (ap) — presidential politics move fast. what we’re watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign:

days to general election: 50

days to first debate: 15

___

the narrative

president donald trump is fighting to move past another bad week following revelations that he downplayed the threat of the coronavirus throughout the spring even though he knew better. democrat joe biden and his allies have seized on the issue, although there are new signs that would-be supporters, especially in the latino community, remain unenthusiastic about biden’s candidacy.

advertisement

meanwhile, as early voting in key states gets underway, trump is embarking on an aggressive travel schedule backed by an army of on-the-ground canvassers. democrats, by contrast, continue to do much of their voter outreach over the internet.

at the same time, another billionaire is stepping in to help biden.

___

the big questions

how much more damage can woodward do?

it may feel like old news by now, but bob woodward’s new book is scheduled for official release on tuesday. the formal release will include more rounds of publicity that will ensure damning revelations about trump’s leadership on the pandemic — among other issues — will continue to reach broad swaths of voters.

trump’s team was already worried about his standing with older voters in some states, largely because of his chaotic response to the devastating public health threat. the last thing the republican president needs seven weeks before election day is continued reminders that he intentionally downplayed the deadly nature of the coronavirus.

rep. frederica wilson, d-fla., last week called him “a murderer.” the death toll is approaching 200,000 americans, even though just five months ago trump predicted that between 50,000 and 60,000 would ultimately die.

will democrats start knocking doors?

a growing chorus of democrats in key states are worried that republicans have an advantage in the election’s closing days because of the gop’s willingness to show up on voters’ doorsteps. biden’s team continues to resist in-person canvassing in deference to the pandemic, preferring to rely on the internet to host most of the democrats’ voter engagement efforts.

we went door knocking in south florida late last week with volunteers from a conservative group, libre action, and we were surprised by how many voters were willing to have doorstep conversations about the election — from a safe distance with masked activists. there were certainly a few voters who waved off the canvassers, but based on our experience door knocking across several elections, the response rate seemed productive.

advertisement

javier fernandez, a state senate candidate in south florida, told us that he joined a group of several democratic candidates that began knocking doors in person over the weekend. despite the risks, he said, “there’s a lot of value with direct voter engagement.”

we’ll see if democrats in other states make similar moves, even if biden’s team does not.

how serious is biden’s latino problem?

just one poll last week suggested biden may be underperforming among florida’s latinos, but we spoke to several prominent latino leaders and rank-and-file voters who report that biden’s struggle to energize the diverse voting bloc is real.

full coverage: election 2020

biden’s team has strengths elsewhere that could make up for any potential shortfall — particularly among older voters, suburbanites and african americans — but any challenges with the nation’s fastest-growing demographic should be cause for alarm. biden’s problem may be most apparent in florida, but latinos represent a significant voting bloc in other swing states such as arizona, pennsylvania and even wisconsin.

many latinos are quick to say that trump’s rhetoric and actions are abhorrent, but they also say that biden hasn’t given them much to be excited about. on several issues like deportations, border security and health care, biden has been to the right of his more liberal former democratic presidential rivals. also, there are signs that latinos are particularly susceptible to trump’s focus on protest-related violence and false accusations that biden is a socialist.

biden will be in florida on tuesday. trump, meanwhile, spent part of his sunday courting latinos in nevada. he campaigns in arizona on monday.

will bloomberg’s millions make a difference?

in case you’re getting numb to big numbers in political advertising, we thought we’d provide some context for new york billionaire michael bloomberg’s weekend pledge to spend at least $100 million in florida to help biden.

should he follow through, and history suggests he will, bloomberg’s advertising investment will exceed the combined florida advertising reserves of both presidential campaigns and all their allied super pacs, who have committed a total of $82.4 million through the next seven weeks, according to the ad tracking firm kantar/cmag.

there is no more expensive swing state on the 2020 map and there is no state more important to trump’s reelection than florida. polls suggest that trump and biden are locked in a close race there.

How Big Oil Misled The Public Into Believing Plastic Would Be Recycled,100,ismoay,https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled,10,1600124927.0,,"how big oil misled the public into believing plastic would be recycled

enlarge this image toggle caption laura sullivan/npr laura sullivan/npr

note: an audio version of this story aired on npr's planet money. listen to the episode here.

laura leebrick, a manager at rogue disposal & recycling in southern oregon, is standing on the end of its landfill watching an avalanche of plastic trash pour out of a semitrailer: containers, bags, packaging, strawberry containers, yogurt cups.

none of this plastic will be turned into new plastic things. all of it is buried.

""to me that felt like it was a betrayal of the public trust,"" she said. ""i had been lying to people ... unwittingly.""

rogue, like most recycling companies, had been sending plastic trash to china, but when china shut its doors two years ago, leebrick scoured the u.s. for buyers. she could find only someone who wanted white milk jugs. she sends the soda bottles to the state.

but when leebrick tried to tell people the truth about burying all the other plastic, she says people didn't want to hear it.

""i remember the first meeting where i actually told a city council that it was costing more to recycle than it was to dispose of the same material as garbage,"" she says, ""and it was like heresy had been spoken in the room: you're lying. this is gold. we take the time to clean it, take the labels off, separate it and put it here. it's gold. this is valuable.""

but it's not valuable, and it never has been. and what's more, the makers of plastic — the nation's largest oil and gas companies — have known this all along, even as they spent millions of dollars telling the american public the opposite.

in partnership this story is part of a joint investigation with the pbs series frontline that includes the documentary plastic wars, which aired march 31 on pbs. watch it online now.

npr and pbs frontline spent months digging into internal industry documents and interviewing top former officials. we found that the industry sold the public on an idea it knew wouldn't work — that the majority of plastic could be, and would be, recycled — all while making billions of dollars selling the world new plastic.

the industry's awareness that recycling wouldn't keep plastic out of landfills and the environment dates to the program's earliest days, we found. ""there is serious doubt that [recycling plastic] can ever be made viable on an economic basis,"" one industry insider wrote in a 1974 speech.

yet the industry spent millions telling people to recycle, because, as one former top industry insider told npr, selling recycling sold plastic, even if it wasn't true.

""if the public thinks that recycling is working, then they are not going to be as concerned about the environment,"" larry thomas, former president of the society of the plastics industry, known today as the plastics industry association and one of the industry's most powerful trade groups in washington, d.c., told npr.

in response, industry representative steve russell, until recently the vice president of plastics for the trade group the american chemistry council, said the industry has never intentionally misled the public about recycling and is committed to ensuring all plastic is recycled.

""the proof is the dramatic amount of investment that is happening right now,"" russell said. ""i do understand the skepticism, because it hasn't happened in the past, but i think the pressure, the public commitments and, most important, the availability of technology is going to give us a different outcome.""

here's the basic problem: all used plastic can be turned into new things, but picking it up, sorting it out and melting it down is expensive. plastic also degrades each time it is reused, meaning it can't be reused more than once or twice.

on the other hand, new plastic is cheap. it's made from oil and gas, and it's almost always less expensive and of better quality to just start fresh.

all of these problems have existed for decades, no matter what new recycling technology or expensive machinery has been developed. in all that time, less than 10 percent of plastic has ever been recycled. but the public has known little about these difficulties.

it could be because that's not what they were told.

starting in the 1990s, the public saw an increasing number of commercials and messaging about recycling plastic.

""the bottle may look empty, yet it's anything but trash,"" says one ad from 1990 showing a plastic bottle bouncing out of a garbage truck. ""it's full of potential. ... we've pioneered the country's largest, most comprehensive plastic recycling program to help plastic fill valuable uses and roles.""

these commercials carried a distinct message: plastic is special, and the consumer should recycle it.

it may have sounded like an environmentalist's message, but the ads were paid for by the plastics industry, made up of companies like exxon, chevron, dow, dupont and their lobbying and trade organizations in washington.

industry companies spent tens of millions of dollars on these ads and ran them for years, promoting the benefits of a product that, for the most part, was buried, was burned or, in some cases, wound up in the ocean.

documents show industry officials knew this reality about recycling plastic as far back as the 1970s.

many of the industry's old documents are housed in libraries, such as the one on the grounds of the first dupont family home in delaware. others are with universities, where former industry leaders sent their records.

at syracuse university, there are boxes of files from a former industry consultant. and inside one of them is a report written in april 1973 by scientists tasked with forecasting possible issues for top industry executives.

recycling plastic, it told the executives, was unlikely to happen on a broad scale.

""there is no recovery from obsolete products,"" it says.

it says pointedly: plastic degrades with each turnover.

""a degradation of resin properties and performance occurs during the initial fabrication, through aging, and in any reclamation process,"" the report told executives.

recycling plastic is ""costly,"" it says, and sorting it, the report concludes, is ""infeasible.""

and there are more documents, echoing decades of this knowledge, including one analysis from a top official at the industry's most powerful trade group. ""the costs of separating plastics ... are high,"" he tells colleagues, before noting that the cost of using oil to make plastic is so low that recycling plastic waste ""can't yet be justified economically.""

larry thomas, the former president of the society of the plastics industry, worked side by side with top oil and plastics executives.

he's retired now, on the coast of florida where he likes to bike, and feels conflicted about the time he worked with the plastics industry.

""i did what the industry wanted me to do, that's for sure,"" he says. ""but my personal views didn't always jibe with the views i had to take as part of my job.""

thomas took over back in the late 1980s, and back then, plastic was in a crisis. there was too much plastic trash. the public was getting upset.

in one document from 1989, thomas calls executives at exxon, chevron, amoco, dow, dupont, procter & gamble and others to a private meeting at the ritz-carlton in washington.

""the image of plastics is deteriorating at an alarming rate,"" he wrote. ""we are approaching a point of no return.""

he told the executives they needed to act.

the ""viability of the industry and the profitability of your company"" are at stake.

thomas remembers now.

""the feeling was the plastics industry was under fire — we got to do what it takes to take the heat off, because we want to continue to make plastic products,"" he says.

at this time, thomas had a co-worker named lew freeman. he was a vice president of the lobbying group. he remembers many of the meetings like the one in washington.

""the basic question on the table was, you guys as our trade association in the plastics industry aren't doing enough — we need to do more,"" freeman says. ""i remember this is one of those exchanges that sticks with me 35 years later or however long it's been ... and it was what we need to do is ... advertise our way out of it. that was the idea thrown out.""

so began the plastics industry's $50 million-a-year ad campaign promoting the benefits of plastic.

""presenting the possibilities of plastic!"" one iconic ad blared, showing kids in bike helmets and plastic bags floating in the air.

""this advertising was motivated first and foremost by legislation and other initiatives that were being introduced in state legislatures and sometimes in congress,"" freeman says, ""to ban or curb the use of plastics because of its performance in the waste stream.""

at the same time, the industry launched a number of feel-good projects, telling the public to recycle plastic. it funded sorting machines, recycling centers, nonprofits, even expensive benches outside grocery stores made out of plastic bags.

few of these projects actually turned much plastic into new things.

npr tracked down almost a dozen projects the industry publicized starting in 1989. all of them shuttered or failed by the mid-1990s. mobil's massachusetts recycling facility lasted three years, for example. amoco's project to recycle plastic in new york schools lasted two. dow and huntsman's highly publicized plan to recycle plastic in national parks made it to seven out of 419 parks before the companies cut funding.

none of them was able to get past the economics: making new plastic out of oil is cheaper and easier than making it out of plastic trash.

both freeman and thomas, the head of the lobbying group, say the executives all knew that.

""there was a lot of discussion about how difficult it was to recycle,"" thomas remembers. ""they knew that the infrastructure wasn't there to really have recycling amount to a whole lot.""

even as the ads played and the projects got underway, thomas and freeman say industry officials wanted to get recycling plastic into people's homes and outside on their curbs with blue bins.

the industry created a special group called the council for solid waste solutions and brought a man from dupont, ron liesemer, over to run it.

liesemer's job was to at least try to make recycling work — because there was some hope, he said, however unlikely, that maybe if they could get recycling started, somehow the economics of it all would work itself out.

""i had no staff, but i had money,"" liesemer says. ""millions of dollars.""

liesemer took those millions out to minnesota and other places to start local plastic recycling programs.

but then he ran into the same problem all the industry documents found. recycling plastic wasn't making economic sense: there were too many different kinds of plastic, hundreds of them, and they can't be melted down together. they have to be sorted out.

""yes, it can be done,"" liesemer says, ""but who's going to pay for it? because it goes into too many applications, it goes into too many structures that just would not be practical to recycle.""

liesemer says he started as many programs as he could and hoped for the best.

""they were trying to keep their products on the shelves,"" liesemer says. ""that's what they were focused on. they weren't thinking what lesson should we learn for the next 20 years. no. solve today's problem.""

and thomas, who led the trade group, says all of these efforts started to have an effect: the message that plastic could be recycled was sinking in.

""i can only say that after a while, the atmosphere seemed to change,"" he says. ""i don't know whether it was because people thought recycling had solved the problem or whether they were so in love with plastic products that they were willing to overlook the environmental concerns that were mounting up.""

but as the industry pushed those public strategies to get past the crisis, officials were also quietly launching a broader plan.

in the early 1990s, at a small recycling facility near san diego, a man named coy smith was one of the first to see the industry's new initiative.

back then, smith ran a recycling business. his customers were watching the ads and wanted to recycle plastic. so smith allowed people to put two plastic items in their bins: soda bottles and milk jugs. he lost money on them, he says, but the aluminum, paper and steel from his regular business helped offset the costs.

but then, one day, almost overnight, his customers started putting all kinds of plastic in their bins.

""the symbols start showing up on the containers,"" he explains.

smith went out to the piles of plastic and started flipping over the containers. all of them were now stamped with the triangle of arrows — known as the international recycling symbol — with a number in the middle. he knew right away what was happening.

""all of a sudden, the consumer is looking at what's on their soda bottle and they're looking at what's on their yogurt tub, and they say, 'oh well, they both have a symbol. oh well, i guess they both go in,' "" he says.

enlarge this image toggle caption laura sullivan/npr laura sullivan/npr

the bins were now full of trash he couldn't sell. he called colleagues at recycling facilities all across the country. they reported having the same problem.

industry documents from this time show that just a couple of years earlier, starting in 1989, oil and plastics executives began a quiet campaign to lobby almost 40 states to mandate that the symbol appear on all plastic — even if there was no way to economically recycle it. some environmentalists also supported the symbol, thinking it would help separate plastic.

smith said what it did was make all plastic look recyclable.

""the consumers were confused,"" smith says. ""it totally undermined our credibility, undermined what we knew was the truth in our community, not the truth from a lobbying group out of d.c.""

but the lobbying group in d.c. knew the truth in smith's community too. a report given to top officials at the society of the plastics industry in 1993 told them about the problems.

""the code is being misused,"" it says bluntly. ""companies are using it as a 'green' marketing tool.""

the code is creating ""unrealistic expectations"" about how much plastic can actually be recycled, it told them.

smith and his colleagues launched a national protest, started a working group and fought the industry for years to get the symbol removed or changed. they lost.

""we don't have manpower to compete with this,"" smith says. ""we just don't. even though we were all dedicated, it still was like, can we keep fighting a battle like this on and on and on from this massive industry that clearly has no end in sight of what they're able to do and willing to do to keep their image the image they want.""

""it's pure manipulation of the consumer,"" he says.

in response, industry officials told npr that the code was only ever meant to help recycling facilities sort plastic and was not intended to create any confusion.

without question, plastic has been critical to the country's success. it's cheap and durable, and it's a chemical marvel.

it's also hugely profitable. the oil industry makes more than $400 billion a year making plastic, and as demand for oil for cars and trucks declines, the industry is telling shareholders that future profits will increasingly come from plastic.

and if there was a sign of this future, it's a brand-new chemical plant that rises from the flat skyline outside sweeny, texas. it's so new that it's still shiny, and inside the facility, the concrete is free from stains.

this plant is chevron phillips chemical's $6 billion investment in new plastic.

""we see a very bright future for our products,"" says jim becker, the vice president of sustainability for chevron phillips, inside a pristine new warehouse next to the plant.

""these are products the world needs and continues to need,"" he says. ""we're very optimistic about future growth.""

with that growth, though, comes ever more plastic trash. but becker says chevron phillips has a plan: it will recycle 100% of the plastic it makes by 2040.

becker seems earnest. he tells a story about vacationing with his wife and being devastated by the plastic trash they saw. when asked how chevron phillips will recycle 100% of the plastic it makes, he doesn't hesitate.

""recycling has to get more efficient, more economic,"" he says. ""we've got to do a better job, collecting the waste, sorting it. that's going to be a huge effort.""

fix recycling is the industry's message too, says steve russell, the industry's recent spokesman.

""fixing recycling is an imperative, and we've got to get it right,"" he says. ""i understand there is doubt and cynicism. that's going to exist. but check back in. we're there.""

larry thomas, lew freeman and ron liesemer, former industry executives, helped oil companies out of the first plastic crisis by getting people to believe something the industry knew then wasn't true: that most plastic could be and would be recycled.

russell says this time will be different.

""it didn't get recycled because the system wasn't up to par,"" he says. ""we hadn't invested in the ability to sort it and there hadn't been market signals that companies were willing to buy it, and both of those things exist today.""

but plastic today is harder to sort than ever: there are more kinds of plastic, it's cheaper to make plastic out of oil than plastic trash and there is exponentially more of it than 30 years ago.

and during those 30 years, oil and plastic companies made billions of dollars in profit as the public consumed ever more quantities of plastic.

russell doesn't dispute that.

""and during that time, our members have invested in developing the technologies that have brought us where we are today,"" he says. ""we are going to be able to make all of our new plastic out of existing municipal solid waste in plastic.""

recently, an industry advocacy group funded by the nation's largest oil and plastic companies launched its most expensive effort yet to promote recycling and cleanup of plastic waste. there's even a new ad.

enlarge this image toggle caption laura sullivan/npr laura sullivan/npr

""we have the people that can change the world,"" it says to soaring music as people pick up plastic trash and as bottles get sorted in a recycling center.

freeman, the former industry official, recently watched the ad.

""déjà vu all over again,"" he says as the ad finishes. ""this is the same kind of thinking that ran in the '90s. i don't think this kind of advertising is, is helpful at all.""

larry thomas said the same.

""i don't think anything has changed,"" thomas says. ""sounds exactly the same.""

these days as thomas bikes down by the beach, he says he spends a lot of time thinking about the oceans and what will happen to them in 20 or 50 years, long after he is gone.

and as he thinks back to those years he spent in conference rooms with top executives from oil and plastic companies, what occurs to him now is something he says maybe should have been obvious all along.

he says what he saw was an industry that didn't want recycling to work. because if the job is to sell as much oil as you possibly can, any amount of recycled plastic is competition.

""you know, they were not interested in putting any real money or effort into recycling because they wanted to sell virgin material,"" thomas says. ""nobody that is producing a virgin product wants something to come along that is going to replace it. produce more virgin material — that's their business.""

and they are. analysts now expect plastic production to triple by 2050.

(ap photo/chiang ying-ying, file)

taipei, taiwan (ap) — china warned the united states on monday of potential “serious damage” to their relations if it does not withdraw from an upcoming economic meeting with taiwan that is expected to be attended by a senior american official.

chinese foreign ministry spokesman wang wenbin urged the u.s. at a daily briefing to “stop all forms of official exchanges with taiwan, so as to avoid serious damage to china-u.s. relations and peace and stability across the taiwan strait.”

taiwanese media reported that u.s. under secretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment keith krach is planning to visit the island later this week for an economic and commercial dialogue with taiwan’s government.

the visit would follow one by u.s. health secretary alex azar last month. azar was the highest-level u.s. cabinet official to visit since a break in formal ties between the u.s. and taiwanese government in 1979, when the u.s. accepted a “one-china policy” with beijing as its government.

a visit by krach is likely to inspire further anger from china. china considers self-ruled taiwan part of its own territory, and strongly opposes any official contacts between other nations and the island.

taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed last week that it was in negotiations with the u.s. on such talks, but did not comment on a specific date or who might attend from washington.

tensions are high between the u.s. and china over issues including trade, cybersecurity, technology and hong kong’s new national security law. relations have deteriorated further since the coronavirus outbreak. trump blames china for the pandemic, and he and his administration have repeatedly accused the country of hiding crucial information about the virus from the global community."
"Top HHS official accuses scientists of plotting against Trump, tells supporters to buy ammunition",311,isqv6m,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/516319-top-hhs-official-accuses-scientists-of-plotting-against-trump-tells,52,1600137061.0,,"the top communications official at the department of health and human services (hhs) accused career government scientists of plotting against president trump donald john trump republican philadelphia official responsible for vote counting says office getting death threats biden will call governors, mayors about mask mandate trump campaign voter fraud hotline flooded with prank calls more and told trump supporters to arm themselves ahead of the november presidential election.

in a facebook live video on sunday, hhs assistant secretary for public affairs michael caputo said the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) was harboring a “resistance unit"" to trump, the new york times reported.

the career scientists ""haven’t gotten out of their sweatpants except for meetings at coffee shops” to plot “how they’re going to attack donald trump,” caputo said, according to the times. “there are scientists who work for this government who do not want america to get well, not until after joe biden joe biden republican philadelphia official responsible for vote counting says office getting death threats biden will call governors, mayors about mask mandate trump campaign voter fraud hotline flooded with prank calls more is president.”

caputo reportedly hosted the event for followers of his personal facebook page. his comments came after politico first reported on friday that top political hhs appointees have been interfering with the publication of cdc's reports on the coronavirus pandemic.

top house democrats have now launched an investigation into the matter.

according to the times, caputo also warned trump's followers to be prepared for an armed insurrection, predicting the president would win but that democratic presidential nominee joe biden would refuse to concede the election.

""when donald trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,” caputo said. “if you carry guns, buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get.”

in a statement, hhs said ""mr. caputo is a critical, integral part of the president’s coronavirus response, leading on public messaging as americans need public health information to defeat the covid-19 pandemic.""

caputo, a veteran of trump's 2016 campaign who was made top spokesman at hhs in april, gave no evidence for any of his claims. but the attacks follow a pattern of top administration officials, and even trump himself, blaming shadowy figures inside the government for the president's coronavirus response.

last month, trump without evidence accused the ""deep state"" at the food and drug administration (fda) for slowing covid vaccine trials.

""the deep state, or whoever, over at the fda is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics,"" trump tweeted.

the deep state, or whoever, over at the fda is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after november 3rd. must focus on speed, and saving lives! @stevefda — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) august 22, 2020

according to the times, caputo reiterated those claims to his facebook followers, saying scientists “deep in the bowels of the cdc have given up science and become political animals.”

the cdc is typically an apolitical institution staffed by career scientists. the agency's headquarters are in atlanta, not washington, in an effort to avoid the type of political pressure to which it is now being accused of succumbing.

in the remarks, caputo veered from attacking scientists to accusing the far-left ""antifa"" movement of plotting an attack on trump supporters.

""remember the trump supporter who was shot and killed?” he said. “that was a drill.”

one person was singled out for praise amidst the attacks, the times said: cdc director robert redfield.

redfield “is one of my closest friends in washington,” caputo said. “he’s such a good man.”

after this story was published, the creator of the image, arthur zakirov, confirmed in a facebook message that it shows a 3d model of a mig-29, and that the soldiers were russian models. he said it was a composite photo created five years ago and taken in three different countries showing russian sky, greek mountains and french ground.

“this is a completely recreated scene from various photographs of mine,” said zakirov, a 34-year-old oil company analyst and hobbyist photographer based in the russian city of perm, about 700 miles east of moscow.

“today you hear about the kremlin’s hand in u.s. politics. tomorrow you are this hand,” he joked, saying he found the fact that his photo ended up in a trump fundraising ad “pretty funny.”

“everything happened through inattention,” he said, adding that the campaign had “bad fact-checking.”

the mig-29, a twin-engine fighter jet designed in the soviet union that first flew in 1977, is the russians’ mainstay fighter jet and has been sold all over the world. it was developed during the cold war specifically to counter american f-15 and f-16s, and the u.s. even obtained a few to play the adversary in war games. the planes have recently been spotted at a russian air base in syria and also libya.

russia has also exported them to a number of countries, including north korea, syria, india and uzbekistan. iran also acquired 68 of the mig-29s at the end of the soviet union. in 1997, the u.s. even bought 21 “nuclear-capable” mig-29 planes from moldova to keep them from getting in the hands of adversaries such as iran.

the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. the rnc declined to comment.

politicians have gotten in trouble in the past for running ads or creating content that featured russian or other countries’ military equipment. last october, rep. brian mast (r-fla.) tweeted a picture of the russian battlecruiser pyotr velikiy with the comment: “happy birthday to the us navy. to the men and women who serve to keep our waters safe, we thank you.” his office later took the tweet down.

Trump Administration Shocks Oil Industry With Biofuel Waiver Decision,49,it8wz9,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Trump-Administration-Shocks-Oil-Industry-With-Biofuel-Waiver-Decision.amp.html,5,1600205853.0,,"after shocking the oil industry with last week’s extension to a coastal drilling ban offshore florida, georgia, and a handful of other states, the trump administration said on monday that is has rejected nearly the vast majority of retroactive biofuel waiver petitions that were pending review, according to a reuters report.

biofuel waivers are often given to oil refiners who are otherwise tasked with blending ethanol into their gasoline every year—or purchase tradable credits from refiners that blend with ethanol.

refiners—especially small ones—have long argued that the requirements are cost-prohibitive. if they can prove economic hardship, they can be given a waiver.

the corn industry, on the other hand, argues that the federal government is in big oil’s pocket, and that it doesn’t take seriously enough the biofuel industry. the push-pull between the oil lobby and the corn lobby has created a massive political divide that is evident election after election.

in this election cycle, the blending waivers and blending credits have plagued president donald trump, who, like others before him, have been caught between angering the oil lobby or angering the corn lobby—with neither serving as an attractive option.

the disgruntled corn lobby, or biofuel industry, filed suit against the epa this last january, challenging exemptions that were granted to specific refineries. the court ruled that the three waivers in question were granted unjustly. the problem, according to the court, was that those refineries were not granted waivers in the year prior, and that waiver requests could only be handed down as extensions of prior years. related: tropical storm sally forces drillers to evacuate gulf of mexico oil platforms

the floodgates opened with that ruling, and any refiner that thought they needed a waiver rushed to submit petitions retroactively for years as far back as 2011 to plug the gap, so to speak.

the epa has finally decided on many of those retroactive petitions, and for refineries, it’s not good news.

between march and now, 68 petitions from 17 small refineries were submitted for prior years. of those, 54 have been squarely rejected, in a sign that president donald trump is once again assuming the oil industry vote is his no matter what.

Nurse questions medical care at immigration jail in Georgia,113,it9q8d,https://apnews.com/30d71f010ec2696c5ca8b69e62b97c09,12,1600208506.0,,"ocilla, ga. (ap) — an immigration detention center in georgia performed questionable hysterectomies, refused to test detainees for covid-19 and shredded medical records, according to a nurse quoted in a complaint filed monday.

the complaint to the homeland security department’s internal watchdog relies on accounts of dawn wooten, who worked full-time as a licensed practical nurse at the irwin county detention center until july, when she was demoted to work as needed.

wooten calls a gynecologist who works outside the facility “the uterus collector.”

“everybody he sees has a hysterectomy — just about everybody,” wooten said. “he’s even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady.”

it was unclear to wooten if women knowingly consented to the operations. nurses raised concerns about the doctor, who is unnamed.

“these immigrant women, i don’t think they really, totally, all the way understand this is what’s going to happen depending on who explains it to them,” she is quoted saying.

the facility in ocilla, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of atlanta, houses men and women detainees for u.s. immigration and customs enforcement, as well as inmates for the u.s. marshals service and irwin county.

ice said it does not comment on matters before the inspector general but that it takes all allegations seriously.

“that said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve,” the agency said in a statement.

while the 27-page complaint filed by advocacy group project south quotes unidentified detainees extensively, it also includes detailed comments from wooten. the complaint says wooten was demoted after missing work with coronavirus symptoms, which she believes was retaliation for raising questions about addressing covid-19.

wooten said the number of detainees infected was much higher than reported because there was no active testing and not all cases were reported, according to the complaint.

wooten is quoted as saying the sick call nurse sometimes fabricated seeing detainees in person when they hadn’t and that she saw the nurse shred a box of detainee complaints without looking at them. she said nurses ignored detainees reporting covid-19 symptoms.

if detainees reported a fever, nurses would put them on an over-the-counter cold medication for seven days without testing them for covid-19, she said.

full coverage: immigration

wooten said the facility declined to use two rapid-testing covid-19 machines that ice purchased for $14,000 each. no medical staff had been trained on them and she saw the machines used only once.

lasalle corrections, which owns and operates irwin county detention center under contract, did not immediately respond to a request for comment late monday.

as of sunday, 42 detainees at the facility had tested positive for the virus, according to ice. nationwide, 5,772 detainees were positive."
"Staggering Number of Hysterectomies Happening at ICE Facility, Whistleblower Says",48,itdjjf,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/93578d/staggering-number-of-hysterectomies-happening-at-ice-facility-whistleblower-say,4,1600220173.0,[deleted],"updated sept. 15, 10:05 a.m.: this story was updated with a statement from ice and a link to the whistleblower complaint.

a whistleblower complaint filed monday by several legal advocacy groups accuses a detention center of performing a staggering number of hysterectomies on immigrant women, as well as failing to follow procedures meant to keep both detainees and employees safe from the coronavirus.

the complaint, filed on behalf of several detained immigrants and a nurse named dawn wooten, details several accounts of recent “jarring medical neglect” at the irwin county detention center in ocilla, georgia, which is run by the private prison company lasalle south corrections and houses people incarcerated by immigration and customs enforcement (ice). in interviews with project south, a georgia nonprofit, multiple women said that hysterectomies were stunningly frequent among immigrants detained at the facility.

“when i met all these women who had had surgeries, i thought this was like an experimental concentration camp,” said one woman, who said she’d met five women who’d had hysterectomies after being detained between october and december 2019. the woman said that immigrants at irwin are often sent to see one particular gynecologist outside of the facility. “it was like they’re experimenting with their bodies.”

in one case, wooten said, a woman who ended up with a hysterectomy was not properly anesthetized and overhead the doctor say that he’d taken out the wrong ovary. that woman had to go back and get her other ovary removed as well, wooten said.

“we’ve questioned among ourselves, like, goodness, he’s taking everybody’s stuff out,” said wooten, who was a full-time employee at irwin until july. “that’s his specialty, he’s the uterus collector. i know that’s ugly.”

“is he collecting these things or something,” she continued. “everybody he sees, he’s taking all their uteruses out or he’s taken their tubes out. what in the world.”

wooten also said she’d talked to several detained immigrants who’d had hysterectomies but didn’t know why. one detained immigrant told project south that, ahead of the scheduled procedure, she was given multiple different explanations about what would happen and why it was necessary.

while ice reported in august that 41 immigrants at irwin have tested positive for covid-19, wooten believes that the true number may be much higher, according to the complaint. women housed in multiple units in the facility allegedly exhibited covid-19 symptoms, but were not tested for the virus for weeks. immigrants have also allegedly continued to be transferred in and out of the facility, against guidelines by the centers for disease control and the advice of irwin’s own medical director.

the complaint also alleges that both the detained immigrants and staffers at irwin lacked the personal protective equipment they need to stay safe during the coronavirus pandemic: people in both groups have only received one mask each since the pandemic broke out. it is also impossible to socially distance within the facility, according to the complaint.

“there is no way to protect [against covid-19] at all here in the facility,” one immigrant said. “we share everything together. there is no way at all we can feel protected here in the facility.

detained immigrants also said that the medical and quarantine unit in one part of the irwin facility were filthy. one woman said she had to clean her cell using shampoo because staffers wouldn’t give her any cleaning chemicals; she recalled seeing another woman use her socks to do the same.

“if it wasn’t for my faith in god, i think i would have gone insane and just break down and probably gone as far as hurting myself,” the woman said. “there are a lot of people here who end up in medical trying to kill themselves because of how crazy it is.”

some men at the facility even went on hunger strike, demanding to be released or to have better protections against the coronavirus, according to the complaint. but nothing changed.

meanwhile, employees are also expected to work even if they have covid-19 symptoms and are awaiting their test results, wooten said. and management at the facility also allegedly refuses to tell officers if any detained immigrants have tested positive for covid-19, which could heighten their risk of contracting the virus.

“ms. wooten explained that she believes icdc is hiding information about covid-19 in order to keep things quiet,” the complaint alleged. “she stated that everyone in the facility is scared at this point, so management does not want to tell officers and detained immigrants the truth because they are afraid of an uproar. instead, the secrecy has created a ‘silent pandemic’ where even if officers get covid-19 from the facility, the officers won’t be able to blame icdc because no one knows how prevalent covid-19 is inside icdc due to not testing detained immigrants and not sharing who has the virus.”

besides project south, the advocacy groups georgia detention watch, georgia latino alliance for human rights, and south georgia immigrant support network helped file the complaint with the department of homeland security’s office of the inspector general. law and crime published the complaint after the intercept covered some of the allegations inside it.

lasalle corrections didn’t immediately respond to a vice news request for comment. in the past, the irwin county detention center has repeatedly been found to be in compliance with ice’s detention standards.

in a statement, ice said it does not comment on matters handled by the office of the inspector general.

“ice takes all allegations seriously and defers to the oig regarding any potential investigation and/or results,” the agency said. “that said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve.”"
Scientific American Endorses Joe Biden: We’ve never backed a presidential candidate in our 175-year history—until now,400,itgby4,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientific-american-endorses-joe-biden/,172,1600228582.0,,"scientific american has never endorsed a presidential candidate in its 175-year history. this year we are compelled to do so. we do not do this lightly.

the evidence and the science show that donald trump has badly damaged the u.s. and its people—because he rejects evidence and science. the most devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the covid-19 pandemic, which cost more than 190,000 americans their lives by the middle of september. he has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country prepare for its greatest challenges. that is why we urge you to vote for joe biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy and the environment. these and other proposals he has put forth can set the country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable future.

the pandemic would strain any nation and system, but trump's rejection of evidence and public health measures have been catastrophic in the u.s. he was warned many times in january and february about the onrushing disease, yet he did not develop a national strategy to provide protective equipment, coronavirus testing or clear health guidelines. testing people for the virus, and tracing those they may have infected, is how countries in europe and asia have gained control over their outbreaks, saved lives, and successfully reopened businesses and schools. but in the u.s., trump claimed, falsely, that “anybody that wants a test can get a test.” that was untrue in march and remained untrue through the summer. trump opposed $25 billion for increased testing and tracing that was in a pandemic relief bill as late as july. these lapses accelerated the spread of disease through the country—particularly in highly vulnerable communities that include people of color, where deaths climbed disproportionately to those in the rest of the population.

it wasn't just a testing problem: if almost everyone in the u.s. wore masks in public, it could save about 66,000 lives by the beginning of december, according to projections from the university of washington school of medicine. such a strategy would hurt no one. it would close no business. it would cost next to nothing. but trump and his vice president flouted local mask rules, making it a point not to wear masks themselves in public appearances. trump has openly supported people who ignored governors in michigan and california and elsewhere as they tried to impose social distancing and restrict public activities to control the virus. he encouraged governors in florida, arizona and texas who resisted these public health measures, saying in april—again, falsely—that “the worst days of the pandemic are behind us” and ignoring infectious disease experts who warned at the time of a dangerous rebound if safety measures were loosened.

and of course, the rebound came, with cases across the nation rising by 46 percent and deaths increasing by 21 percent in june. the states that followed trump's misguidance posted new daily highs and higher percentages of positive tests than those that did not. by early july several hospitals in texas were full of covid-19 patients. states had to close up again, at tremendous economic cost. about 31 percent of workers were laid off a second time, following the giant wave of unemployment—more than 30 million people and countless shuttered businesses—that had already decimated the country. at every stage, trump has rejected the unmistakable lesson that controlling the disease, not downplaying it, is the path to economic reopening and recovery.

trump repeatedly lied to the public about the deadly threat of the disease, saying it was not a serious concern and “this is like a flu​” when he knew it was more lethal and highly transmissible, according to his taped statements to journalist bob woodward. his lies encouraged people to engage in risky behavior, spreading the virus further, and have driven wedges between americans who take the threat seriously and those who believe trump's falsehoods. the white house even produced a memo attacking the expertise of the nation's leading infectious disease physician, anthony fauci, in a despicable attempt to sow further distrust.

trump's reaction to america's worst public health crisis in a century has been to say “i don't take responsibility at all.” instead he blamed other countries and his white house predecessor, who left office three years before the pandemic began.

but trump's refusal to look at the evidence and act accordingly extends beyond the virus. he has repeatedly tried to get rid of the affordable care act while offering no alternative; comprehensive medical insurance is essential to reduce illness. trump has proposed billion-dollar cuts to the national institutes of health, the national science foundation, and the centers for disease control and prevention, agencies that increase our scientific knowledge and strengthen us for future challenges. congress has countermanded his reductions. yet he keeps trying, slashing programs that would ready us for future pandemics and withdrawing from the world health organization. these and other actions increase the risk that new diseases will surprise and devastate us again.

trump also keeps pushing to eliminate health rules from the environmental protection agency, putting people at more risk for heart and lung disease caused by pollution. he has replaced scientists on agency advisory boards with industry representatives. in his ongoing denial of reality, trump has hobbled u.s. preparations for climate change, falsely claiming that it does not exist and pulling out of international agreements to mitigate it. the changing climate is already causing a rise in heat-related deaths and an increase in severe storms, wildfires and extreme flooding.

joe biden, in contrast, comes prepared with plans to control covid-19, improve health care, reduce carbon emissions and restore the role of legitimate science in policy making. he solicits expertise and has turned that knowledge into solid policy proposals.

on covid-19, he states correctly that “it is wrong to talk about ‘choosing' between our public health and our economy.... if we don't beat the virus, we will never get back to full economic strength.” biden plans to ramp up a national testing board, a body that would have the authority to command both public and private resources to supply more tests and get them to all communities. he also wants to establish a public health job corps of 100,000 people, many of whom have been laid off during the pandemic crisis, to serve as contact tracers and in other health jobs. he will direct the occupational health and safety administration to enforce workplace safety standards to avoid the kind of deadly outbreaks that have occurred at meat-processing plants and nursing homes. while trump threatened to withhold money from school districts that did not reopen, regardless of the danger from the virus, biden wants to spend $34 billion to help schools conduct safe in-person instruction as well as remote learning.

biden is getting advice on these public health issues from a group that includes david kessler, epidemiologist, pediatrician and former u.s. food and drug administration chief; rebecca katz, immunologist and global health security specialist at georgetown university; and ezekiel emanuel, bioethicist at the university of pennsylvania. it does not include physicians who believe in aliens and debunked virus therapies, one of whom trump has called “very respected” and “spectacular.”

biden has a family and caregiving initiative, recognizing this as key to a sustained public health and economic recovery. his plans include increased salaries for child care workers and construction of new facilities for children because the inability to afford quality care keeps workers out of the economy and places enormous strains on families.

on the environment and climate change, biden wants to spend $2 trillion on an emissions-free power sector by 2035, build energy-efficient structures and vehicles, push solar and wind power, establish research agencies to develop safe nuclear power and carbon capture technologies, and more. the investment will produce two million jobs for u.s. workers, his campaign claims, and the climate plan will be partly paid by eliminating trump's corporate tax cuts. historically disadvantaged communities in the u.s. will receive 40 percent of these energy and infrastructure benefits.

it is not certain how many of these and his other ambitions biden will be able to accomplish; much depends on laws to be written and passed by congress. but he is acutely aware that we must heed the abundant research showing ways to recover from our present crises and successfully cope with future challenges.

although trump and his allies have tried to create obstacles that prevent people from casting ballots safely in november, either by mail or in person, it is crucial that we surmount them and vote. it's time to move trump out and elect biden, who has a record of following the data and being guided by science.

Trump criticizes Biden at town hall for not issuing a national mask mandate — but Biden as a candidate has no authority to do so,606,ituljf,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-criticizes-biden-on-national-mask-mandate-biden-not-president-2020-9,110,1600288604.0,,"president donald trump called out his democratic presidential rival, joe biden, for not implementing a national mask mandate, though biden has no authority to do so as a candidate.

""they said, 'we're going to do a national mandate on masks,'"" trump said tuesday evening at an abc news town hall. ""but he didn't do it, i mean, he never did it.""

president donald trump criticized his democratic presidential rival, joe biden, on tuesday evening for failing to enforce a national mask mandate — but biden, as a candidate, has no authority to do so.

trump leveled the attack after being asked by a voter during an abc news town hall why he had not supported universal mask-wearing.

""a good question is, you ask, like joe biden. they said, 'we're going to do a national mandate on masks,'"" trump said tuesday evening. ""but he didn't do it, i mean, he never did it.""

trump was referring to a policy promise that biden stressed last month as part of his plan to fight the pandemic if elected. biden has since walked back on the idea from a federal level, citing potential constitutionality issues, and instead said he would encourage governors to do so and lead by example by wearing face coverings publicly.

biden quickly reacted to trump's statements on tuesday evening: ""to be clear: i am not currently president.""

the centers for disease control and prevention has heavily recommended mask use when in public and around people who don't live in your household to help prevent coronavirus transmission. the nation's top infectious-disease expert, dr. anthony fauci, has also pushed for universal mask-wearing.

trump's messaging on masks has largely focused on allowing people to choose whether to wear them. during an indoor rally in nevada on sunday, his campaign required only attendees standing behind him — in view of tv cameras — to wear face coverings.

trump reiterated his standpoint tuesday evening, arguing that ""a lot of people don't want to wear masks.""

""who are those people?"" the abc news anchor george stephanopoulos asked.

""i'll tell you who those people are — waiters,"" trump responded. ""they come over and they serve you and they have a mask. and i saw it the other day where they were serving me, and they're playing with the mask — i'm not blaming them, i'm just saying what happens — they're playing with the mask, so the mask is over, and they're touching it. and then they're touching the plate. that can't be good.""

a majority of americans — democrats and republicans alike — say they support regular mask-wearing and do so in their daily lives, according to recent public polling."
Exclusive: $1 billion-plus riot damage is most expensive in insurance history,21,itys1b,https://www.axios.com/riots-cost-property-damage-276c9bcc-a455-4067-b06a-66f9db4cea9c.html,8,1600301927.0,[deleted],"the vandalism and looting following the death of george floyd at the hands of the minneapolis police will cost the insurance industry more than any other violent demonstrations in recent history, axios has learned.

why it matters: the protests that took place in 140 u.s. cities this spring were mostly peaceful, but the arson, vandalism and looting that did occur will result in at least $1 billion to $2 billion of paid insurance claims — eclipsing the record set in los angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of the police officers who brutalized rodney king.

how it works: a company called property claim services (pcs) has tracked insurance claims related to civil disorder since 1950. it classifies anything over $25 million in insured losses as a ""catastrophe,"" and reports that the unrest this year (from may 26 to june 8) will cost the insurance industry far more than any prior one.

that number could be as much as $2 billion and possibly more, according to the insurance information institute (or triple-i), which compiles information from pcs as well as other firms that report such statistics.

the protests related to george floyd's death are also different because they are so widespread. ""it's not just happening in one city or state — it's all over the country,"" loretta l. worters of the triple-i tells axios.

""and this is still happening, so the losses could be significantly more.""

yes, but: these losses are small compared with those stemming from natural disasters like hurricanes and the wildfires that are consuming the u.s. west.

hurricane isaias will cost $3 billion-$5 billion in insurance losses, per risk management solutions (rms).

the wildfire season has just begun this year, but already insured losses are at $1.5 billion, triple-i tells axios. that compares with $18 billion for all of 2018 and $15 billion for all of 2017 (the 2019 numbers aren't available yet).

""in california alone, wildfires have already burned 2.2 million acres in 2020 — more than any year on record. and the 2020 wildfire season still has a way to go,"" says worters of triple-i.

between the lines: pcs, a unit of verisk analytics, won't reveal an exact dollar figure from this year's violence because it wants to sell that data to clients. but it says the insured losses far outstrip the prior record of $775 million from the 1992 rodney king demonstrations.

all previous catastrophes — as classified by the insurance industry — happened in a particular city. this was the first that happened not just in multiple cities, but in 20 states.

""not only is this the first, this is the first — kind of with a cymbal crash,"" tom johansmeyer, head of pcs, tells axios.

the backstory: the last time pcs compiled insurance losses for a ""civil disorder event"" was in april 2015, when rioting erupted in baltimore in the wake of the death of freddie gray from a neck injury while being transported in a police van.

""those riots did not result in insured losses reaching $25 million when it occurred, pcs’s threshold for a catastrophe,"" according to an article on the insurance information institute's website that catalogs insured losses of this magnitude. (it shows that most of the biggest episodes happened in the 1960s).

""for the first time, pcs has designated this civil disorder and those that followed across the united states from may 26 to june 8 as a multi-state catastrophe event.""

also on the top 10 list: the 1965 watts riots in los angeles; the 1967 detroit riot that inspired the gordon lightfoot song ""black day in july""; and the great new york city blackout of 1977.

of note: while u.s. companies have learned the hard way that their insurance doesn't cover business interruption related to the coronavirus, most policies emphatically do cover riot-related losses.

what to watch: the insurance industry is rolling up its sleeves in anticipation of potential unrest following the november election.

""there could be riots that lead to significant losses that would meet our reporting thresholds,"" johansmeyer said.

HHS spokesman Caputo to take medical leave after reportedly accusing CDC officials of plotting against Trump,25,iu0b63,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/16/hhs-spokesman-caputo-to-take-medical-leave-after-reportedly-accusing-cdc-officials-of-plotting-against-trump.html,4,1600306547.0,,"michael caputo, a former trump campaign official who took over as top spokesman for the department of health and human services earlier this year, will take a 60-day leave of absence, hhs announced wednesday.

the move comes after caputo, who led the agency's communications on the coronavirus pandemic, reportedly said in a now-deleted video posted sunday on his personal facebook page that scientists at the centers for disease control and prevention were engaged in ""sedition"" against president donald trump.

in caputo's streamed remarks on sunday, he said there is a ""resistance unit"" within the cdc, adding that scientists at the agency ""haven't gotten out of their sweatpants except for meetings at coffee shops"" to plot ""how they're going to attack donald trump next,"" the new york times reported.

when asked about caputo's comments on wednesday, cdc director dr. robert redfield said they ""deeply saddened"" him.

hhs also announced that paul alexander, an advisor to caputo who was working for the agency on a temporary basis, ""will be leaving the department.""

in a statement obtained by cnbc, caputo said he will use the leave of absence ""to pursue necessary screenings for a lymphatic issue discovered last week.""

caputo added that he has been losing weight for months and had delayed seeing his doctor. he also said ""violent threats leveled at me and my family back in buffalo"" have contributed to his stress levels. in the statement, he thanked dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, for conferring with caputo's personal physician.

""but every american battling covid — in every city in every state across the nation — has been under enormous pressure. i am just one of them,"" he said. ""our family is blessed. we urge all americans to see their family doctor for the healthcare they need but have missed for months during this crisis. do it today.""

both alexander and caputo have been at the center of recent reports over alleged political meddling within the cdc. last week, multiple outlets reported that caputo and alexander were interfering with internal cdc affairs, including the publication of the agency's morbidity and mortality weekly reports. those serve as the main channel through which the cdc communicates with physicians and public health specialists across the country.

when reached for comment about the reports, caputo said last week in a statement to cnbc that ""our intention is to make sure that evidence, science-based data drives policy through this pandemic — not ulterior deep state motives in the bowels of cdc.""

caputo also defended alexander, a part-time university lecturer from mcmaster university in canada, saying that he ""is an oxford educated epidemiologist"" and that ""he has been encouraged to share his opinions with other scientists.""

politico reported last week that alexander had also been trying to control what fauci, a white house coronavirus advisor, said in media appearances. when asked about the report last week, fauci said any attempt to control what he says is a ""fool's errand.""

""anybody that tries to tell me what to say publicly, if they know anything about me, realize that's a fool's errand,"" he said. ""no one is ever going to pressure me or muzzle me to say anything publicly, so whoever that person was that wrote that memo, it was a waste of an email.""

white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany told reporters wednesday she is ""not going to weigh into any personnel matters.""

ryan murphy will take over the day-to-day operations as chief spokesman for hhs while caputo is on leave, the agency said.

the internal shake-up comes after democratic lawmakers launched an investigation earlier this week into alleged political interference at the cdc by trump appointees.

the democrats said in a letter to hhs secretary alex azar and redfield that they seek ""to determine the scope of political interference with cdc's scientific reports and other efforts to combat the pandemic, the impact of this interference on cdc's mission, whether this interference is continuing, and the steps that congress may need to take to stop it before more americans die needlessly.""

caputo was named in the letter.

also earlier this week, senate minority leader chuck schumer called for azar to resign, citing ""chaos and mismanagement in his own agency.""

Climate science contrarian installed in upper-level NOAA position | Deputy assistant secretary job goes to author of reality-defying nonsense.,56,iu4oda,https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/climate-science-contrarian-installed-in-upper-level-noaa-position/,4,1600319001.0,,"the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently hired a new person in an upper-level deputy assistant secretary position. normally, this would not be too surprising or newsworthy, but this is an exception. joining noaa as the “deputy assistant secretary of commerce for environmental observation and prediction” is university of delaware professor david legates—a well-known contrarian who rejects the science of human-caused climate change.

the position apparently reports to acting head of noaa neil jacobs, although the circumstances of the hire are unknown. ars asked noaa about the duties of this position, but the agency has not responded. jacobs was entangled in the fallout from president trump’s inaccurate tweets about hurricane dorian that culminated in a forecast map doctored with a black marker. a pair of investigations found that jacobs capitulated to directives from the office of commerce secretary wilbur ross and the white house, releasing an unsigned noaa statement that sought to rescue the president’s inaccurate statements by mildly admonishing the forecasters who corrected him.

the washington post reported that legates’ department at the university of delaware informed students in an email that he would not be teaching in the fall semester while noting, “david hopes to be back at ud in the spring.”

whatever it is, i’m against it

legates was delaware’s state climatologist between 2005 and 2011. although he started his career working on precipitation data and patterns, he is primarily known for rejecting, at every opportunity, the human role in climate change. he’s a frequent contributor to work by the heartland institute—a “think tank” that opposes the facts of climate science. when ars visited a heartland conference in 2015, legates was there, presenting a talk that waved away trends in us rainfall extremes as an artifact of measurement changes.

legates was also a lead author of a 2018 heartland “climate change reconsidered” report, which adopts the format and trappings of the intergovernmental panel on climate change—even calling its coterie of bloggers the “nongovernmental international panel on climate change”—but presents long-debunked nonsense.

for example, the report’s summary concludes, “there is no compelling scientific evidence of long-term trends in global mean temperatures or climate impacts that exceed the bounds of natural variability.” it cannot be overstated how demonstrably false that is.

why limit your trolling to climate?

in april, legates co-authored a blog post on the heartland institute website about covid-19 models that linked to a conspiratorial post about “inflated” death numbers.

“it is vital that they recheck the models and assumptions” the post reads, “and distinguish between covid-19 deaths actually due to the virus... and not just associated with or compounded by it, but primarily due to age, obesity, pneumonia, or other issues. we can’t afford a cure that’s worse than the disease—or a prolonged and deadly national economic shutdown that could have been shortened by updated and corrected models.”

the post then turns to criticize climate models, falsely claiming that they “have always overstated the warming.” it even repeats the ancient canard that climate scientists “alter” temperature data. these views are certainly relevant given the “environmental observation and prediction” in legates’ noaa job title.

legates also contributed to a 2019 heartland brief on sea level that falsely stated:

contrary to the ipcc’s statement that it is “very likely” sea-level rise is accelerating, burton (2018) reports the highest quality coastal tide gauges from around the world show no evidence of acceleration since the 1920s or before, and therefore no evidence of being affected by rising atmospheric co 2 levels.

(that burton citation is not a peer-reviewed study, by the way, but simply a website that plots tide-gauge data.)

in 2015, legates and several other heartland regulars published a paper titled “why models run hot: results from an irreducibly simple climate model.” their model projected no more than 1°c of global warming through the year 2100, in stark contrast to published research. this was because the paper claimed that the sensitivity of earth’s climate to greenhouse gases was far lower than estimated by climate scientists.

the problem, according to a response published by a group of scientists, was that their model was a mess. for starters, it assumed that the climate system responded instantaneously to increased greenhouse gases, thumbing its nose at the existence of the ocean. and some of the values controlling their model were selected by analogy to voltage-controlled electronic circuits, because they believed the system was too stable to have significant amplifying feedbacks.

but most unbelievably, the paper had declined to compare its model to observed global temperatures—because the modeled temperatures were far lower than reality. instead, they created a hypothetical global temperature record based on cherry-picked periods and then treated the successful fit as evidence of their model’s accuracy. (real climate models actually match real temperature data.)

everyone says i’m wrong because i’m right

legates is also in the tiny rolodex of credentialed contrarians who get invited to government hearings to testify that climate science is “unsettled.” in 2014, he testified before the senate environment and public works committee that climate change is not harming agriculture in the united states. he claimed that the data shows no changes in drought and criticized the use of climate models as scientific tools.

“droughts that have happened in the past are likely to occur again, and with likely similar frequencies and intensities; thus, preparation for their return is a better strategy than trying to mitigate them through draconian co 2 emission control policies,” he testified.

much of his testimony focused not science but on his supposed persecution for “dissent.” like other contrarians obsessed with pushing conclusions that the evidence does not support, he chalks up the rejected papers (and challenges to his status as state climatologist) not to his own mistakes but to a conspiracy to squash “independent thinking.” this imagined persecution earned legates a “courage in defense of science award” at that 2015 heartland institute conference.

ideas like the above have become common from politicians and performative committee hearings, but they’ll now be represented at the upper level of noaa—an agency tasked with critical real-time monitoring and research.

this is part of a pattern under the trump administration, of course. while meeting with california officials about record-setting wildfires on tuesday, president trump disregarded concerns about the inescapable reality of warming temperatures, saying, “it’ll start getting cooler, you just watch.” when california secretary for natural resources wade crowfoot responded that he wished science agreed, trump added, “i don’t think science knows, actually.”"
"Exclusive: U.S. pushes arms sales surge to Taiwan, needling China - sources",74,iu914j,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan-arms-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-pushes-arms-sales-surge-to-taiwan-needling-china-sources-idUSKBN2671M4,7,1600333244.0,,"washington (reuters) - the united states plans to sell as many as seven major weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones to taiwan, four people familiar with the discussions said, as the trump administration ramps up pressure on china.

pursuing seven sales at once is a rare departure from years of precedent in which u.s. military sales to the island were spaced out and carefully calibrated to minimize tensions with beijing.

but the trump administration has become more aggressive with china in 2020 and the sales would land as relations between beijing and washington are at their lowest point in decades over accusations of spying, a lingering trade war and disputes about the spread of the novel coronavirus.

at the same time taiwan's desire to buy weapons increased after president tsai ing-wen was re-elected here in january and has made strengthening taiwan's defenses a top priority.

taiwan is china’s most sensitive territorial issue. beijing says it is a chinese province, and has denounced the trump administration’s support for the island.

washington has been eager to create a military counterbalance to chinese forces, building on an effort known within the pentagon as “fortress taiwan”, as beijing’s military makes increasingly aggressive moves in the region.

taiwan’s defense ministry said the reported package was a “media assumption,” and that it handled weapons purchase talks and assessments in a low-key, confidential way, so could not offer public comment until there was a formal u.s. notification of any sales to congress.

taiwan’s military is well-trained and well-equipped with mostly u.s.-made hardware, but china has a huge numerical superiority and is adding advanced equipment of its own.

the weapons packages from lockheed martin co lmt.n, boeing ba.n and general atomics are moving their way through the export process, three people familiar with the status of the deals on capitol hill said, and a notification to congress is expected within weeks.

one industry source said president donald trump was slated to be briefed on the packages this week by secretary of state mike pompeo. some of the deals had been requested by taiwan more than a year ago, but are only now being moved through the approval process. a state department spokesman declined comment.

a senior u.s. official, citing chinese assertiveness in the taiwan strait, said: “there is no equilibrium today. it is out of balance. and i think that is dangerous.”

trump's white house has made an here effort to export weapons to u.s. allies trying to bolster their defenses, decrease dependence on u.s. troops while boosting u.s. companies and jobs.

as he fights for re-election on nov. 3, trump and republican supporters have ramped up their rhetoric against beijing and sought to portray democratic opponent joe biden as soft on china.

other factors include taiwan’s bigger defense budget, and the fear in taiwan that if trump loses, biden would be less willing to sell the u.s.’s most advanced weapons to them.

taiwan’s interest in u.s. weapons and equipment is not new. the island is bolstering its defenses in the face of what it sees as increasingly threatening moves by beijing, such as regular chinese air force and naval exercises near taiwan.

the senior u.s. official said taiwan’s increased defense spending was a good step, but it had to do more.

“taiwan, frankly, needs to do more in order to ensure that they indigenously have an ability to deter chinese aggression,” the official said.

deals

drones that can see over the horizon for surveillance and targeting, coupled with advanced missiles and coastal defenses that include smart mines and anti-submarine capabilities to impede a sea invasion, have been discussed at the highest levels to make taiwan more difficult to attack, like a “porcupine”, according to industry and congressional sources.

a lockheed martin-made high mobility artillery rocket system (himars), essentially a truck-based rocket launcher, is among the weapons taiwan wants, people familiar with the negotiations said. taiwan also seeks to buy sophisticated anti-tank missiles.

in early august, reuters reported that washington is negotiating the sale of at least four of its large sophisticated aerial drones to taiwan for what could be about $600 million.

also under discussion are land-based boeing-made harpoon anti-ship missiles to serve as a coastal defense against cruise missiles.

other systems include ""underwater sea mines and other capabilities to deter amphibious landing, or immediate attack,"" taiwan's de facto ambassador here to united states said in july."

berlin (ap) — the austrian government has spoken up to correct u.s. president donald trump’s claim that people in its country live in “forest cities.”

trump recently cited austria and other european countries as models of good forest management that u.s. states like california, which has seen devastating wildfires lately, should learn from.

calling in to fox news on tuesday, trump said, “you look at countries, austria, you look at so many countries. they live in the forest, they’re considered forest cities. so many of them. and they don’t have fires like this. and they have more explosive trees.”

in an article thursday for the london-based independent, austria’s agriculture minister sought to set the record straight.

“there have been both serious and humorous conversations on social media about the ‘exploding trees’ (trump) mentioned, as well as the fact that he claimed we live within ‘forest cities’ which never catch fire,” elisabeth koestinger wrote. “as austrians, fortunately blessed with a healthy sense of humour, we normally take such clichés about our country in our stride.”

“however, the gravity of current events make trump’s words much more worrying — after all, right at this moment, thousands of people are fighting horrendous wildfires in life-or-death situations,” she said.

“in reality, austria is a country situated in the heart of europe, where people do not live in the forest, but rather with the forest and in a close, sustainable relationship with the natural environment,” koestinger wrote.

sustainable management of forests, which cover almost half the nation’s territory, is important, she added, but not because they’re more combustible.

“to clarify: no, we don’t have any exploding trees in austria,” koestinger said, though she did confirm trump’s assertion that “we have found a way to give our trees the space they need.”

full coverage: wildfires

“this does not make us ‘forest people,’ but shows how important understanding our environment and our natural resources is,” she said, adding that “taking climate change seriously and mitigating its effects is a huge part of this.”

trump caused mirth in finland two years ago, when he claimed the nordic nation spends “ a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things” to clear forest floors to prevent fires."
Barr Blasts His Own Prosecutors: 'All Power Is Vested In The Attorney General',212,iujn20,https://www.npr.org/2020/09/17/913891515/in-fiery-speech-barr-assails-his-own-prosecutors-for-political-headhunting,85,1600378749.0,,"barr blasts his own prosecutors: 'all power is vested in the attorney general'

updated at 8:22 a.m. et

attorney general bill barr blasted his own justice department prosecutors as a ""permanent bureaucracy"" that all too often abuse their power to go after high-profile targets in a process he likened to ""headhunting.""

in remarks wednesday to a largely conservative audience celebrating constitution day at hillsdale college, the leader of the justice department asserted that he's the one who should make the big calls in cases of national interest.

""the notion that line prosecutors should make the final decisions at the department of justice is completely crazy,"" barr said.

""under the law, all prosecutorial power is vested in the attorney general. and these people are agents of the attorney general. as i say to fbi agents, 'whose agent do you think you are?' now, i don't say this in a pompous way, but that is the chain of authority and legitimacy in the department of justice.""

barr didn't mention particular prosecutions, but he's faced steady criticism over his decisions to intervene in cases to help people close to president trump, including longtime political adviser roger stone and former national security adviser michael flynn. some prosecutors have quit in response to barr's interventions. two current justice employees testified last summer on capitol hill about political interference at a whistleblower hearing.

the attorney general saved most of his ire for his own justice department ranks. at one point, he likened junior prosecutors to children in preschool.

""letting the most junior members set the agenda might be a good philosophy for a montessori preschool, but it's no way to run a federal agency,"" barr said.

later, in arguing for more ""detachment"" from his prosecutors, barr referenced lines from c.s. lewis, who frequently wrote about religious themes: ""'it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies,'"" barr said. ""'the robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. they may be more likely to go to heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a hell of earth.'""

the comments drew reaction from former justice officials, including president barack obama's attorney general, eric holder, and onetime civil division chief jody hunt, who left his post as assistant attorney general earlier this year.

during a question-and-answer period after his formal remarks, barr reiterated his concerns about voting by mail in the november presidential race, echoing unfounded claims by the president about possible fraud without providing evidence other than ""common sense.""

barr took a swipe at the legal skills of former staff members for special counsel robert mueller, who investigated russia's attack on the 2016 election and whose report detailed how the trump campaign welcomed that interference.

in response to a question about religious services and first amendment freedoms during the coronavirus pandemic, barr said this of the idea of national covid-19 lockdowns: ""other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in american history.""

later, he addressed the black lives matter movement. ""they're not interested in black lives. they're interested in props, a small number of blacks who are killed by police during conflicts with police — usually less than a dozen a year — who they can use as props to achieve a much broader political agenda."""
"FBI director confirms ""very, very active"" Russian efforts to interfere in election",433,iupmy2,https://www.axios.com/fbi-director-russia-election-ac152f12-a992-4882-8677-b7d5d16dc918.html,68,1600397007.0,,"fbi director chris wray on thursday told congress the bureau has seen ""very active efforts by the russians to influence our election in 2020,"" primarily to ""denigrate vice president biden and what the russians see as kind of an anti-russian establishment.""

why it matters: it confirms previous statements from various intelligence officials about russia's interference activities, which continue with less than 50 days until the election.

the efforts have been through proxies on social media and have aimed to ""sow divisiveness and discord,"" wray said.

yes, but: unlike in 2016, the russians have not targeted election infrastructure, according to wray.

what they're saying: wray said that his biggest concern related to election security is the ""steady drumbeat of misinformation and sort of amplification of smaller cyber intrusions"" that could sow distrust in the results of the election.

the fbi director called for trust in the electoral process, but said he fears ""people will take on a feeling of futility because of all of the noise and confusion that’s generated, and that’s a very hard problem to combat.""

on thursday evening, president trump responded to wray's testimony, tweeting: ""but chris, you don't see any activity from china, even though it is a far greater threat than russia, russia, russia. they will both, plus others, be able to interfere in our 2020 election without totally vulnerable unsolicited (counterfeit?) ballot scam.

the big picture: wray also told lawmakers that ""antifa"" is a political ideology and not an organization as has been suggested by trump, who has proposed treating antifa supporters like terrorists.

wray did not dispute that individual antifa activists or right-wing extremists were a serious concern for the election, saying solo actors, or so-called “lone wolves,” with easy access to weapons were a primary concern.

"Barr calls coronavirus lockdowns ""the greatest intrusion on civil liberties"" since slavery",85,iuqbld,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/17/william-barr-coronavirus-lockdowns-slavery-416776,13,1600399063.0,,"politico dispatch: september 18 it's the semester nobody wanted: kids sitting at home behind monitors, teachers trying to figure out how to unmute themselves and parents stuck wondering whether their children will lose a year of education.

during the event hosted by hillsdale college, barr also defended his intervention in high-profile justice department cases and compared career prosecutors to preschoolers.

“what do you mean by interfere? under the law, all prosecutorial power is vested in the attorney general, and these people are agents of the attorney general,” barr said. “and as i say, fbi agents, whose agent do you think you are?”

the attorney general specifically attacked justice department prosecutors who had made charging and sentencing decisions with which he disagreed.

“name one successful organization where the lowest level employees’ decisions are deemed sacrosanct. there aren’t any,” barr said, according to a justice department copy of his remarks.

“letting the most junior members set the agenda might be a good philosophy for a montessori preschool, but it’s no way to run a federal agency.”

barr asserted that “individual prosecutors can sometimes become headhunters, consumed with taking down their target,” and that “smart, ambitious lawyers have sought to amass glory by prosecuting prominent public figures since the roman republic.”

during an interview last week while on an official trip to chicago to discuss an anti-crime initiative, barr said he believes the upcoming election is the most significant of his lifetime.

“as an attorney general, i’m not supposed to get into politics ... for example, attorneys general don’t go out and campaign and so forth,” barr told wgn radio’s john kass. “i think we were getting into a position where we were going to find ourselves irrevocably committed to the socialist path and i think if trump loses this election that — that will be the case ... i think there’s now a clear fork in the road for our country.”

“i think increasingly the message of the democrats appears to be: biden or no peace ... that is rule by the mob and we’re approaching that,” barr added.

in the same interview, the attorney general also endorsed trump’s view that he is besieged by the federal bureaucracy, which the president often derides as the “deep state.”

“there are undoubtedly many people in the government who surreptitiously work to thwart the administration,” barr said.

white house chief of staff mark meadows defended the attorney general thursday morning amid fallout from barr’s latest remarks, saying the trump administration was working to “restore the integrity to the department of justice and the fbi.”

“when we talk about setting priorities, bill barr is exactly right. we need to make sure that everyone is treated equally under the law,” meadows told fox news.

“but, unfortunately, some in — some would say it’s the deep state. i would just say that it’s actually the swamp that continues to try to make sure a political agenda is driven instead of law and order and justice for all,” he added.

barr’s remarks triggered a withering outpouring of criticism from former justice department officials, including both political appointees and career staffers, who accused the attorney general of denigrating the agency’s dedicated career employees.

“though dangerous, barr is becoming increasingly absurd,” former attorney general eric holder wrote on twitter. “when i was at doj — regardless of my ultimate authority — i saw the career staff as trusted colleagues, not pre-schoolers. to my friends at doj, know that this nation values and supports you. i do.”

“this is the ag demeaning the career men and women of his own department, comparing them to preschoolers,” former deputy attorney general sally yates tweeted. “these dedicated public servants are working hard every day to try to get it right. they deserve his respect, not disdain.”

among those pushing back against barr’s remarks was jody hunt, a veteran career lawyer at the department who served as a trump administration political appointee and as chief of staff to attorney general jeff sessions.

hunt, who stepped down in july after about two decades at doj, fired off multiple twitter messages rebutting barr.

“not accurate to suggest that career officials are less experienced than political appointees. many supervisors are career officials, who often have more experience than politicals. and the career officials generally work hard to apply principled positions across administrations,” hunt wrote.

house majority whip jim clyburn (d-s.c.), however, fiercely condemned barr’s comment likening coronavirus restrictions to slavery, calling it one of the “most ridiculous, tone-deaf, god-awful things i’ve ever heard.”

“it is incredible the chief law enforcement officer in this country would equate human bondage to expert advice to save lives. slavery was not about saving lives. it was about devaluing lives,” clyburn, the highest-ranking african american in congress, told cnn.

clyburn also noted that the trump administration never announced a nationwide lockdown order, instead deferring to state and local governments to impose a patchwork of stay-at-home mandates and other measures limiting americans’ movements.

“it would have been great if we had a national lockdown, so that people’s lives would be saved and our children would be going on with their lives today as they should be,” clyburn said.

“but that is just what we’re up against here,” he continued. “two people in charge of running the law enforcement of this country who are absolutely tone-deaf to what it takes to be great leaders. they are driving this country into a direction that no one ever thought they would see in our lifetime.”

rep. hakeem jeffries of new york, the fifth-highest ranking house democrat, said barr was wrong to describe slavery as a form of “restraint,” and that it actually represented “one of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed.”

“the casual way in which he referenced it pretty much tells you all you need to know about bill barr and his inability to process the dynamics, particularly as it relates to the systemic racism that has been in the soil of america for 401 years,” jeffries told cnn.

republican lawmakers offered a mixed reaction to barr’s comments.

“that’s not the analogy i would use,” senate judiciary committee chairman lindsey graham said about the attorney general’s comparison. “i think what he’s trying to say is that the country has — you know, it’s been tough. we’ve had to shelter in place and our lifestyle has changed dramatically. but, no, i would not compare it to slavery. probably the only thing to compare it to would be 1918.”

“any time you talk about slavery, it’s going to be inflammatory,” said sen. john cornyn of texas. “i think some of the lockdowns have been arbitrary and inconsistent, and i think there are civil liberties concerns. i share some of those concerns. but i probably would not use those words. i would not use those words.”

cornyn’s texas counterpart, sen. ted cruz, was more supportive of barr.

“imprisoning 300 million people in their homes for nine months has no precedent in modern times,” cruz said. he criticized the press for focusing on the remarks, but also said barr may have overlooked another major abridgement of civil liberties: the internment of japanese americans during world war ii.

barr’s remarks about slavery were not the only controversial statements he made wednesday regarding matters of race. he also took aim at the black lives matter movement, while appearing to express agreement with its stated core belief.

“who can quarrel with the proposition, ‘black lives matter?’” barr said. “but they’re not interested in black lives. they’re interested in props — a small number of blacks who are killed by police during conflict with police ... who they can use as props to achieve a much broader political agenda.”

the attorney general’s appearance at the hillsdale college event came as the wall street journal reported wednesday night that he had instructed federal prosecutors in a conference call last week to more aggressively charge violent demonstrators at anti-racism protests — including under a sedition law that would accuse them of plotting to overthrow the u.s. government.

sen. rand paul (r-ky.) showed support thursday for barr’s reported remarks on the call, saying federal law enforcement officials “have to draw the line.”

“my preference is always that law and order, for the most part — disrupting the public, people mobbing people, not letting them move — would be local crimes and should be adjudicated

locally,” paul told fox business.

“but there’s sort of an abdication going on on the left,” he said. “they’ve decided that, you know, it’s a summer of love, and everybody loves each other, and this is the first amendment.”

sen. jeff merkley (d-ore.), whose state has seen more than 100 consecutive days of protest in portland against racial injustice and police brutality, said he was “astounded” by reports of the attorney general’s call with prosecutors and that barr was proposing “politicizing protest.”"
Trump contradicts CDC director on vaccines: 'he was confused',18,iuu472,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-trump-vaccine-idUSKBN2673IR,16,1600411268.0,,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump predicted on wednesday at least 100 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine could be distributed in by the end of 2020, contradicting a top government health official trump dismissed as confused.

hours earlier, robert redfield, director of the federal centers for disease control and prevention, said a covid-19 vaccine could be broadly rolled out by the middle of next year or a little later.

“no i think he made a mistake when he said that,” trump said, telling reporters he called redfield. “that’s incorrect information. “i believe he was confused. i think he just misunderstood the question, probably.”

redfield, head of the federal government’s disease control agency, made his comments in testimony before a u.s. senate panel

he said general availability of a vaccine could come by “late second quarter, third quarter 2021.”

a vaccine could be ready as soon as this november or december, redfield said, adding that limited first doses could go to those who were most vulnerable. but “in order to have enough of us immunized to have immunity, i think it’s going to take six to nine months,” he added."

below, abc news fact checks what biden said during the town hall event. please refresh for updates:

biden misstated attorney general's comment on slavery, lockdowns

biden's claim: former vice president joe biden was asked by cnn's anderson cooper to respond to those ""who say it's individual liberty to not wear a mask."" biden said, ""well let me tell you something. you know i -- what bill barr recently said is outrageous. that it's like slavery. you're taking away freedom. i would tell you what takes away your freedom. what takes away your freedom is not being able to see your kid, not being able to go to the football game or baseball game, not being able to see your mom or dad sick in the hospital, not being able to do the things. that's what's cost us our freedom.""

fact check: biden seemed to be referencing comments made by attorney general bill barr wednesday at a constitution day celebration hosted by michigan's hillsdale college.

at the event, barr said that ""other than slavery"" coronavirus lockdowns were ""the greatest intrusion of civil liberties in american history."" the attorney general's remarks got almost immediate push back from lawmakers and others who condemned his language.

but while barr was commenting on lockdowns caused by the virus, biden was responding to a question about wearing masks. barr did not make any comparison between mask wearing and slavery wednesday.

biden was trying to call attention to barr's comments as at odds with american history – echoing much of the criticism the attorney general received.

later in the town hall, biden referenced the remarks again after cooper asked him about them -- but incorrectly said that barr said lockdowns were equivalent to slavery; barr said slavery was worse.

""quite frankly, they're sick,"" biden said of the comments. ""think about it. did you ever think, any of you, you'd hear attorney general say that following the recommendations of the scientific community to save you and other people's lives is equivalent to slavery?""

biden mixes up source for impact of masks

biden's claim: when cooper asked how biden will get the proper messaging out to all americans to keep them informed as to how to properly protect themselves and others from this pandemic, the former vice president said that even though he does have the authority to require a universal mask mandate, he would propose safety guidelines for states to follow and implement.

""i cannot mandate people wearing masks, but we've just been told, if we should expect another 215,000 dead by january, but if we wore a mask, we would save 100,000 of those lives,"" biden said. ""his own cdc director contradicted him recently. he said if, in fact, you just wore this mask, nothing else but this mask, you would save between now and january another 100,000 lives.""

fact check: the current director of the centers for disease control and prevention, robert redfield, has not, in fact, claimed that 100,000 lives could be saved if americans wore masks universally.

biden may have been referring to a former cdc director, tom frieden, who tweeted on monday: ""masks work, and 100,000+ deaths in the us could quite possibly have been prevented, simply and cheaply, if we all wore masks, washed our hands, and watched our distance.""

during his senate testimony on wednesday, redfield did state that masks may be a more effective protection against the coronavirus than any potential vaccine.

biden could have also been referencing a forecast model created by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington, which predicted that if americans wore masks universally, nearly 117,000 lives could be spared by jan. 1, 2021.

later in the town hall, biden did appear to refer to the ihme model, saying there could be another 215,000 american lives lost by january. nearly 200,000 americans have died so far, and the ihme model currently projects there could be a total of 415,000 coronavirus related deaths in the u.s. by january.

biden would not be first president without ivy league degree

biden's claim: ""when you guys started talking on television about 'biden, if he wins will be the first person without an ivy league degree to be elected president.' i said, 'who the hell makes you think i need an ivy league degree to be president?' i'm not joking.""

fact check: despite his suggestion, biden would not be the first president without an ivy league degree, as several presidents in the country's history did not receive a college degree at all.

biden would be the first president since ronald reagan to be elected president without an ivy league education.

the biden-harris ticket is the first since the 1984 ticket of walter mondale and geraldine ferraro to have two non-ivy league graduates and if successful, the first winning ticket since 1976 with jimmy carter and mondale.

how about: the 2020 democratic nominees do make history with sen. kamala harris as the first graduate from a historically black college and university to appear on a major party ticket.

biden misleads when saying he wants to grow fracking industry

biden claim: biden was asked if he'd ""support the continuation of fracking safely"" and ""growing the industry.""

""yes, i do,"" biden said, later adding, ""we can put to work right away 250,000 people from the iron workers and other disciplines making union wages, capping those wells that are leaking methane and are a danger to the community.""

fact check: biden's response that he supported the continuation of fracking accurately reflected his environmental plan, but biden doesn't want to add new fracking on public lands. he wants to move away from fracking to eventually get net-zero emissions. so when he answered yes to ""growing the industry,"" it was misleading.

at the town hall, biden was challenged on why fracking should continue if it contributes to climate change. he argued a transition to clear energy was necessary to keep people employed.

""fracking has to continue because we need a transition,"" he said. ""we're going to get to net zero emissions by 2050 and we'll get to net zero power emissions by 2035. but there is no rationale to eliminate right now fracking, number one. number two, those jobs that are out there, whether it's a ibew worker or whether it's an iron worker or the steel worker.""

biden's environmental plan calls for an end to fossil fuel subsidies and for a massive investment in clean energy, including training fossil fuel workers for clean energy jobs.

during an address in august, biden said, ""i am not banning fracking. let me say that again. i am not banning fracking, no matter how many times donald trump lies about me.""

in july 2019, biden was asked during a cnn debate if there would be a place for fossil fuels, like coal and fracking, in a biden administration. ""we would make sure it's eliminated,"" he answered. after his comment, biden's campaign clarified that he was referring to public land.

biden correctly characterized past statements on 'locking down' country

biden's claim: biden was asked about a recent interview he did with abc ""world news tonight"" anchor david muir.

""i was asked if, in fact, there was a national emergency, and every -- everyone -- all the experts said lock it down,"" biden said. ""we're not talking about locking down the whole country.""

fact check: biden fairly characterized the exchange he had with muir last month.

""you talk about the science. if you're sworn in come january, and -- and we have coronavirus and the flu combining, which many scientists have said is a real possibility, would you be prepared to shut this country down again?"" muir asked.

biden replied, ""i will be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus. that is the fundamental flaw of this administration's thinking to begin with. in order to keep the country running and moving and the economy growing, and people employed, you have to fix the virus, you have to deal with the virus.

""so if the scientists say shut it down?"" muir asked.

""i would shut it down, i would listen to the scientists,"" biden said.

at a news conference a couple weeks later, biden clarified his answer to muir.

""there's going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy,"" he said. ""i got asked by david muir a question, if i was asked to shut everything down. i took that as a generic question if -- am i going to follow the science? i am going to insist -- and i insist now, without any authority, that every responsible person in this country, when they're out in public or not with the cohort that they have lived with because they know they haven't spread it to their husband, wife, etc., that they wear a mask.""

biden went on to say he would look to set criteria for certain towns and areas and potentially lock those down, thus eliminating the need for a national shut down, and added: ""we're not talking about locking down the whole country.""

in any case, state and local officials -- not the president -- are responsible for most decisions about whether to shutter businesses and close schools and enact other coronavirus-related restrictions.

biden incorrectly states that trump hasn’t condemned white supremacists

biden’s claim: biden was asked by a retired police chief about the “violence taking place in our cities across this country.”

""i've condemned every form of violence, no matter what the source is,"" biden said. ""no matter what the source is. the president has yet to condemn, as you’ve probably noticed, the far-right and the white supremacists and those guys walking around with the ak-47s and not doing a damn thing about them.""

he added, ""i'm waiting for the day when he says, 'i condemn all those white supremacists, i condemn all those militia guys as much as i do every other organizational structure.'""

fact check: biden is correct that trump has not condemned white supremacists recently, but trump has done so in the past.

two days after violent clashes in charlottesville, virginia, in 2017 -- after first equating violence from white supremacists with those protesting -- trump said, “racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the kkk, neo-nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups.”

a month later, the president signed a congressional resolution condemning white supremacy.

in 2019, following shootings in el paso, texas, and dayton, ohio, trump said, “in one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. ”

""these sinister ideologies must be defeated. hate has no place in america. hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul,” he added.

though the president has condemned white supremacy, he has yet to condemn one of his supporters who screamed “white power” during a golf cart parade in florida, captured in a video he retweeted this year. he created a firestorm by sharing the video and thanking the ""great people"" of the florida residential community where the parade took place.

the president deleted the tweet hours later. at the time, white house deputy press secretary judd deere said in a statement, ""president trump is a big fan of the villages. he did not hear the one statement made on the video.""

Pence's former top aide says Trump called the coronavirus 'a good thing' because he didn't like shaking hands with 'disgusting' supporters,291,iv534g,https://www.businessinsider.com/video-aide-trump-didnt-want-to-shake-hands-disgusting-supporters-2020-9,129,1600460756.0,,"olivia troye, vice president mike pence's former top coronavirus task force adviser, slammed president donald trump's pandemic response in an interview and in a video published thursday.

in the video, troye describes a covid-19 task force meeting in which she says the president remarked that the pandemic might be a ""good thing"" because it prevented him from having to shake hands with ""disgusting people."" troye said the president was referring to his supporters.

""those disgusting people are the same people he claims to care about. these are the people who are still going to his rallies today, who have complete faith in who he is.""

trump is well known to be a germophobe and has publicly said he doesn't like shaking hands.

troye, who served as a senior aide to pence on homeland security and counterterrorism for two years, was deeply involved in the administration's coronavirus response. she said she left her white house job in august after concluding that the president was undermining efforts to keep americans safe.

""the truth is he doesn't actually care about anyone but himself,"" she said.

in an interview with the washington post published thursday, troye said that trump's pandemic response showed a ""flat-out disregard for human life"" and that he was more concerned with the economy and his reelection than with protecting americans.

""the president's rhetoric and his own attacks against people in his administration trying to do the work, as well as the promulgation of false narratives and incorrect information of the virus have made this ongoing response a failure,"" troye told the post.

troye also said any vaccine produced before the election might be dangerous.

""i would not tell anyone i care about to take a vaccine that launches prior to the election,"" she told the post. ""i would listen to the experts and the unity in pharma. and i would wait to make sure that this vaccine is safe and not a prop tied to an election.""

the white house and pence's team dismissed troye's allegations, characterizing her as a ""disgruntled"" former employee.

""ms. troye is a former detailee and a career department of homeland security staff member, who is disgruntled that her detail was cut short because she was no longer capable of keeping up with her day-to-day duties,"" pence's national security adviser, lt. general keith kellogg, told the post in a statement. ""ms. troye directly reported to me, and never once during her detail did she every express any concern regarding the administration's response to the coronavirus to anyone in her chain of command. by not expressing her concerns, she demonstrated an incredible lack of moral courage.""

judd deere, a white house spokesman, called troye's allegations ""flat-out inaccurate."""

U.S. Admits That Congressman Offered Pardon to Assange If He Covered Up Russia Links,213,iv6drn,https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-admits-that-putins-favorite-congressman-offered-pardon-to-assange-if-he-covered-up-russia-links,18,1600465653.0,,"london—lawyers representing the united states at julian assange’s extradition trial in britain have accepted the claim that the wikileaks founder was offered a presidential pardon by a congressman on the condition that he would help cover up russia’s involvement in hacking emails from the democratic national committee.

jennifer robinson, a lawyer, told the court that she had attended a meeting between assange, then republican congressman dana rohrabacher, and pro-trump troll charles johnson at assange’s hide-out, the ecuadorian embassy in london, on august 15, 2017.

robinson said the two americans claimed to be emissaries from washington and “wanted us to believe they were acting on behalf of the president.” the pair allegedly told assange that they could help grant him a pardon in exchange for him revealing information about the source of the wikileaks information that proved it was not the russians who hacked democratic emails.

“they stated that president trump was aware of and had approved of them coming to meet with mr. assange to discuss a proposal—and that they would have an audience with the president to discuss the matter on their return to washington, d.c.,” robinson said.

the white house has denied that trump took part in any such plan.

the claim itself is not new—assange’s lawyers previewed the allegation in a pre-trial hearing in february—but this is the first time robinson’s testimony has been heard in full. the wikileaks lawyer said rohrabacher offered assange the deal a year after emails that damaged hillary clinton in the presidential race had been published, when the russia investigation was gathering pace. the stolen dnc emails posted by wikileaks were hacked by russian operatives.

after robinson read her testimony in a london courtroom on friday, lawyers representing the u.s. accepted the witness statement as accurate and confirmed they had no intention of cross-examining the claim. they did dispute, however, that president donald trump gave his blessing for the pardon offer.

james lewis, who was representing the u.s. government, said, “the position of the government is we don't contest these things were said. we obviously do not accept the truth of what was said by others.”

rohrabacher, who was known as putin’s favorite congressman, partially corroborated the claim back in february, saying at the time, “i spoke to julian assange and told him if he would provide evidence about who gave wikileaks the emails i would petition the president to give him a pardon... he knew i could get to the president.”

rohrabacher said he followed up the meeting by calling then white house chief of staff john kelly to discuss the pardon. however, the ex-congressman said he never spoke to trump about it.

regardless, assange turned the offer down, his lawyers said.

assange has argued that he should not be extradited to the u.s. because the american case against him is politically motivated. he spent almost seven years hiding in the ecuadorian embassy in central london, claiming that he would be jailed in the u.s. if he wasn’t granted asylum. he was kicked out of the embassy last year.

if assange fails in his fight against extradition to the u.s., he will face 18 charges including conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which, his defense argues, could result in a prison sentence of 175 years."
“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate,35,iv6t7c,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate#intcid=recommendations_vf-trending-legacy_ef028640-c8fa-44f7-a9b6-49c8345c1b0f_popular4-1,9,1600467144.0,,"at the end of july, writing for vanity fair, i revealed that kushner had commissioned a robust federal covid-19 testing plan, only to abandon it before it could be implemented. one public health expert in frequent contact with the white house’s official coronavirus task force said a national plan likely fell out of favor in part because of a disturbingly cynical calculation: “the political folks believed that because [the virus] was going to be relegated to democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy.”

the story struck a nerve, partly because it painted a picture of what might have been: the administration could have invested in a national testing system at a scale that could have greatly limited the number of cases and deaths. instead the u.s. is on track to pass the grim milestone of 200,000 official covid-19 deaths this month. with just 4% of the world’s population, we now account for 20% of global deaths from the virus.

after the story was published, i pressed on with my reporting, hoping to learn more about kushner’s operation. i also wanted to better understand how the u.s., with its advanced medical systems, unmatched epidemiological know-how, and vaunted regulatory and public health institutions, could have fumbled the crisis so disastrously.

part of the answer almost certainly lies in the deep-seated belief, held by kushner, president trump, and their loyalists, that the federal government not only should not, but cannot play an effective leading role in responding to the pandemic, owing to its lumbering bureaucracy and onerous rules. at almost each step they have ignored the expertise of career officials and dismissed those with relevant experience as counterproductive meddlers. trump famously calls them the deep state. (a senior administration official denied this, saying, “the administration worked diligently to combine the best of the federal government and the private sector.”)

though even a well-coordinated federal response would have posed extreme challenges, it could have followed a well-marked trail. early on president trump could have unleashed the vast procurement powers of the federal government. the defense production act, a korean war–era law, allows the president to direct u.s. businesses to manufacture supplies—and gives the federal government first dibs on buying them. it was an obvious solution to a crisis that threatened the life of every american citizen.

“when the military needs to buy planes and make bullets, [it doesn’t] rely on the invisible hand of the free market,” said jeremy konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the center for global development who helped lead the obama administration’s response to the 2014 ebola outbreak. it uses the defense production act, “because it’s urgent,” he said.

but as experts watched and waited, trump shied away from invoking the act—which he later deployed haphazardly. (a senior administration official said president trump has invoked the defense production act “dozens of times when appropriate.”) instead he put his faith in the entrepreneurial instincts of his son-in-law. and kushner wasn’t interested in a big government solution.

kushner set out to reinvent what a response might look like, countering the deep state with what you might call a consultant state of his own creation. this might have been a worthwhile experiment had it not taken place in the context of a once-in-a-century public health catastrophe. as it is, it has led to organizational chaos, futile misadventures, and, most tellingly, a steadily climbing death rate. often communicating using the encrypted platform whatsapp, with little adherence to public records laws or federal contracting guidelines, kushner and a tight-knit group of allies he’s recruited have overseen a response riddled with special favors and political calculation. when they managed to procure lifesaving equipment, they used the surplus to shore up the president’s relationship with russia, hijacking a foreign aid agency in the process. and when they made a deal to bring drug manufacturing home to the united states, it blew up amid accusations of financial fraud.

“what you have going on here is smoke and mirrors,” said larry hall, who retired last year as director of the defense production act program division at fema. “you do not have a national strategy.”

from the beginning of his involvement in the pandemic, kushner set about sidelining government experts in favor of young, untested volunteers drawn from consulting firms and investment banks like mckinsey and goldman sachs. using personal emails and working under nondisclosure agreements, the volunteers were supposed to use their private sector savvy to source leads on protective equipment, then turn those leads over to the federal emergency management agency.

they operated at the direction of a former goldman sachs analyst and 2014 princeton university graduate named rachael baitel, who’d previously worked as a special assistant to ivanka trump at the white house. before getting into finance she’d also worked as a denim intern at ralph lauren. baitel’s group eventually spawned its own whistleblower, who alleged in a letter to a congressional subcommittee that the group maintained a spreadsheet titled “v.i.p. update” that gave priority to tips from political allies and friends, according to reports in the new york times and washington post.

a senior administration official involved in the task force said the young financial analysts provided an efficient solution to an unprecedented problem: dubious leads on supplies were flooding in from around the world. “in the first tier of a venture capital firm, you receive incoming calls from your investment firm. you vet them, you prequalify them.” those volunteers were able to “step through the mishmosh” and figure out the leads to pursue.

the journalist duff mcdonald, author of the firm: the story of mckinsey and its secret influence on american business, said it’s common for private sector ceos to use management consultants as a crutch when they are out of their depth—and don’t want to be blamed for what goes wrong. “kushner is at a loss for how to stall what is happening, so he’s doing the classic ‘analyst punt,’” mcdonald said, “going to his pals at mckinsey instead of people in the deep state who can do their jobs today. these are people who think, if you have a quantitative grasp, you can manage anything. i have no doubt that they’re telling kushner he’s a genius as well.”"
A Deal on Drug Prices Undone by White House Insistence on ‘Trump Cards’,11,ivgtgl,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/politics/trump-drug-prices.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage,3,1600499397.0,,"judd deere, a white house spokesman, would not comment specifically on the savings cards.

but he noted that mr. trump had held back on an executive order the industry fiercely opposed, which would tie some drug prices to the prices paid by other countries — called “most-favored nation” drug pricing. now the president is poised to link the prices that medicare pays for drugs administered in doctors’ offices to those paid even by social democracies in europe.

“president trump is working to ensure american patients are no longer forced to pay outrageously higher drug prices than those in other countries,” mr. deere said. “president trump signed four executive orders earlier this summer. however, he did not release the final executive order on ‘most-favored nation’ drug pricing, giving drug companies a month to come up with a counterproposal. negotiations did not produce an acceptable alternative, so the president is moving forward.”

it appears, then, the industry will have to confront the executive order it hoped to avoid.

last sunday, mr. trump released the order, which calls for the establishment of pilot programs tying some medicare drugs to prices abroad. they are unlikely to be established before the election, and the industry is almost sure to file suit in response.

“the administration has chosen to pursue the most favored nation policy — an irresponsible and unworkable policy that will give foreign governments a say in how america provides access to treatments and cures for seniors and people struggling with devastating diseases,” said stephen j. ubl, who heads phrma.

mr. meadows’s gambit illustrates the extent of the last-minute scramble by white house officials to score political victories ahead of november.

with the president’s response to the coronavirus widely criticized, the white house has grasped for other ways to impress voters. in recent days, mr. trump has extended a ban on offshore oil drilling off the coast of southern states, unveiled a multibillion-dollar aid package for hurricane-ravaged puerto rico, some of whose residents have migrated to must-win florida, announced another $14 billion in aid to farmers and plunged into middle east peacemaking.

some officials in the drug industry, though, said they found it mystifying that mr. meadows would play what they saw as political hardball with some of the same private-sector companies that mr. trump is pressuring to deliver the october surprise he craves the most: a coronavirus vaccine."

follow npr's coverage of ginsburg's death and the political aftermath here.

justice ruth bader ginsburg, the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal, cultural and feminist icon, died friday. the supreme court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas.

the court, in a statement, said ginsburg died at her home in washington, d.c., surrounded by family. she was 87.

""our nation has lost a justice of historic stature,"" chief justice john roberts said. ""we at the supreme court have lost a cherished colleague. today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember ruth bader ginsburg as we knew her, a tireless and resolute champion of justice.""

architect of the legal fight for women's rights in the 1970s, ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation's highest court, becoming its most prominent member. her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the supreme court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

just days before her death, as her strength waned, ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter clara spera: ""my most fervent wish is that i will not be replaced until a new president is installed.""

she knew what was to come. ginsburg's death will have profound consequences for the court and the country. inside the court, not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone, but with the court about to open a new term, the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in closely contested cases.

though roberts has a consistently conservative record in most cases, he has split from fellow conservatives in a few important ones this year, casting his vote with liberals, for instance, to protect at least temporarily the so-called dreamers from deportation by the trump administration, to uphold a major abortion precedent and to uphold bans on large church gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. but with ginsburg gone, there is no clear court majority for those outcomes.

upcoming political battle

indeed, a week after the upcoming presidential election, the court is for the third time scheduled to hear a challenge brought by republicans to the affordable care act, known as obamacare. in 2012, the high court upheld the law in a 5-4 ruling, with roberts casting the deciding vote and writing the opinion for the majority. but this time the outcome may well be different.

that's because ginsburg's death gives republicans the chance to tighten their grip on the court with another appointment by president trump so conservatives would have 6-3 majority. and that would mean that even a defection on the right would leave conservatives with enough votes to prevail in the obamacare case and many others.

at the center of the battle to achieve that will be senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. in 2016, he took a step unprecedented in modern times: he refused for nearly a year to allow any consideration of president barack obama's supreme court nominee.

back then, mcconnell's justification was the upcoming presidential election, which he said would allow voters a chance to weigh in on what kind of justice they wanted. but now, with the tables turned, mcconnell has made clear he will not follow the same course. instead he will try immediately to push through a trump nominee so as to ensure a conservative justice to fill ginsburg's liberal shoes, even if trump were to lose his reelection bid. asked what he would do in circumstances such as these, mcconnell said: ""oh, we'd fill it.""

so what happens in the coming weeks will be bare-knuckle politics, writ large, on the stage of a presidential election. it will be a fight ginsburg had hoped to avoid, telling justice john paul stevens shortly before his death that she hoped to serve as long as he did — until age 90.

""my dream is that i will stay on the court as long as he did,"" she said in an interview in 2019.

she didn't quite make it. but ruth bader ginsburg was nonetheless a historic figure. she changed the way the world is for american women. for more than a decade, until her first judicial appointment in 1980, she led the fight in the courts for gender equality. when she began her legal crusade, women were treated, by law, differently from men. hundreds of state and federal laws restricted what women could do, barring them from jobs, rights and even from jury service. by the time she donned judicial robes, however, ginsburg had worked a revolution.

that was never more evident than in 1996 when, as a relatively new supreme court justice, ginsburg wrote the court's 7-1 opinion declaring that the virginia military institute could no longer remain an all-male institution. true, ginsburg said, most women — indeed most men — would not want to meet the rigorous demands of vmi. but the state, she said, could not exclude women who could meet those demands.

""reliance on overbroad generalizations ... estimates about the way most men or most women are, will not suffice to deny opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description,"" ginsburg wrote.

she was an unlikely pioneer, a diminutive and shy woman, whose soft voice and large glasses hid an intellect and attitude that, as one colleague put it, was ""tough as nails.""

by the time she was in her 80s, she had become something of a rock star to women of all ages. she was the subject of a hit documentary, a biopic, an operetta, merchandise galore featuring her ""notorious rbg"" moniker, a time magazine cover and regular saturday night live sketches.

on one occasion in 2016, ginsburg got herself into trouble and later publicly apologized for disparaging remarks she made about then-presidential candidate trump.

but for the most part ginsburg enjoyed her fame and maintained a sense of humor about herself.

asked about the fact that she had apparently fallen asleep during the 2015 state of the union address, ginsburg did not take the fifth, admitting that although she had vowed not to drink at dinner with the other justices before the speech, the wine had just been too good to resist. the result, she said, was that she was perhaps not an entirely ""sober judge"" and kept nodding off.

the road to law

born in brooklyn, ruth bader went to public schools, where she excelled as a student — and as a baton twirler. by all accounts, it was her mother who was the driving force in her young life, but celia bader died of cancer the day before the future justice would graduate from high school.

then 17, ruth bader went on to cornell university on a full scholarship, where she met martin (aka ""marty"") ginsburg. ""what made marty so overwhelmingly attractive to me was that he cared that i had a brain,"" she said.

after her graduation, they were married and went off to fort sill, okla., for his military service. there mrs. ginsburg, despite scoring high on the civil service exam, could only get a job as a typist, and when she became pregnant, she lost even that job.

two years later, the couple returned to the east coast to attend harvard law school. she was one of only nine women in a class of more than 500 and found the dean asking her why she was taking up a place that ""should go to a man.""

at harvard, she was the academic star, not her husband. the couple were busy juggling schedules and their toddler when marty ginsburg was diagnosed with testicular cancer. surgeries and aggressive radiation followed.

""so that left ruth with a 3-year-old child, a fairly sick husband, the law review, classes to attend and feeding me,"" marty ginsburg said in a 1993 interview with npr.

the experience also taught the future justice that sleep was a luxury. during the year of her husband's illness, he was only able to eat late at night; after that he would dictate his senior class paper to her. at about 2 a.m., he would go back to sleep, ruth bader ginsburg recalled in an npr interview. ""then i'd take out the books and start reading what i needed to be prepared for classes the next day.""

marty ginsburg survived, graduated and got a job in new york; his wife, a year behind him in school, transferred to columbia, where she graduated at the top of her law school class. despite her academic achievements, the doors to law firms were closed to women, and though recommended for a supreme court clerkship, she wasn't even interviewed.

it was bad enough that she was a woman, she recalled later, but she was also a mother, and male judges worried she would be diverted by her ""familial obligations.""

a mentor, law professor gerald gunther, finally got her a clerkship in new york by promising judge edmund palmieri that if she couldn't do the work, he would provide someone who could. that was ""the carrot,"" ginsburg would say later. ""the stick"" was that gunther, who regularly fed his best students to palmieri, told the judge that if he didn't take ginsburg, gunther would never send him a clerk again. the ginsburg clerkship apparently was a success; palmieri kept her not for the usual one year, but two, from 1959-61.

ginsburg's next path is rarely talked about, mainly because it doesn't fit the narrative. she learned swedish so she could work with anders bruzelius, a swedish civil procedure scholar. through the columbia university school of law project on international procedure, ginsburg and bruzelius co-authored a book.

in 1963, ginsburg finally landed a teaching job at rutgers law school, where she at one point hid her second pregnancy by wearing her mother-in-law's clothes. the ruse worked; her contract was renewed before her baby was born.

while at rutgers, she began her work fighting gender discrimination.

the ""mother brief""

her first big case was a challenge to a law that barred a colorado man named charles moritz from taking a tax deduction for the care of his 89-year-old mother. the irs said the deduction, by statute, could only be claimed by women, or widowed or divorced men. but moritz had never married.

the tax court concluded that the internal revenue code was immune to constitutional challenge, a notion that tax lawyer marty ginsburg viewed as ""preposterous."" the two ginsburgs took on the case — he from the tax perspective, she from the constitutional one.

according to marty ginsburg, for his wife, this was the ""mother brief."" she had to think through all the issues and how to fix the inequity. the solution was to ask the court not to invalidate the statute but to apply it equally to both sexes. she won in the lower courts.

""amazingly,"" he recalled in a 1993 npr interview, the government petitioned the u.s. supreme court, stating that the decision ""cast a cloud of unconstitutionality"" over literally hundreds of federal statutes, and it attached a list of those statutes, which it compiled with defense department computers.

those laws, marty ginsburg added, ""were the statutes that my wife then litigated ... to overturn over the next decade.""

in 1971, she would write her first supreme court brief in the case of reed v. reed. ruth bader ginsburg represented sally reed, who thought she should be the executor of her son's estate instead of her ex-husband.

the constitutional issue was whether a state could automatically prefer men over women as executors of estates. the answer from the all-male supreme court: no.

it was the first time the court had struck down a state law because it discriminated based on gender.

and that was just the beginning.

by then ginsburg was earning quite a reputation. she would become the first female tenured professor at columbia law school, and she would found the women's rights project at the american civil liberties union.

as the chief architect of the battle for women's legal rights, ginsburg devised a strategy that was characteristically cautious, precise and single-mindedly aimed at one goal: winning.

knowing that she had to persuade male, establishment-oriented judges, she often picked male plaintiffs, and she liked social security cases because they illustrated how discrimination against women can harm men. for example, in weinberger v. wiesenfeld, she represented a man whose wife, the principal breadwinner, died in childbirth. the husband sought survivor's benefits to care for his child, but under the then-existing social security law, only widows, not widowers, were entitled to such benefits.

""this absolute exclusion, based on gender per se, operates to the disadvantage of female workers, their surviving spouses, and their children,"" ginsburg told the justices at oral argument. the supreme court would ultimately agree, as it did in five of the six cases she argued.

over the years, ginsburg would file dozens of briefs seeking to persuade the courts that the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection applies not just to racial and ethnic minorities but to women as well.

in an interview with npr, she explained the legal theory that she eventually sold to the supreme court.

""the words of the 14th amendment's equal protection clause — 'nor shall any state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.' well that word, 'any person,' covers women as well as men. and the supreme court woke up to that reality in 1971,"" ginsburg said.

during these pioneering years, ginsburg would often work through the night as she had during law school. but by this time, she had two children, and she later liked to tell a story about the lesson she learned when her son, in grade school, seemed to have a proclivity for getting into trouble.

the scrapes were hardly major, and ginsburg grew exasperated by demands from school administrators that she come in to discuss her son's alleged misbehavior. finally, there came a day when she had had enough. ""i had stayed up all night the night before, and i said to the principal, 'this child has two parents. please alternate calls.' ""

after that, she found, the calls were few and far between. it seemed, she said, that most infractions were not worth calling a busy husband about.

in 1980, president jimmy carter named ginsburg to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. over the next 13 years, she would amass a record as something of a centrist liberal, and in 1993, president bill clinton nominated her to the supreme court, the second woman appointed to the position.

she was not first on his list. for months, clinton flirted with other potential nominees, and some women's rights activists withheld their active support because they were worried about ginsburg's views on abortion. she had been publicly critical of the legal reasoning in roe v. wade.

but in the background, marty ginsburg was lobbying hard for his wife. and finally ruth ginsburg was invited for a meeting with the president. as one white house official put it afterward, clinton ""fell for her — hook, line and sinker."" so did the senate. she was confirmed by a 96-3 vote.

once on the court, ginsburg was an example of a woman who defied stereotypes. though she looked tiny and frail, she rode horses well into her 70s and even went parasailing. at home, it was her husband who was the chef, indeed a master chef, while the justice cheerfully acknowledged she was an awful cook.

though a liberal, she and the court's conservative icon, antonin scalia, who died in 2016, were the closest of friends. indeed, an opera called scalia/ginsburg is based on their legal disagreements, and their affection for each other.

over the years, as ginsburg's place on the court grew in seniority, so did her role. in 2006, as the court veered right after the retirement of justice sandra day o'connor, ginsburg dissented more often and more assertively, her most passionate dissents coming in women's rights cases.

dissenting in ledbetter v. goodyear in 2007, she called on congress to pass legislation that would override a court decision that drastically limited back pay available for victims of employment discrimination. the resulting legislation was the first bill passed in 2009 after obama took office.

in 2014, she dissented fiercely in burwell v. hobby lobby, a decision that allowed some for-profit companies to refuse, on religious grounds, to comply with a federal mandate to cover birth control in health care plans. such an exemption, she said, would ""deny legions of women who do not hold their employers' beliefs, access to contraceptive coverage.""

where, she asked, ""is the stopping point?"" suppose it offends an employer's religious belief ""to pay the minimum wage"" or ""to accord women equal pay?""

and in 2013, when the court struck down a key provision of the voting rights act, contending that times had changed and the law was no longer needed, ginsburg dissented. she said that throwing out the provision ""when it has worked and is continuing to work ... is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.""

she viewed her dissents as a chance to persuade a future court.

""some of my favorite opinions are dissenting opinions,"" ginsburg told npr. ""i will not live to see what becomes of them, but i remain hopeful.""

and yet, ginsburg still managed some unexpected victories by winning over one or two of the conservative justices in important cases. in 2015, for example, she authored the court's decision upholding independent redistricting commissions established by voter referenda as a way of removing some of the partisanship in drawing legislative district lines.

ginsburg always kept a backbreaking schedule of public appearances both at home and abroad, even after five bouts with cancer: colon cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer 10 years later, lung cancer in 2018, and then pancreatic cancer again in 2019 and liver lesions in 2020. during that time, she endured chemotherapy, radiation and, in the last years of her life, terrible pain from shingles that never went away completely. all who knew her admired her grit. in 2009, three weeks after major cancer surgery, she surprised everyone when she showed up for the state of the union address.

shortly after that, she was back on the bench; it was her husband, marty, who told her she could do it, even when she thought she could not, she told npr.

a year later her psychological toughness was on full display when her beloved husband of 56 years was mortally ill. as she packed up his things at the hospital before taking him home to die, she found a note he had written to her. ""my dearest ruth,"" it began, ""you are the only person i have ever loved,"" setting aside children and family. ""i have admired and loved you almost since the day we first met at cornell. ... the time has come for me to ... take leave of life because the loss of quality simply overwhelms. i hope you will support where i come out, but i understand you may not. i will not love you a jot less.""

shortly after that, marty ginsburg died at home. the next day, his wife, the justice, was on the bench, reading an important opinion she had authored for the court. she was there, she said, because ""marty would have wanted it.""

years later, she would read the letter aloud in an npr interview, and at the end, choke down the tears.

in the years after marty's death, she would persevere without him, maintaining a jam-packed schedule when she was not on the bench or working on opinions.

some liberals criticized her for not retiring while obama was president, but she was at the top of her game, enjoyed her work enormously and feared that republicans might not confirm a successor. she was an avid consumer of opera, literature and modern art. but in the end, it was her work, she said, that sustained her.

""i do think that i was born under a very bright star,"" she said in an npr interview. ""because if you think about my life, i get out of law school. i have top grades. no law firm in the city of new york will hire me. i end up teaching; it gave me time to devote to the movement for evening out the rights of women and men.""

and it was that legal crusade for women's rights that ultimately led to her appointment to the u.s. supreme court.

to the end of her tenure, she remained a special kind of feminist, both decorous and dogged."
McConnell vows Senate will hold vote on Ginsburg’s replacement,46,ivjfcw,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/18/mcconnell-vows-senate-will-hold-vote-on-ginsburgs-replacement-418021,19,1600509018.0,,"mcconnell’s decision has already outraged democrats, who have called for the majority leader to wait until january — when the control of the white house and the senate could shift — to put a nominee on the floor.

but mcconnell, who blocked former president barack obama from placing merrick garland on the supreme court in 2016, and later changed senate filibuster rules to put two of trump’s picks on the high court, is once again playing power politics of the bare-knuckled kind. his announcement will now force the hand of any wavering republicans. they are either with trump and mcconnell, or they are against them; there will be no middle ground in this fight.

trump, mcconnell and senate judiciary chair lindsey graham (r-s.c.) are all up for reelection on nov. 3. if trump quickly announces a nominee and graham goes ahead with a hearing and vote on the president's choice, democrats can slow down the process. but, with the gop in the majority, they can't stop it.

graham on friday did not immediately address the prospect of a supreme court confirmation fight, only offering condolences to the family of ginsburg, who died at age 87 on friday from complications related to pancreatic cancer.

“it was with great sadness that i learned of the passing of justice ginsburg,” said graham, who faces a reelection battle in november that is shaping up as a battleground.

“justice ginsburg was a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes. she served with honor and distinction as a member of the supreme court,” graham added. “while i had many differences with her on legal philosophy, i appreciate her service to our nation.”

in 2018, graham said in the midst of brett kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing that he would “wait until the next election” if a vacancy were created in the final year of trump’s presidency after the primaries had started. he has since wavered, saying early this year that the ugly confirmation fight over kavanaugh changed his view.

but graham, who faces a surprisingly tough challenge from democrat jaime harrison and is one of the president's closest allies in the senate, is almost certain to go along with mcconnell.

sen. ted cruz (r-texas), a member of the judiciary committee, said friday evening that trump should nominate a replacement as soon as next week.

“we cannot have election day come and go with a 4-4 court ... and i think we risk a constitutional crisis if we do not have a nine-justice supreme court, particularly when there is such a risk of a contested litigation and a contested election,” cruz, who was also on trump’s shortlist of possible supreme court nominees, said on fox news.

to meet that timeline, the senate would have to work at a record pace. the average supreme court confirmation process takes more than two months from start to finish. the senate could also confirm a supreme court nominee before the end of the lame duck session ends in early january.

abortion, gun rights, climate change and the limits of executive power are already at the top of voters’ minds heading into the final weeks of the campaign. ginsburg’s death, and the possibility that trump and mcconnell could solidify conservative control of the high court, will now become a critical focus of the battle for both the senate and the white house in the final stretch of the campaign.

vulnerable gop senators including susan collins of maine, thom tillis of north carolina and cory gardner of colorado will not be able to escape questions over whether they would support filling ginsburg’s seat before election day, or the even more troubling question about what would happen if trump loses reelection and the senate changes hands.

across the aisle, democrats are already lashing out at the looming move by trump and mcconnell, and their protestations are only going to grow louder in coming weeks.

minutes after ginsburg’s death was announced, senate minority leader chuck schumer declared that mcconnell should leave ginsburg’s seat open until next year, setting out the position all senate democrats will adopt.

“the american people should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice,” schumer wrote on twitter, using mcconnell’s own words after the death of justice antonin scalia in 2016. “therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.”

sen. dianne feinstein of california, the top democrat on the judiciary committee, echoed schumer.

“under no circumstances should the senate consider a replacement for justice ginsburg until after the presidential inauguration,” she said in a statement.

democratic presidential nominee joe biden was in lockstep with his party on friday, writing in a statement: “the voters should pick a president, and that president should select a successor to justice ginsburg.”

according to npr, ginsburg dictated to her granddaughter in her final days that her “most fervent wish” was that she not be replaced on the court “until a new president is installed.”

but the vacancy will also put pressure on the handful of senate republicans who have expressed concerns about confirming a supreme court justice close to an election, as well as vulnerable republicans in swing states.

collins told the new york times recently that she would not support seating a supreme court justice in october, citing the proximity to the election. collins praised ginsburg in a statement on friday night but made no mention of her position on the timing of a possible vote on a replacement. collins was one of the deciding votes in kavanaugh’s contentious october 2018 senate confirmation and is trailing in some polls against her democratic opponent, sara gideon.

in an interview friday before ginsburg’s death, sen. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) said she would not want to see a supreme court confirmation vote before the election.

“i would not vote to confirm a supreme court nominee. we are some 50 days away from an election,” murkowski told alaska public radio.

sen. mitt romney (r-utah), who has broken with trump in the past and voted to convict the president during his impeachment trial, on friday said nothing on the timing of the vote but praised ginsburg.

yet that leaves mcconnell with a vote to spare, and vice president mike pence could vote on a nomination in the event of 50-50 tie.

other republican senators were quick to weigh in. sen. martha mcsally (r-ariz.), who is up for reelection this year and is behind her democratic challenger mark kelly in most polls, said friday that “this u.s. senate should vote on president trump's next nominee for the u.s. supreme court.”

the senate was expected to recess later this month after passing a government funding bill, giving lawmakers a month in their home states to campaign for reelection.

the prospect of ginsburg’s passing had already animated a fierce effort by lawmakers and trump to fill a potential supreme court vacancy. trump recently named a list of conservatives, including several sitting gop senators, from which he intends to pick the next justice.

when scalia died in february 2016, mcconnell argued at the time that the choice should be left to voters given that scalia’s death occurred in a presidential election year. but mcconnell has emphasized that when the white house and senate are controlled by the same political party, such restraints should not apply, and he has repeatedly signaled a willingness to move a supreme court nomination even in close proximity to the election.

unlike other recent vacancies, though, a republican nominee is likely to shift the supreme court sharply to the right. trump’s previous two nominees, kavanaugh and neil gorsuch, are among the court’s more conservative members but replaced similarly conservative justices."

Russia's Navalny says he's now more than 'technically alive',108,ivskes,https://apnews.com/fa4de240672653d47a707faee0cd67d9,6,1600551002.0,,"in this photo taken from a video published by russian opposition leader alexei navalny on his instagram account, russian opposition leader alexei navalny walks down stairs in a hospital in berlin, germany, saturday, sept. 19, 2020. navalny, who is being treated in a german hospital for suspected poisoning by a nerve agent, says on social media that he is recovering verbal and physical abilities despite despairing at first.

(navalny instagram via ap)

moscow (ap) — russian opposition leader alexei navalny said he is recovering his verbal and physical abilities at the german hospital where he is being treated for suspected nerve agent poisoning but that he at first felt despair over his condition.

navalny, the most visible opponent of russian president vladimir putin, fell ill on a domestic flight to moscow on aug. 20 and was transferred to germany for treatment two days later. a german military lab later determined that the russian politician was poisoned with novichok, the same class of soviet-era agent that britain said was used on a former russian spy and his daughter in england, in 2018.

navalny was kept in an induced coma for more than a week while being treated with an antidote. he said in a saturday post on instagram that once he was brought out of the coma, he was confused and couldn’t find the words to respond to a doctor’s questions.

“although i understood in general what the doctor wanted, i did not understand where to get the words. in what part of the head do they appear in?” navalny wrote in the post, which accompanied a photo of him on a staircase. “i also did not know how to express my despair and, therefore, simply kept silent.”

“now i’m a guy whose legs are shaking when he walks up the stairs, but he thinks: ‘oh, this is a staircase! they go up it. perhaps we should look for an elevator,’” navalny said. ”and before, i would have just stood there and stared.”

the doctors treating him at berlin’s charite hospital “turned me from a ‘technically alive person’ into someone who has every chance to become the highest form of being in modern society again — a person who can quickly scroll through instagram and without hesitation understands where to put likes,” he wrote.

the kremlin has repeatedly said that before navalny’s transfer to berlin, russian labs and a hospital in the siberian city of omsk found no sign of a poisoning. moscow has called for germany to provide its evidence and bristled at the urging of german chancellor angela merkel and other western leaders to answer questions about what happened to the politician.

“there is too much absurdity in this case to take anyone at their word,” kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said friday.

peskov also accused navalny’s colleagues of hampering a russian investigation by taking items from his hotel room out of the country, including a water bottle they claimed had traces of the nerve agent.

navalny’s colleagues said that they removed the bottle and other items from the hotel room in the siberian city of tomsk siberia and brought them to germany as potential evidence. because they didn’t trust russian authorities to conduct a proper probe."

Ricin Is Said to Have Been Sent to White House,96,ivys3w,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/19/us/politics/ricin-white-house-postal-service.html#click=https://t.co/ZCVPfbbd8t,20,1600571498.0,,"the joint terrorism task force in washington is leading the investigation, with assistance from new york, according to multiple law enforcement officials. so far, investigators have found no links between the ricin letters and any international terrorist groups, but the investigation is in its early stages, and nothing has yet been ruled out, one senior official said.

ricin, which is part of the waste produced when castor oil is made, has no known antidote.

“the f.b.i. and our u.s. secret service and u.s. postal inspection service partners are investigating a suspicious letter received at a u.s. government mail facility,” the f.b.i. said in a statement. “at this time, there is no known threat to public safety.”

officials declined to discuss what evidence they had that pointed them to the suspect. gathering evidence will be a painstaking process. as part of the investigation, for example, agents may need to identify the sorting facility that handled the letters, identify public mailboxes assigned to that sorting facility and see if there is video of the suspect posting the letters in the hours before they were collected by postal workers.

this is not the first time that u.s. officials have been targeted in ricin attacks.

in 2018, william clyde allen, a navy veteran, was charged in a seven-count federal indictment for trying to send envelopes with ricin to defense secretary jim mattis; the chief of naval operations, adm. john m. richardson; the f.b.i. director, christopher a. wray; the c.i.a. director, gina haspel; and the secretary of the air force, heather wilson.

officials determined that mr. allen had sent castor beans, rather than ricin. his case is still pending."
Facebook tells Irish court that probe threatens its EU operations,124,iwdven,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy/facebook-tells-irish-court-that-probe-threatens-its-eu-operations-newspaper-idUSKCN26B0CV,10,1600637401.0,,"file photo: a 3d printed facebook logo is placed between small toy people figures in front of a keyboard in this illustration taken april 12, 2020. reuters/dado ruvic/illustration

dublin (reuters) - facebook has told ireland’s high court it cannot see how its services could operate in the european union if regulators freeze its data transfer mechanism, the sunday business post reported, citing court documents seen by the paper.

the u.s. social media giant last week said that the irish data protection commission, its lead eu regulator, had made a preliminary decision that the mechanism it uses to transfer data from the eu to the united states “cannot in practice be used”.

facebook requested and secured a temporary freeze on the order and a court review in the irish high court, which is due to consider the issue in november.

in an affidavit submitted to the court to request that the order be frozen, yvonne cunnane, facebook ireland’s head of data protection and associate general counsel, said it was not clear how the company could continue providing services in the eu if the irish order is enforced, the sunday business post reported.

“it is not clear to (facebook) how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the facebook and instagram services in the eu,” the newspaper quoted the affidavit as saying.

the affidavit has not been made public, a high court spokesman said, and a facebook spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

in a sept. 9 blog post that first confirmed the investigation by the irish regulator, facebook said it “relied on the mechanism in question - under what are known as standard contractual clauses (sccs) - to transfer data to countries outside the eu and that a ban would have “a far reaching effect on businesses that rely on sccs”.

the irish investigation follows a ruling by the court of justice of the european union in july on when sccs can be used legally.

the ruling was in response to eu concerns that the surveillance regime in the united states might not respect the privacy rights of eu citizens when their personal data is sent to the united states for commercial use."
McConnell Is Inventing Excuses to Grab Ginsburg’s Seat,39,iwh281,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/09/mcconnell-excuses-ginsburg-supreme-court.html,42,1600648357.0,,"four years ago, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell blocked consideration of president barack obama’s supreme court nominee, merrick garland. mcconnell said he was entitled to do this because it was a presidential election year, and the senate should wait for voters to choose the president who would choose the next justice. now that donald trump is president, mcconnell has reversed himself. on friday night, after the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg, mcconnell announced that he would proceed with a vote on trump’s nominee to replace her. it’s a ruthless power grab, and mcconnell is trying to cover it with phony excuses.

mcconnell’s new statement claims that he was justified in blocking garland based on a tradition: “since the 1880s, no senate has confirmed an opposite-party president’s supreme court nominee in a presidential election year.” he’s suggesting that the tradition doesn’t apply when the majority party in the senate faces a nominee put forward by a president of the same party.

but that’s not what mcconnell said four years ago. in a fox news interview on march 20, 2016, he asserted “a long-standing tradition of not filling vacancies on the supreme court in the middle of a presidential election year.” the “principle,” he explained, was that “the american people are choosing their next president, and their next president should pick this supreme court nominee.” the underlying idea was democracy, and that idea applied regardless of the president’s party. in statements throughout the garland episode, mcconnell traced the origins of this tradition not just to the 1880s but to 1932, when the senate had last confirmed a justice nominated by a president of the same party.

republicans on the senate judiciary committee took the same position. “not since 1932 has the senate confirmed in a presidential election year a supreme court nominee to a vacancy arising in that year,” they wrote in a february 2016 letter. “because our decision is based on constitutional principle and born of a necessity to protect the will of the american people, this committee will not hold hearings on any supreme court nominee until after our next president is sworn in.”

mcconnell has to explain why he respects the mandate given to a republican president who lost the popular vote but not the mandate given to a democratic president who won the popular vote.

since 2016, mcconnell has reaffirmed this rule. “the tradition had been not to confirm vacancies created in the middle of a presidential year,” he repeated in 2017. “you don’t fill supreme court vacancies in the middle of a presidential election.” now he’s trying to carve out an exception to the rule, by inserting the phrase “opposite-party.”

he’s also trying to rewrite the time frame in which the rule applies. in 2016, he said it applied “in the final year of a presidential term” or “near the end of a presidential term.” now he says it applies only in “the last days of a lame-duck president’s second term.” this revision, too, is opportunistic and baseless. if the principle is that voters should choose who will make court appointments for the next four years, that principle applies regardless of how long the current president has served.

you could argue that trump already has a mandate from the previous presidential election. but that was also true of obama. so mcconnell has to explain why he respects the mandate given to a republican president who lost the popular vote but not the mandate given to a democratic president who won the popular vote.

mcconnell’s answer is that voters, in the intervening midterms, reaffirmed trump’s mandate but revoked obama’s. his statement claims that in 2014, voters elected a republican senate majority “to check and balance” obama. “by contrast, americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with president trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary.”

the mandate argument reverses the election-year argument. it says that instead of waiting to hear from voters in the current election, you should proceed with what they told you in the last election. but let’s set that flaming contradiction aside. the more basic problem is that mcconnell’s description of the gop’s current mandate isn’t true.

when voters “reelected [the republican] majority in 2016,” as mcconnell puts it, what they actually did was cut that majority from 54 seats to 52. in exit polls, they expressed a more favorable view of the democratic party (47 percent favorable) than of the republican party (40 percent favorable). in 2018, voters elected democrats and two democratic-affiliated independents (bernie sanders and angus king) to 24 of the 35 senate seats on the ballot. the only reason the gop kept its majority was that 42 of its 51 seats weren’t up for reelection.

when mcconnell blocked garland in 2016, he said voters had “issued a stinging rebuke to this president and his policies in our latest national election, delivering a landslide for the opposition party as they handed control of the senate to republicans.” that’s almost exactly what happened to trump in 2018. voters couldn’t flip the senate—too many republican senators weren’t on the ballot—so they flipped the house. they delivered a 40-seat landslide, handing control of the house to democrats. in exit polls, most voters disapproved of trump, and 46 percent strongly disapproved of him. two-thirds said the supreme court should preserve roe v. wade, and a plurality opposed brett kavanaugh, trump’s most recent appointee to the court.

the 2018 election also addressed another point mcconnell made in 2016. he said he was entitled to block garland because “the senate has not filled a vacancy arising in an election year when there was divided government since 1888.” we now have divided government. voters elected a democratic house, and according to polls, they’re likely to elect a democratic president and a democratic senate.

trump and his party could win the election and claim a mandate. but it’s not true that republicans kept their senate majority in 2016 and 2018 because they “pledged to work with president trump and support his agenda.” voters rejected trump’s agenda, including his judicial agenda. they rebuked him in every way they could. and in a poll conducted on saturday, a majority of voters said trump shouldn’t appoint a new justice to replace ginsburg. a plurality, 49 percent to 40 percent, said joe biden would do a better job of selecting a justice than trump would.

mcconnell doesn’t want to hear any of this. he doesn’t want to wait for the judgment of the electorate, as he did in 2016. so he’s rewriting history and coming up with excuses. all that stuff about the will of the people has been replaced by caveats like “opposite-party” and “second term,” along with a whitewash of 2018. don’t believe a word of it. he just wants the seat."
"FinCEN Files Show Criminals Moved Billions As Banks, Governments Watched",169,iwmawa,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fincen-files-financial-scandal-criminal-networks,18,1600664906.0,,"thousands of secret “suspicious activity reports” offer a never-before-seen picture of corruption and complicity — and how the government lets it flourish.

a huge trove of secret government documents reveals for the first time how the giants of western banking move trillions of dollars in suspicious transactions, enriching themselves and their shareholders while facilitating the work of terrorists, kleptocrats, and drug kingpins.

and the us government, despite its vast powers, fails to stop it.



today, the fincen files — thousands of “suspicious activity reports” and other us government documents — offer an unprecedented view of global financial corruption, the banks enabling it, and the government agencies that watch as it flourishes. buzzfeed news has shared these reports with the international consortium of investigative journalists and more than 100 news organizations in 88 countries. these documents, compiled by banks, shared with the government, but kept from public view, expose the hollowness of banking safeguards, and the ease with which criminals have exploited them. profits from deadly drug wars, fortunes embezzled from developing countries, and hard-earned savings stolen in a ponzi scheme were all allowed to flow into and out of these financial institutions, despite warnings from the banks’ own employees. money laundering is a crime that makes other crimes possible. it can accelerate economic inequality, drain public funds, undermine democracy, and destabilize nations — and the banks play a key role. “some of these people in those crisp white shirts in their sharp suits are feeding off the tragedy of people dying all over the world,” said martin woods, a former suspicious transactions investigator for wachovia.

laws that were meant to stop financial crime have instead allowed it to flourish. so long as a bank files a notice that it may be facilitating criminal activity, it all but immunizes itself and its executives from criminal prosecution. the suspicious activity alert effectively gives them a free pass to keep moving the money and collecting the fees. the financial crimes enforcement network, or fincen, is the agency within the treasury department charged with combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. it collects millions of these suspicious activity reports, known as sars. it makes them available to us law enforcement agencies and other nations’ financial intelligence operations. it even compiles a report called “kleptocracy weekly” that summarizes the dealings of foreign leaders such as russian president vladimir putin. what it does not do is force the banks to shut the money laundering down. in the rare instances when the us government does crack down on banks, it often relies on sweetheart deals called deferred prosecution agreements, which include fines but no high-level arrests. the trump administration has made it even harder to hold executives personally accountable, under guidance by former deputy attorney general rod rosenstein that warned government agencies against “piling on.” rosenstein did not respond to requests for comment, but after this article was published, he wrote to say that his policies sought to “encourage prosecutors to pursue charges against the people responsible for corporate wrongdoing.” the fincen files investigation shows that even after they were prosecuted or fined for financial misconduct, banks such as jpmorgan chase, hsbc, standard chartered, deutsche bank, and bank of new york mellon continued to move money for suspected criminals. suspicious payments flow around the world and into countless industries, from international sports to hollywood entertainment to luxury real estate to nobu sushi restaurants. they filter into the companies that make familiar items from people’s lives, from the gas in their car to the granola in their cereal bowl. the fincen files expose an underlying truth of the modern era: the networks through which dirty money traverse the world have become vital arteries of the global economy. they enable a shadow financial system so wide-ranging and so unchecked that it has become inextricable from the so-called legitimate economy. banks with household names have helped to make it so.

buzzfeed news’ investigation shows that: standard chartered moved money on behalf of al zarooni exchange, a dubai-based business that was later accused of laundering cash on behalf of the taliban. during the years that al zarooni was a standard chartered customer, taliban militants staged violent attacks that killed civilians and soldiers. hsbc’s hong kong branch allowed wcm777, a ponzi scheme, to move more than $15 million even as the business was being barred from operating in three states. authorities say the scam stole at least $80 million from investors, mainly latino and asian immigrants, and the company’s owner used the looted funds to buy two golf courses, a 7,000-square-foot mansion, a 39.8-carat diamond, and mining rights in sierra leone. bank of america, citibank, jpmorgan chase, american express, and others collectively processed millions of dollars in transactions for the family of viktor khrapunov, the former mayor of kazakhstan’s most populous city, even after interpol issued a red notice for his arrest. khrapunov, who had already fled to switzerland and who claims the allegations are politically motivated, was later convicted in absentia on charges that included bribe-taking and defrauding the city through the sale of public property. the banks mentioned in this story said they could not comment on specific transactions due to bank secrecy laws. their statements can be found here. by law, banks must file suspicious activity reports when they spot transactions that bear the hallmarks of money laundering or other financial misconduct, such as large, round-number transactions or payments between companies with no discernible business relationship. sars are not by themselves evidence of a crime, but fincen’s director, kenneth blanco, has called them “vital for law enforcement investigations.”

prior to this reporting, very few sars had ever been revealed. the fincen files encompass more than 2,100.

information from millions of these documents feeds into a single database, through which law enforcement officers can summon detailed financial information with a few keystrokes. the fincen files opens a rare window into this vast system of financial intelligence, unmatched in the world but all but unknown to the public. the sars themselves are so closely held that members of the public cannot obtain them through records requests or subpoenas, and banks are not allowed even to confirm their existence. prior to this reporting, very few sars had ever been revealed. the fincen files encompass more than 2,100. for more than a year, buzzfeed news and its partner news organizations across the world mined the information on these tens of thousands of pages to map more than 200,000 transactions. (here’s an explanation of how we did it.) in all, suspicious activity reports in the fincen files flagged more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017. western banks could have blocked almost any of them, but in most cases they kept the money moving and kept collecting their fees. suspicious activity reports are written by the banks’ financial crime watchdogs, or compliance officers, who are often parked in remote offices and left to make sense of a vast number of transactions with very few resources, writing sars with little research or verification. buzzfeed news’ research went much further, including reams of internal bank data, thousands of pages of public records, hundreds of interviews with sources across the globe, dozens of freedom of information act filings, five public records lawsuits, and requests for three federal courts to unseal records — all to piece together the intricacies of a financial system that is largely hidden.

buzzfeed news is not publishing the sars in full because they contain information about people or companies that are not under suspicion, but who were swept up in the banks’ searches. a subset of the documents is being published, with redactions, to support reporting in specific stories. after the treasury department received detailed questions about the fincen files investigation, the agency released a statement saying that it was “aware that various media outlets intend to publish a series of articles based on unlawfully disclosed suspicious activity reports (sars).” it continued, “the unauthorized disclosure of sars is a crime that can impact the national security of the united states, compromise law enforcement investigations, and threaten the safety and security of the institutions and individuals who file such reports.” the agency announced that it was referring the matter to the department of justice and the treasury department’s office of inspector general. in a subsequent letter, fincen’s general counsel said that disclosure of sars can make banks less willing to file them, which “could mean law enforcement has fewer potential leads to stop crimes like human trafficking, child exploitation, fraud, corruption, terrorism, and cyber-enabled crime.” fincen did not respond to repeated invitations to discuss security concerns. sen. ron wyden, a member of the senate intelligence committee, which requested some of these sars, said the fincen files investigation “reinforces the fact that we now have two systems of law enforcement and justice in the country.” drug cartels move millions through us banks; poor people go to jail for possession. “if you're wealthy and well-connected, you can figure out how to do an enormous amount of harm to society at large and ensure that it accrues to enormous financial benefit for all of you.” robert mazur, a former federal special agent and an expert in money laundering, said that making this material public ""could enhance national security, aid future investigations, and encourage institutions to more consistently adhere to sar filing requirements,” and ""will hopefully get people who are in a position of power to correct an apparent systemic failure.”

a historic opportunity alex fradkin / redux for buzzfeed news the united states treasury department in washington, dc

based in the united arab emirates, mazaka general trading presented itself to the world as a wholesaler. but between march 2013 and april 2014, the company received nearly $50 million from five companies involved in a russian money laundering ring that manipulated international stock trades. in may and june 2014, it received more than $4 million from a singapore company that appears barely even to exist. it was also sending and receiving money from british firms located at 175 darkes lane, one of the world's most notorious addresses for shell companies, which are a common tool to hide ownership. these transactions by mazaka general trading — which the treasury department later declared to be a part of the khanani money laundering network, a group that has financed terrorism and drug cartels around the globe — involved businesses and people far from the shores of the united states. but as the money pinged around from one bank to another, it was all being tracked and it would all be reported to the treasury department. because the us dollar is the lifeblood of international finance, the common denominator between the world’s disparate currencies, banking customers around the world need access to it. but only select banks are licensed to conduct dollar transactions. so smaller banks in other countries partner with larger institutions, which exchange their customers’ pesos, yuan, or dirham for greenbacks. for a fee, the arrangement, known as correspondent banking, helps keep the global economy humming. as they pass through us banks, these transfers give the treasury department a vantage that no other country has. it shares some of that information through the egmont group, a little-known coalition of financial intelligence units from more than 150 countries and territories. sars have provided egmont members with financial details that would be otherwise unattainable, such as those concerning former olympic committee member lamine diack, who has been sentenced to prison for crimes connected to the russian doping scandal, and the russian oligarch oleg deripaska, who was sanctioned by the us two years ago. (deripaska has sued the us government, maintaining that he is an innocent victim of politics.) but if the database is a powerful asset to law enforcement investigations, to privacy advocates, it is a nightmare of overreach. congress created the current sar program in 1992 making banks the frontline in the fight against money laundering. but michael german, a former fbi special agent who is a national security and privacy expert, said that after 9/11, ""the sar program became more about mass surveillance than identifying discrete transactions to disrupt money launderers.” today, he said, ""the data is used like the data from other mass surveillance programs. find someone you want to get for whatever reason then sift through the vast troves of data collected to find anything you can hang them with."" in 2017, when us congressional committees began investigating the last presidential election and other matters, they, too, turned to the treasury department database. they requested sars on deutsche bank, which had loaned trump money; christopher steele, the former mi6 agent who wrote the so-called trump dossier; an array of russian oligarchs; trump’s former campaign chairperson paul manafort; and even a small casino in the pacific run by a former trump employee. all told, they were looking for information on more than 200 entities.

the world’s biggest banks did business with clients they suspected were corrupt.

fincen unearthed tens of thousands of pages of documents. those documents, along with a few additional sars requested by federal law enforcement authorities, make up the majority of the fincen files. some were never turned over to the committees that requested them. a person familiar with the matter blew the whistle to multiple members of congress.

the collection does not include any sars about trump’s finances. (a source familiar with the matter told buzzfeed news that fincen’s database did not contain sars on either trump or the trump organization.) and though the documents show suspicious payments to people in trump’s orbit before and after key moments in the 2016 presidential campaign, they do not provide direct information on any election interference.

because the searches were so broad, however, they revealed something that most in congress hadn’t even been looking for: evidence that the world’s biggest banks kept doing business with clients that they themselves suspected were facilitating terror and corruption. the information was laid out in transaction by transaction. and it had been there all along.

another chance. and then another. alex fradkin / redux for buzzfeed news the fincen headquarters in vienna, virginia

fincen received more than 2 million sars last year. that number has nearly doubled over the past decade, as financial institutions have faced mounting pressure to file and the volume of international transactions has grown. over the same period, fincen’s staff has shrunk by more than 10%. sources there say most sars are never even read, let alone acted upon. meanwhile, experts say, some banks treat sars as a kind of get-out-of-jail-free card, filing alerts about a huge array of transactions without actually moving to halt them. in some cases, banks filed numerous reports on the same clients, detailing their suspected crimes over the course of years while continuing to welcome their business. by december 2013, jpmorgan chase had filed at least eight sars on accounts and companies controlled by manafort, flagging more than $10 million, according to a fincen research report. manafort, who went on to become trump’s campaign chair, was convicted of bank and tax fraud in 2018.

some banks treat sars as a kind of get-out-of-jail-free card, filing alerts about a huge array of transactions without actually moving to halt them.

paul pelletier, a former senior justice department lawyer who once led the agency’s fraud unit, said that approach makes a mockery of the system. “you can't just file sar after sar after sar without eventually violating the money laundering laws,” he said. “you cut them off and drop them as clients. but you don't keep taking their money."" despite the banks’ sweeping powers to investigate account holders, the fincen files investigation reveals that major financial institutions often fail to perform the most basic checks on their customers, such as verifying where a business is located when someone opens a new account. the lapses allow criminal groups to hide behind shell corporations, registered with no identifying details about their ownership, and slide the proceeds of their crimes into the global financial system. in many cases, the banks appear to have no idea whatsoever whose money they are moving. when investigators for hsbc’s american operations asked their colleagues in hong kong for the name of the person who owned trade leader, a company that had moved more than half a billion dollars through the bank in less than two years, the answer they got was “none available.” the company would reportedly emerge as an important hub in the so-called russian laundromat, a sprawling scheme in which wealthy russians, facilitated by banks, secretly moved their money into the west. after scandals like the russian laundromat, federal prosecutors have made big pronouncements about forcing meaningful change. addressing an anti–money laundering conference in 2015, leslie caldwell, then the head of the justice department's criminal division, said that when it came to getting banks to clean up their acts, deferred prosecution agreements, which typically involve a fine and a probationary period, “can often accomplish as much as, and sometimes even more than, we could from a criminal conviction.”

but the fincen files investigation shows something very different. banks often get to the end of their agreement without actually fixing the problems. then, instead of getting the prosecution that they had been threatened with, they just get another chance. and sometimes another. in 2012, hsbc faced a historic crisis. after permitting narcotraffickers to launder money and conducting business in off-limits countries such as sudan and myanmar, the bank was fined $1.9 billion. it promised to change its ways, and to hold it to that promise, the government installed an independent monitor to keep close watch. but the fincen files investigation shows hsbc continued banking, and profiting from, the same kinds of customers that got it in trouble in the first place, such as a panamanian import-export firm that the treasury department later said was laundering money for drug kingpins. jpmorgan chase got a deferred prosecution deal of its own. for years, it was the primary bank of the world’s biggest ponzi schemer, bernie madoff. despite multiple warnings from its own employees, the bank never filed a suspicious activity report on him and allegedly collected $500 million in fees. for punishment, the bank was required to pay a $1.7 billion fine and promise to improve its money laundering defenses. but after it settled the madoff case, the bank’s own investigators said they suspected it had opened its accounts to an alleged russian organized crime figure who is known for drug trafficking and contract murders, as well as businesses tied to the repressive north korean regime, which the us has placed off-limits. it happened at standard chartered, too. last year, the government amended its 2012 deferred prosecution agreement after the bank was found to have continued clearing transactions for individuals and businesses in off-limits countries, primarily iran. the bank paid fines totaling $1.1 billion to us and uk authorities, and extended the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement for the sixth time in the space of seven years. the bank apologized for its “violations and control deficiencies” but promised that none had occurred after 2014. the fincen files documents show standard chartered processed hundreds of millions of dollars for companies it suspected were circumventing sanctions against iran until at least 2017. since 2010, at least 18 financial institutions have received deferred prosecution agreements for anti–money laundering or sanctions violations, according to an analysis by buzzfeed news. of those, at least four went on to break the law again and get fined. twice, the government responded to this kind of repeat offense by renewing the deferred prosecution agreement — the very tool that failed the first time.



can it be fixed? alex fradkin / redux for buzzfeed news the bank of america tower in new york city

if the government wanted to, experts in financial crime say, it could stop the dirty money coursing through the big banks, as well as the vast array of criminal activity it funds. one step would be to require companies to disclose their owners to the treasury department, rather than allowing people to hide behind a shell company. lawmakers are debating a bipartisan bill that could address that for small companies. the national federation of independent business has opposed it, saying it raises privacy issues and would increase costs. sen. sherrod brown, who cosponsored the bill, told buzzfeed news, “congress must act soon because criminals have long been revising, adjusting, and amending their tactics to circumvent our laws.” greater public accountability could also make a difference. hsbc has fought to keep secret the final report by the monitor that the government installed to watch over the bank during the years of its deferred prosecution agreement. it even took the unusual step of weighing in on a freedom of information act lawsuit, when buzzfeed news sued the justice department to release the report. the knowledge that negative reports could become public, and potentially damage share prices, could impel wayward banks to clean up their acts.

“the bankers will never learn until you start putting silver bracelets on people.”

others say the sars themselves are part of the problem. german, the former fbi special agent, called the idea behind them ""naive"" because ""the largest money laundering operations occur with the cooperation of the financial institutions, or at least some officers within those institutions. the lack of money laundering enforcement had nothing to do with a lack of evidence of suspicious transactions, but a lack of interest by political and law enforcement leadership.’’ the most powerful way to fix the problem might be the simplest: arrest the executives whose banks break the law. ""the bankers will never learn until you start putting silver bracelets on people,"" pelletier said. ""think of the message you're sending to repeat offenders."" ""these guys know what they're doing,’’ said thomas nollner, a former regulator with the office of the comptroller of the currency. “you break the law, you should go to jail, period."" that approach was once the norm. “back in the 1980s and 90s and even into the early 2000s, the government went after ceos all the time,” said us district judge jed rakoff, who has been an outspoken critic of weak penalties for white-collar criminals. in the past, the ceos of enron, worldcom, and tyco were all sent to jail for what they did, he pointed out. “now that’s deterrence.” rakoff went further: “under us law, a bank that engages in money laundering can literally be forced out of business by the government, and it is kind of surprising that government hasn’t taken that step, given the obvious deterrent effect it would have.” ultimately, the power to keep criminal profits from being laundered through the us financial system may not reside in the actions of a bank’s compliance office or its computer systems or even its executive tier. it may not reside with banking regulators or federal prosecutors or fincen. it may not even be a matter of national policy alone. shutting down wayward banks could have an impact on the whole economy — for the us, its major trade partners, and beyond. when other countries find their banks under us scrutiny, they step in. in 2012, standard chartered and hsbc were facing criminal prosecution. george osborne, at that time the uk’s chancellor of the exchequer, wrote to the chairperson of the us federal reserve, ben bernanke, and treasury secretary timothy geithner to discuss his “concerns” that a heavy-handed response could have “unintended consequences.” he warned of a “contagion.” the implication: close one bank and the whole economy could suffer. prosecutors stood down. mazur, the former federal special agent and money laundering expert, says there are a “mosaic” of reasons why us authorities let the money keep running, but one of them may just be that it finds its way into too many pockets. “even if it's bad wealth, it buys buildings,” he said. “it puts money into bank accounts. it enriches the nation.” ●

The Age of Electric Cars Is Dawning Ahead of Schedule,84,iwohni,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/20/business/electric-cars-batteries-tesla-elon-musk.html?referringSource=articleShare,10,1600672033.0,,"frankfurt — an electric volkswagen id.3 for the same price as a golf. a tesla model 3 that costs as much as a bmw 3 series. a renault zoe electric subcompact whose monthly lease payment might equal a nice dinner for two in paris.

as car sales collapsed in europe because of the pandemic, one category grew rapidly: electric vehicles. one reason is that purchase prices in europe are coming tantalizingly close to the prices for cars with gasoline or diesel engines.

at the moment this near parity is possible only with government subsidies that, depending on the country, can cut more than $10,000 from the final price. carmakers are offering deals on electric cars to meet stricter european union regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. in germany, an electric renault zoe can be leased for 139 euros a month, or $164.

electric vehicles are not yet as popular in the united states, largely because government incentives are less generous. battery-powered cars account for about 2 percent of new car sales in america, while in europe the market share is approaching 5 percent. including hybrids, the share rises to nearly 9 percent in europe, according to matthias schmidt, an independent analyst in berlin."
"Pennsylvania Supreme Court Extends Vote By Mail Deadline, Allows Drop Boxes",264,iwse12,https://www.npr.org/2020/09/17/914160122/pennsylvania-supreme-court-extends-vote-by-mail-deadline-allows-drop-boxes,32,1600686566.0,,"pennsylvania supreme court extends vote by mail deadline, allows drop boxes

the pennsylvania supreme court handed down several voting-related decisions thursday that are likely to help democrats this fall.

the court extended the deadline for accepting mail ballots, will allow voters to submit their ballots through drop boxes, and removed the green party's candidate for president from the ballot.

the decisions come less than two months before election day and as a flurry of election-related lawsuits continue to pile up around the country.

in dozens of cases, parties, campaigns and other groups are trying to sort questions about voting that have cropped up because of the pandemic. courts are being asked to clarify murky areas of election law that will be exacerbated by the millions more mail ballots that will be cast this year. the questions include whether a ballot must be received by or postmarked by election day, must there be a witness for a mail-in ballot, what standards are being used to judge a voter's signature and whether drop boxes can be used to return ballots instead of relying on the postal service.

2020 is the first year pennsylvanians have the option to vote by mail without needing to specify a reason. the pennsylvania department of state says nearly 2 million people have already asked for mail ballots for the upcoming election — and that figure is expected to grow.

""this is a victory that will help ensure that every eligible voter will more easily be able to cast their ballot and have it counted fairly,"" gov. tom wolf, a democrat, wrote in a statement on thursday.

mail ballots will now be accepted if they are received by 5 p.m. on the friday after the election and were either postmarked by nov. 3 or there is no evidence to suggest they were sent after election day. previously, mail ballots had to be received by 8 p.m. on election day.

during the state's june primary, tens of thousands of ballots arrived after the cutoff due to postal service delays and election officials scrambling to manage the deluge of mail ballots because of the pandemic. the pennsylvania democratic party and the state's democratic secretary of state filed suit to extend the deadline.

""while [the timeline] may be feasible under normal conditions, it will unquestionably fail under the strain of covid-19 and the 2020 presidential election, resulting in the disenfranchisement of voters,"" justice max baer, a democrat, wrote for the majority.

though the decision will enfranchise more voters — it will also mean that a final vote tally will take longer to certify. under current pennsylvania law, clerks cannot begin counting mail ballots until election day.

more democrats are expected to vote by mail than republicans, in part because president trump for months has seeded doubts, without any evidence, about the integrity of mail ballots.

the ruling to give the legal green light to drop boxes is another win for the democrats. the trump campaign filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop their use — but that case was paused while state courts weighed in.

the court's decision to prevent the green party candidate, howie hawkins, from appearing on the ballot, could also help democratic nominee joe biden. in 2016, president trump won pennsylvania by 44,000 votes. green party candidate jill stein received nearly 50,000 votes. earlier this week, wisconsin's supreme court also ruled that hawkins will not be on the state's ballot this fall.

in other rulings thursday, the pennsylvania supreme court also upheld a state law that poll watchers must be registered to vote in the county where they're observing the polls.

and in a win for republicans, the court blocked people from delivering other voters' absentee ballots — a practice democrats call ""community collection"" and republicans deem ""ballot harvesting.""

on the heels of the decisions, republicans in the state legislature wrote in a statement that they are exploring legal and legislative options to circumvent the rulings.

""today's decision makes pennsylvania's elections less secure and opens the door to serious questions about the integrity of the process in one of the most significant national and state elections in recent memory,"" speaker of the house bryan cutler and majority leader kerry benninghoff wrote.

there have already been an estimated 248 pandemic-related election lawsuits this year, and with the election ticking closer, more litigation is likely ahead."

updated monday at 7:41 p.m. et

weeks before the trump administration announced it was cutting the 2020 census schedule short, career officials at the census bureau attempted to send signal flares about how that last-minute decision would lead to ""fatal"" data problems with the national head count and the perception of ""politically-manipulated results.""

internal emails and memos, which were released this weekend as part of a federal lawsuit in california, show career officials trying to hold the integrity of the once-a-decade count together in the last weeks of july amid mounting pressure from the administration to abandon the extended timeline it had previously approved in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

shortening that schedule, a draft document dated july 23 warned, ""will result in a census that has fatal data quality flaws that are unacceptable for a constitutionally-mandated national activity.""

with counting now set to end on sept. 30, the revelations come shortly before federal courts are expected to decide whether to order the administration to keep tallying the country's residents through oct. 31.

the administration says it is under pressure to meet the current legal deadline of dec. 31 for reporting to the president those state population totals that are used to reapportion congressional seats among the states. justice department attorneys say the scheduling problem is for congress to fix, and so far, while some lawmakers have introduced bills, they have not yet passed any new laws.

a hearing before u.s. district judge lucy koh in northern california is scheduled to take place on tuesday, the day after another hearing for a similar lawsuit based in maryland was held monday.

last week, the bureau's census scientific advisory committee unanimously recommended the timeline be extended as the bureau requested to ""ensure a successful completion"" in a way that's based on ""scientific and methodological expertise.""

""when the weather isn't right, we postpone the launching of rockets into space,"" the group of outside experts wrote in their recommendations for the bureau. ""the same should be true of the decennial enumeration, the results of which will impact apportionment, redistricting, funding decisions, legal mandates and regulatory uses of decennial census data over the next decade.""

on monday, the inspector general's office at the commerce department, which oversees the bureau, released a report warning of the risks to the accuracy and completeness of the count from speeding up the census schedule.

the inspector general's inquiry, which was prompted in part by npr's reporting, also concluded that the decision to shorten the timeline was not made by bureau officials, who said they did not know who ultimately made that call. the inquiry has now expanded to include an interview request for deputy commerce secretary karen dunn kelley.



bureau officials say they felt pressure by mid-july from the commerce department to hasten census field operations, according to the inspector general's report. two officials told the internal watchdog group they think the now-blocked memorandum president trump issued on july 21 played a role in the shift of the administration's position on whether census deadlines should be extended.

that memo called for unauthorized immigrants to be excluded from the apportionment count, despite the 14th amendment's requirement to include the ""whole number of persons in each state.""

in the california-based lawsuit, a coalition led by the national urban league contends the administration's abrupt decision to end counting early was made arbitrarily in the wake of trump's memo. the move, the challengers argue, goes against the constitutional mandate to count every person living in the u.s.

in april, commerce secretary wilbur ross — who oversees the bureau and ultimately directed the agency to truncate the census schedule — asked congress to push back the census deadlines to ""ensure the completeness and accuracy"" of this year's count while the bureau tried to work around the disruptions brought on by covid-19.

according to an email released this weekend, the administration dropped that push by july 20, when the bureau's public position had become so uncertain that its chief financial officer, ben page, was not sure how to answer questions from leaders in congress about whether the agency still needed the reporting deadlines changed.

days earlier, bureau officials scrambled to prepare for a july 17 phone call with ross. they enlisted kathleen styles, chief of 2020 census communications and stakeholder relations at the bureau, for help with explaining the time the bureau needs to run quality checks on all of the information it's collected this year for the census.

styles and page, who are both career officials, eventually circulated separate draft documents with other bureau officials that tried to put plainly, as styles wrote in an email, ""why we need every minute of the requested schedule extension.""

""while it may be tempting to think that quality reviews can be shortened, through decades of experience the census bureau has learned that quality reviews are essential to producing data products that do not need to be recalled, products that stand the test of time,"" said the july 21 version of the ""elevator speech"" document styles first drafted.

the document also flagged the danger of ""great skepticism"" about the results of the count if the administration were to shorten the schedule after bureau officials had repeatedly emphasized in public the need for more time.

""census results have always been about confidence - our nation uses census data because people and politicians have confidence in the census bureau's ability to produce high quality, impartial data, free from political interference,"" the document said. ""in this sense being seen to produce politically-manipulated results is as much of a danger as low quality data.""

career bureau officials tried to prepare steven dillingham, a trump appointee who is the bureau's current director, to convey the need for deadline extensions to lawmakers during a hearing before the house oversight and reform committee on july 29.

a slide deck for dillingham's briefing book noted that even though the bureau's methodology for processing census results has been ""upgraded with improved current technology,"" it will not allow the bureau to ""meet the statutory deadlines based on projected current field completion dates.""

during the capitol hill hearing, however, dillingham ultimately did not answer multiple questions about whether he supports the bureau's original request to extend the census deadlines. instead, dillingham told lawmakers that ""the census bureau and others really want us to proceed as rapidly as possible.""

on the same day of the hearing, ross directed the bureau to come up with a plan to ""accelerate"" census operations and present it to him on aug. 3, al fontenot, the associate director for the 2020 census, revealed this month in a court filing.

npr confirmed the following day, july 30, that the bureau had decided to speed up door-knocking efforts in order to finish by sept. 30, a month earlier than planned.

meanwhile, despite their recommendations against shortening a census timeline, based on orders from ross, fontenot instructed other career officials at the bureau on july 30 to flesh out plans for doing just that.

in emails the next day, fontenot praised the teams who ""sweated and toiled,"" and michael thieme, an assistant director in charge of systems and contracts for the count, noted the ""great work under high pressure.""

""now i just wish it were for a more positive situation than what we're facing,"" thieme added."

u.s. president donald trump rallied supporters in minnesota over the weekend with a promise to prosecute local congresswoman ilhan omar, while offering praise for the “good genes” of his supporters in the state.

“you have good genes, you know that, right? you have good genes. a lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don't you believe? the racehorse theory. you think we’re so different? you have good genes in minnesota.”

the “racehorse theory” is the idea that some human beings are born genetically superior to others. halie soifer, the executive director of the jewish democratic council of america, slammed trump’s comments, saying, “again, trump speaks about having ""good genes."" he mentioned the ""racehorse theory"" and coupled it with a racist rant against refugees.""

soifer continued, ""this is eugenics. it was used by nazis to justify genocide. today, it's used by white nationalists - & apparently the @potus - to justify hate.”

cnn anchor jake tapper responded with the comment, “who has bad genes, mr. president?”

author and historian steve silberman added: “as a historian who has written about the holocaust, i'll say bluntly: this is indistinguishable from the nazi rhetoric that led to jews, disabled people, lgbtq, romani and others being exterminated. this is america 2020. this is where the gop has taken us.”

during the rally trump also claimed that minnesota would be flooded with refugees if democrat joe biden won the white house. he lashed out at liberal reps. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., and ilhan omar, d-minn. he also talked big ten football.

toward the end, he told the crowd that the winner of the nov. 3 election would be certain to have the chance to pick one or more justices, seemingly unaware of the death of ruth bader ginsburg.

at one point, a trump supporter alerted those around him that he had just received a news alert on his phone that ginsburg had died. “really?” responded a man wearing a camouflage trump hat. those nearby briefly turned their gaze away from the president’s speech and to the man with the iphone.

a few minutes later, trump would turn his own attention to the high court, something he frequently does during his speeches, to talk about remaking the judiciary with his appointment of more than 200 federal judges and two justices, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh. as trump told the audience that the winner of the november election might have the chance to appoint multiple justices, one man shouted at the president, “one more, one more!”

trump reminded the audience that earlier this month he had released an updated list of conservatives who would be under consideration for a lifetime appointment to the supreme court should he be given the opportunity.

he noted that among those on his list was sen. ted cruz, the texas republican he vanquished in the battle for the gop presidential nomination in 2016.

trump joked that cruz would get the backing of every republican and democrat, because they’d be happy to be rid of texas’ junior senator, implying that his personality has rubbed some of his colleagues the wrong way.

as trump moved on to other topics, white house aides were reacting to ginsberg’s death.

white house adviser ben williamson took to twitter to say the white house flag had been lowered to half-staff to honor ginsburg. white house chief of staff mark meadows tweeted his condolences to the late justice’s family and loved ones.

trump didn’t speak with the white house reporters traveling on air force one during his return trip to washington, as he frequently does during his travels. but shortly before landing, he issued a statement praising ginsburg for her “brilliant mind and her powerful dissents” and her ability to “disagree without being disagreeable.”

“may her memory be a great and magnificent blessing to the world,” trump said, speaking with unusual respect for a political foe.

biden’s plane landed at new castle airport in delaware moments after his press plane had arrived. aides scurried to set up a place for biden to make a statement away from the noise of the aircraft’s engines.

“you all learned, as i did on this flight, very sad news,” he said.

“let me be clear, voters should pick the president, the president should pick the justice for the senate to consider,” biden said.

he concluded, “thank you all and i’m sorry such a ... .” he paused but didn’t finish the sentence, simply adding, “you had to learn it on a plane ride.”"
Humans Wiped Out Two-Thirds of the World’s Wildlife in 50 Years,15,ix409e,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/humans-wiped-out-two-thirds-worlds-wildlife-50-years-180975824/,5,1600735259.0,,"two major reports released this month paint a grim portrait of the future for our planet’s wildlife. first, the living planet report from the world wildlife fund (wwf), published last week, found that in half a century, human activity has decimated global wildlife populations by an average of 68 percent.

the study analyzed population sizes of 4,392 monitored species of mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians from 1970 to 2016, reports karin brulliard for the washington post. it found that populations in latin america and the caribbean fared the worst, with a staggering 94 percent decline in population. all told, the drastic species decline tracked in this study “signal a fundamentally broken relationship between humans and the natural world,” the wwf notes in a release.

the wwf report singles out habitat destruction caused by humans as the main threat to the world’s biodiversity. for example, freshwater mammal, bird, amphibian and reptile populations have declined by an average of four percent each year since 1970.

“you begin to see a picture of an unraveling of nature. that is alarming—and i think alarming, even by our own measures of alarming,” wwf chief scientist rebecca shaw tells cnn’s amy woodyatt. “… [w]e’re seeing very distinct declines in freshwater ecosystems, largely because of the way we dam rivers and also because of the use of freshwater resources for producing food to feed a growing population of people worldwide.”

then, on tuesday, the united nations published its global biodiversity outlook report, assessing the progress—or lack thereof—of the 196 countries who signed onto the aichi biodiversity targets in 2010. this ten year plan outlined ambitious goals to staunch the collapse of biodiversity across the globe. yet according to the u.n.’s report, the world has collectively failed to reach a single one of those goals in the last decade, reports catrin einhorn for the new york times.

the u.n. report did contain bright spots. for instance, experts pointed to the efficacy of human-led conservation efforts, such as a program in pakistan that protects snow leopards and a campaign to save the japanese crested ibis from extinction, reports matthew green for reuters. without conservation efforts, the study estimates that the numbers of bird and mammal extinctions would have been twice as high during the last decade.

the countries also partially met some of the u.n. targets, including “preventing invasive species” and “conserving protected areas,” reports jessie yeung for cnn.

“[t]he rate of biodiversity loss is unprecedented in human history and pressures are intensifying,” says elizabeth maruma mrema, executive secretary of the convention of biological diversity for the u.n., in a statement.

“earth’s living systems as a whole are being compromised,” adds mrema. “and the more humanity exploits nature in unsustainable ways and undermines its contributions to people, the more we undermine our own wellbeing, security and prosperity.”

both the wwf and the u.n. cite the covid-19 pandemic as an example of the threat posed to humans by a loss of global biodiversity. a previous u.n. report released in july found that as humans continue to disrupt ecosystems, the risk of zoonotic diseases that jump from animals to humans will increase.

shaw tells the post that despite the dire data, urgent action by the global community could still reverse the worst of biodiversity loss trends. in a study published in nature last week, researchers used the wwf models to suggest ways to “bend the curve” of biodiversity decline, as nathan rott reports for npr. these measures include increasing land conservation and overhauling global food production.

however, as rott notes, the report indicates that the ever-growing population of humans has led to an “ecological imbalance,” where society requires more resources to survive than can be produced. according to their models, the researchers conclude: “the human enterprise currently demands 1.56 times more than the amount that earth can regenerate.”"

Rank-and-file union members snub Biden for Trump,9,ixllnj,https://www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/09/22/donald-trump-union-support-snub-joe-biden-418329?__twitter_impression=true,10,1600803164.0,,"joe biden has pitched himself to voters as a “union man,” a son of scranton, pa., who respects the dignity of work and will defend organized labor if he wins the white house.

to rank-and-file members in some unions, especially the building trades, it doesn’t matter. they’re still firmly in donald trump’s camp.

labor leaders have worked for months to sell their members on biden, hoping to avoid a repeat of 2016 when donald trump outperformed among union members and won the white house. but despite a bevy of national union endorsements for biden and years of what leaders call attacks on organized labor from the trump administration, local officials in critical battleground states said support for trump remains solid.

“we haven’t moved the needle here,” said mike knisley, executive secretary-treasurer with the ohio state building and construction trades council, who estimated that about half of his members voted for trump in 2016 and will do so again. “even if given all the information that’s been put out there, all the facts — just pick an issue that the president has had his hands in — it doesn’t make a difference.”

among members of north america’s building trades unions, there is a dead heat in six swing states, with biden receiving 48 percent of the vote and trump 47 percent, according to an internal poll shared with politico.

politico dispatch: september 22 just a handful of states could decide who becomes the next president. politico reporters from across the country break down what it will take for donald trump and joe biden to win over the most critical voters.

“he has a very, very, very solid foundation of our members,” said james williams, a vice president of the international union of painters and allied trades, whose surveys of members painted a similar picture. “they connect with his messaging and a lot of the fear-mongering going all the way back to when he was first elected with, ‘be afraid of the immigrant. the immigrant’s here to take your job.’ that resonated with our membership. they feel like their way of life and their way of living is under attack and without really understanding the dynamics at play. i mean, the immigrant worker is being abused by employers.”

trump’s support in some unions could provide an opening for him in the midwest, particularly in the key rust belt states that powered trump’s victory in 2016 — pennsylvania, michigan and wisconsin — where union voters have a sizable impact. roughly one in six voters nationwide is either a union member or comes from a union household, according to a gallup poll earlier this month, and that number rises to more than one in four in states like michigan.

those voters, historically a bedrock of democratic support, shifted away from the party in 2016, according to exit polls. hillary clinton won union voters by less than half as much as former president barack obama had four years earlier — and that swing alone may have been enough to account for her losses in pennsylvania, wisconsin and michigan, one analysis found. even if biden takes back the white house, there could be far-reaching impacts on the democratic party and labor movement if that trendline persists.

the question this year is whether biden can win those union members back, and by how much. some labor leaders said there is cause for hope for biden: while many trump voters remain firm in their support, they said, biden is winning over more of their members than clinton did. they attributed that in part to trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

“we’re seeing a whole different attitude toward joe biden than we saw mostly because trump has a record of failure. biden has a record of being there for us,” said rick bloomingdale, president of the pennsylvania afl-cio. “it’s just a different feel out there. obviously, we still have members who support trump.”

though it showed a virtual tie, the nabtu survey represented a seven-point drop for trump from march, the first change for the president in two years, said sean mcgarvey, the union president. he attributed the change to trump’s management of covid-19, calling it “the greatest mistake of his presidency.”

“it’s going to be close among my members between biden and president trump, but there’s been dramatic change in the last six months,” mcgarvey said, adding that if trump had been more aggressive toward the coronavirus, “he’d be bulletproof. we wouldn’t even be talking about joe biden now.”

however, even as they praise the democratic presidential nominee as a less-flawed candidate than clinton, other union leaders said they fear there’s nothing they can say to the trump supporters among their ranks to sway their opinion between now and november.

they said parts of biden’s record, such as his past support for the north american free trade agreement and the trans-pacific partnership, hurt him, and that some members still look to the pre-pandemic economy under trump as a high point.

“it doesn’t seem like there’s anybody changing their minds,” said don furko, president of the united steelworkers local 1557 in clairton, pennsylvania, who said the majority of his membership is backing trump.

in northern minnesota, local usw officials are working to educate members on steps trump has taken to attack organized labor and encouraging them to vote for their jobs rather than on social issues like immigration, said john arbogast, staff representative for district 11. but, he added, “you’re not going to change a trumpster’s opinion.”

tj ducklo, biden’s national press secretary, said the former vice president “sees this election as park avenue vs. scranton — a choice between someone who has always stood up for working people and believes this country was built by unions, and donald trump, who punishes the middle class with tax cuts that only benefit him and his rich friends.”

samantha zager, deputy national press secretary for the trump campaign, said, “throughout his 50 years in politics, biden has consistently put special interests ahead of american workers — including in his promise to shut the economy back down if he were elected — and that’s why president trump is seeing strong support from union members.”

at a national level, most union officials have largely lined up behind biden, appearing with him at events and acting as campaign surrogates. but they said their efforts to spread that enthusiasm have been hindered by the pandemic, which has severely limited organized labor’s in-person ground game.

with the exception of unite here, most unions have avoided door-knocking in an effort to prevent spreading the virus. labor officials said some members don’t share their cell phone numbers, which is a challenge when their efforts to boost biden have shifted to phone-banking, texting and other virtual work. so-called labor walks — organized labor’s term of art for canvassing — are largely no more.

pat eiding, president of the philadelphia afl-cio, said trades leaders need to talk with their members more often about biden to be effective. a refinery closed recently in the city and trump supporters have misleadingly made some union workers believe he'll bring back the facilities, he said.

the evidence that member outreach works, he said, is the 2008 presidential election, when they spoke frequently with the rank-and-file at job sites as early as 5 a.m. and overcame prejudice in their unions against an african-american democratic nominee.

“we said ... the man’s black. but here's the issues: he’ll protect you and your jobs,’” he said. “and when we were able to go directly to members, instead of just being on a bully pulpit, we were able to get them to vote for obama. and that was not an easy thing to do.”

furko said the usw’s political team is knocking on doors, but it has not come to distribute materials and share information about biden at the plant and union hall as they normally would due to the virus — they simply sent fliers instead.

“they know that they’re there if people want to come,” he said. “but i still have at least 2,000 pieces of paper on my table.”

in a sign of the tension among construction workers about trump, at least one building trades union has not yet endorsed a candidate in the presidential race: the international union of operating engineers.

“everybody seems to be dancing on this thing. but if you go by my house, you’ll see on the lawn a biden sign,” said robert heenan, second vice president of iuoe. among rank-and-file members in pennsylvania, where he is business manager of local 542, he added, “i think a lot of them are going for trump.”

the united mine workers of america have also held back an endorsement. members turned against clinton in 2016 when she said she would put coal miners out of business, and many are staying away from biden because they fear he is also anti-coal, said chuck knisell, an international vice president of umwa’s district 2.

“the biggest argument that i have from our membership is that this isn’t a blue-collar, working-class democratic party that my dad or mom was in,” knisell said. “it’s morphed into something different.”

but within more liberal unions, especially those with large numbers of black and latino members, leaders report major excitement for biden — which could potentially offset gop gains in the building trades as well as other moderate- and conservative-leaning unions. public-sector unions in major cities likewise tend to be a font of democratic support.

mary kay henry, president of the service employees international union, said 70 percent of her rank-and-file members backed clinton. this year, she said, at least 80 percent are supporting biden.

“and his pick of kamala harris has probably moved the needle — we’re just going back into the field with a poll — to 90 percent,” she said. “our members are on fire for the biden-harris ticket.”

union officials said there is also some evidence that biden may be making inroads among another camp of rank-and-file members: those who disliked both candidates in 2016 and chose to vote third party.

labor leaders have zeroed in on those members as the most persuadable this year. some estimate that third-party voters in the union ranks were as big a problem for clinton as the voters who flipped to trump, so winning that cohort alone could give biden a significant boost.

“going into this election, those folks who sort of felt like they couldn’t vote for trump in 2016, but really weren’t enthusiastic about clinton, really understand what’s at stake now,” said michael podhorzer, political director with the afl-cio. “i think that’s something of a bump that can be counted on.”

ryan bennett, who’s in charge of roughly 800 active and 200 retired plumbers and pipefitters as part of ua local 174 in coopersville, mich., said he’s starting to hear from members who view the past three-plus years of the trump administration as a series of broken promises for organized labor.

“they’ve all seen that none of that has come to fruition,” bennett said, referring to trump’s pledges to bring back manufacturing jobs and overhaul the country’s infrastructure. “a lot of those members that were in the middle are going to end up on joe biden’s side.”"
"Release WikiLeaks' Julian Assange, say current and former world leaders",137,ixmqbx,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1240597?__twitter_impression=true,29,1600807783.0,,"london — more than 160 current and former world leaders, lawmakers and diplomats have endorsed a call for the u.k. to free wikileaks founder julian assange and stop his extradition to the u.s.

the signatories of the open letter, addressed to u.k. prime minister boris johnson and several government ministers, included the president of argentina and two former presidents of brazil, dilma rousseff and luiz inacio lula da silva.

assange, 49, is currently fighting extradition to the u.s. where he faces up to 175 years in prison on espionage charges over wikileaks' release of confidential diplomatic cables in 2010 and 2011. the letter was first written by the group lawyers for assange in august, and then received the support of the international signatories whose names were released on monday.

it laid out several legal reasons why assange shouldn’t be extradited, including the claim that he wouldn’t face a fair trial in the u.s., and that he would “be exposed to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”

his extradition “would gravely endanger freedom of the press,” the letter said.

“this demonstrates the growing opposition around the world to u.s. efforts to extradite and prosecute assange, and the political nature of this case,” assange's lawyer, jennifer robinson, told nbc news.

many of the letter’s signatories, which also include venezuelan leader nicolás maduro and former ecuadoran leader rafael correa, are fierce critics of the u.s. and have previously spoken out against american foreign policy.

last week, robinson told a london court that assange was offered a presidential pardon in 2017 by then-rep. dana rohrabacher, r-calif., and trump associate charles johnson if he helped to resolve the ""ongoing speculation about russian involvement"" in the hacking of democratic national committee emails leaked during the 2016 u.s. election campaign.

at the hearing in london on friday, james lewis, prosecutor for the u.s. government, said: ""the position of the government is we don't contest these things were said. we obviously do not accept the truth of what was said by others.""

assange has been in a british prison since his ejection from the ecuadorian embassy in london in april 2019. he was granted asylum by ecuador in 2012 over fears he would face possible extradition to the u.s. related to his work with wikileaks.

prosecutors in the u.s. say assange conspired with u.s. army intelligence analyst chelsea manning to hack into a pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files.

his supporters say the leaked documents exposed u.s. military wrongdoing, and argue he was acting as a journalist.

among the files published by wikileaks in 2010 was a video of a 2007 apache helicopter attack by american forces in baghdad that killed 11 people, including two reuters journalists.

the extradition hearing, which began in february but was postponed in april because of the pandemic, is due to last until early october."
"""It's Dog-Whistle Base Stuff"": DeSantis Launches Trump-Styled Protest Crackdown",194,ixqs7j,https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/09/21/its-dog-whistle-base-stuff-desantis-launches-trump-styled-protest-crackdown-1317656,32,1600820824.0,,"florida gov. ron desantis attends an event featuring president donald trump earlier this month. | evan vucci/ap photo florida ‘it’s dog-whistle base stuff’: desantis launches trump-styled protest crackdown

tallahassee — florida republican gov. ron desantis on monday outlined an aggressive plan to crack down on what he calls “violent agitators,” turning a huge spotlight to a political wedge issue president donald trump’s reelection campaign has focused on for weeks.

the announcement amplifies florida’s role in a polarizing national fight trump and other republicans are waging against joe biden and democrats, who argue the gop is using small pockets of violence to punish all forms of protest and critics of police misconduct.

“if you know that a ton of bricks will rain down on you, then i think people will think twice about engaging in this type of conduct,” desantis said during a tampa-area press conference.

flanked by republican legislative leaders and law enforcement officials, desantis outlined forthcoming legislation he said will create a series of new felonies for those involved in protests that turn violent or cause property damage, and threatens to cut state funding for cities that “defund the police.""

desantis, who did not mention trump during the press conference, acknowledged the timing of the “combatting violence, disorder and looting and law enforcement protection act” was designed to put “law and order” at the political center in the nation’s largest swing state during the final weeks of a campaign otherwise dominated by trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. while adding fresh fuel to a white-hot presidential contest, desantis' efforts are certain to be used to rattle voters in local legislative races, particularly the florida senate, where democrats need to flip just three seats to secure a 20-20 tie in the chamber.

“you have an obligation to tell others where you stand on this bill,” desantis said, announcing the new push the same week mail-in ballots will be sent to florida voters. “are you going to stand with victims, are you going to stand with law enforcement, are you going to stand with law and order in these communities, or are you going to stand with the mob?”

the proposal, the first rolled out by desantis since the outset of the pandemic, makes it a third-degree felony to be in a gathering of more than seven people that causes injury or damage; a third-degree felony to block traffic during a protest held without a permit; blocks state funding for cities that “defund the police,” and creates a new six-month mandatory minimum jail sentence for anyone who strikes a law enforcement officer during a “disorderly assembly.” it would also, among other things, give legal liability to a driver who is “fleeing for safety from a mob.”

the legislation is not filed, so the definition of things like “mob” and ""defund the police,"" a broad rallying cry for overhauling law enforcement, are not yet clear.

calls for policing changes come on the heels of demonstrations that broke out nationwide after the may 25 death of george floyd, a black man killed by a white cop in minneapolis. the protests were led by social justice groups such as black lives matter, and included demonstrations throughout florida, including in downtown tallahassee just blocks from the governor’s mansion.

tallahassee police initially took a light-handed approach toward the protests until an aug. 29 incident where a counter-protester pulled out a handgun. then the city cracked down, arresting 17 people who were involved in a protest that unfolded sept. 5.

leon county state attorney jack campbell said most of the tallahassee protesters were peaceful, but other groups were using them as a screen to commit crimes.

“this proposed legislation gives us tools to separate the peaceful from the violent,” campbell said in an email to politico. “it also establishes the legislature’s direction that we severely punish those who promote violence through the corruption of these demonstrations.”

with republican leaders in the legislature backing the governor, the issue will no doubt dominate the early stages of florida’s 2021 legislative session. the bill will get early committee hearings and be vocally opposed by democrats at every turn.

“most of this stuff is already illegal, he is just hell bent on silencing any voice of opposition,” incoming house minority leader evan jenne said. “we will be ready to fight”

he said the move is clearly motivated by a desire to turn the focus in the must-win state from the coronavirus pandemic to rhetoric that mirrors the president’s stump speeches and political ads.

“none of this is about policy,” jenne said. “it’s about buoying president trump, who has slipped precipitously in the polls. it’s dog-whistle base stuff.”

desantis was joined during the press conference by senate president-elect wilton simpson and house speaker-designate chris sprowls. both republicans promised to file the plan for next year’s legislative session. they have also spent the summer also working behind the scenes of several legislative races.

""if you own a business and someone is looting your business, you're going to call law enforcement,"" simpson said. ""they deserve the backing to the fullest extent of the law.""

the aclu of florida quickly slammed the governor’s proposal.

“gov. desantis’ proposal is undemocratic and hostile to americans’ shared values,” said micah kubic, the aclu of florida’s executive director. “this effort has one goal: silence, criminalize, and penalize floridians who want to see justice for black lives lost to racialized violence and brutality at the hands of law enforcement.”

roger weeden, an orlando attorney with the left-leaning national lawyers guild, called desantis’ proposal “completely unconstitutional.” he said without an actual legislative bill, monday’s announcement was nothing more than a political stunt.

“this is all part of trump’s narrative that the streets are unsafe and cities are in danger,” weeden said. “all i see is a bunch of red herrings.”"
"Philly official warns of ""electoral chaos"" in Pennsylvania due to ""naked"" mail-in ballots",39,ixtt0y,https://www.axios.com/pennsylvania-naked-ballots-mail-in-voting-biden-9bbcf26f-c9d1-49bf-8939-0422242ed36e.html,14,1600829921.0,,"pennsylvania's supreme court ordered state officials last week to throw out mail-in ballots submitted without a required inner ""secrecy"" envelope in november's election, the philadelphia inquirer reports.

the state of play: the decision went under the radar alongside the simultaneous decision to extend the time that mail-in ballots could be counted, but philadelphia's top elections official warned state legislators this week that throwing out so-called ""naked ballots"" could bring ""electoral chaos"" to the state and cause ""tens of thousands of votes"" to be thrown out — potentially tipping the presidential election.

pennsylvania requires voters to place their ballots in an unmarked ""secrecy"" envelope before placing that inside another mailing envelope.

historically, only about 5% of pennsylvanians have voted by mail as the state had required an excuse to vote absentee. this year marks the first time that the state has adopted no-excuse absentee voting, so many will be voting by mail amid the coronavirus pandemic — and using the double-envelope system — for the first time.

the decision to reject ""naked ballots"" didn't apply during the primary earlier this year, which was the first use of expanded mail-in voting, so it's unclear how widespread the mistake may be. however, 6.4% of ballots were ""naked"" during last november's municipal election in philadelphia, which was conducted under the more restrictive absentee system.

why it matters: polls have found that more democrats than republicans plan to vote by mail, so thrown-out ""naked ballots"" are more likely to be cast for joe biden. president trump carried pennsylvania by just 44,000 votes in 2016.

""pennsylvania is so important that our model gives trump an 84 percent chance of winning the presidency if he carries the state — and it gives biden a 96 percent chance of winning if pennsylvania goes blue,"" fivethirtyeight's nathaniel rakich noted in a recent analysis.

if tens of thousands of ""naked ballots"" are rejected by election officials, it could be enough to swing the result in a tipping-point state.

driving the news: the issue has taken on such importance that the democratic national committee released an ad on thursday to take pennsylvania voters through the step-by-step process for completing their mail-in ballot.

the big picture: the trump campaign, the republican national committee and other pennsylvania republicans filed the lawsuit against some state election rules, including the ""naked"" ballots.

what they're saying: ""[r]ecent actions by the pennsylvania supreme court have set pennsylvania up to be the subject of significant post-election controversy, the likes of which we have not seen since florida in 2000,"" lisa deeley, the chair of philadelphia's city commissioners, wrote to state legislators.

""i hope you consider this letter as me being a canary in the coal mine.""

the bottom line: cook political report's dave wasserman called the situation ""a foreseeable train wreck.""

portland, maine (ap) — ranked choice voting will be used for the first time in a presidential race in the u.s. under a ruling tuesday by the maine supreme court, which concluded that a gop-led petition drive intended to prevent its use came up short.

the supreme judicial court concluded the maine republican party failed to reach the threshold of signatures needed for a “people’s veto” referendum aimed at rejecting a state law that expands ranked choice voting to the presidential election.

“this is a powerful moment for ranked choice voting supporters: voters will, for the first time, use ranked choice voting to elect the highest office in the country,” said rob richie, president and ceo of fairvote, which advocates for the voting reform.

the court’s decision, just six weeks before the election, was issued after the state already began printing ballots using a grid-style for ranked elections.

“as we have already printed the ballots, due to the federal deadlines we must meet to provide ballots for overseas and military voters, this decision comes as a great relief and avoids the complications, confusion and expense that would have arisen from reprinting and reissuing ballots,” said secretary of state matthew dunlap.

under the voting system, voters are allowed to rank all candidates on the ballot. if no one wins a majority of first-place votes, then there are additional tabulations, aided by computers, in which last-place finishers are eliminated and votes reallocated based on those supporters’ second-place choices. transporting the ballots to augusta for additional tabulations delays results for about a week.

in maine, the presidential ballot will feature five names, including republican president donald trump and democratic challenger joe biden. ranked voting will also be used in u.s. house races and the closely watched u.s. senate race between republican incumbent susan collins and democrat sara gideon, the maine house speaker.

the voting system adds another wrinkle to the presidential contest in maine, which — as one of two states that divide electoral votes — already does things differently.

in the last presidential election, democrat hillary clinton won three electoral votes while trump won one electoral vote in the 2nd congressional district, underscoring political divisions between the state’s liberal, urban south and conservative north.

the ranked choice voting system, approved by maine voters in 2016, has become a partisan issue in the state, where republican u.s. rep. bruce poliquin was ousted in 2018 despite collecting the most first-place votes.

supporters say the ranked choice voting system eliminates the impact of so-called “spoiler candidates” and produces a majority winner. critics say it’s unnecessarily complicated and disenfranchises voters who don’t understand it.

full coverage: election 2020

the constitutionality of the voting system has been twice upheld by a federal judge in maine. however, ranked voting is not used in the governor’s race or legislative contests because it runs afoul of the maine constitution.

the fast-paced, 11th-hour legal machinations resolved tuesday followed the secretary of state’s rejection of the referendum, ruling the gop fell short of the needed level of 67,067 signatures of registered voters to force a referendum. the maine gop had appealed that decision and a state judge reinstated enough signatures to surpass the minimum by 22 signatures.

the issue before the state supreme court focused on a narrow question of whether signature gatherers must be registered to vote in the town where they are circulating petitions at the time they started.

the supreme judicial court ruled unanimously tuesday that the requirements don’t violate first amendment rights of signature gatherers. that conclusion invalidated 988 signatures, delivering a defeat to the gop.

but the maine gop wasn’t yet conceding on tuesday. the party is “exploring further options for review by the federal courts to protect maine voters’ rights to be heard,” its chair, demi kouzounas, said.

anna kellar, executive director for the league of women voters, which supports the voting reform, said the court’s decision is a victory for “every mainer who sat around kitchen tables and in basements years ago, wondering how we could ensure more votes would be heard in our elections.”

"Whistleblower on Jared Kushner’s COVID task force says he was told to ""fudge"" death data model",54,iy2phk,https://news.yahoo.com/whistleblower-jared-kushner-covid-task-211001251.html,15,1600860748.0,,"jared kushner

senior advisor to the president jared kushner participates in a press briefing at the white house on september 4, 2020 in washington, dc. drew angerer/getty images

a grandson of former attorney general robert f. kennedy told the new yorker that he was the whistleblower that sounded the alarm on presidential son-in-law jared kushner's coronavirus task force to congress.

max kennedy jr., 26, told the new yorker's jane mayer that he sent an anonymous whistleblower complaint to congress in april ""detailing dangerous incompetence"" in the administration's pandemic response, according to the report.

""americans are facing a crisis of tragic proportions, and there is an urgent need for an effective, efficient and bold response. from my few weeks as a volunteer, i believe we are falling short,"" he said in the complaint in april. ""i am writing to alert my representatives of these challenges and to ask that they do everything possible to help front-line health-care workers and other americans in need.""

""i just couldn't sleep,"" kennedy told mayer. ""i was so distressed and disturbed by what i'd seen.""

kennedy was advised by a friend to volunteer for kushner's ""impact team"" and decided to jump at the opportunity to join the supply-chain task force in march believing that the job ""didn't seem political.""

kennedy, who was surrounded by other 20-something volunteers from various fields with no experience in procuring medical supplies, said he was surprised that they were not intended to be support staff for the procurement team.

""we were the team,"" he told mayer. ""we were the entire frontline team for the federal government.""

the team was tasked with procuring much-needed supplies while equipped with only their personal laptops and private email accounts. kennedy said that as the weeks went on, he was disturbed by president donald trump's continued efforts to downplay the pandemic.

""i knew from that room that he was saying things that just weren't true,"" he said, adding that the team was too small to meet the challenge.

story continues

kennedy told mayer that brad smith, one of the leaders of the task force, ""pressured [kennedy] to create a model fudging the projected number of fatalities,"" according to the report. smith told him that he wanted the model to revise down the number of projected deaths, arguing that experts' models were ""too severe,"" according to kennedy.

""i don't know the first thing about disease modelling,"" kennedy said he told smith, adding that he turned down the task.

the country marked 200,000 deaths this week, though experts believe the number is even higher.

kennedy told the outlet that the team was also directed to prioritize requests from trump's friends and supporters, including ""special attention"" for fox news host jeanine pirro, who demanded masks for a hospital she favored.

the task force ultimate failed to get enough equipment, mayer wrote, forcing hospital workers to reuse potentially contaminated equipment or improvise with garbage bags while states bid against each other for critical supplies.

one of the task force officials told kennedy that trump was a ""marketing genius"" because he ""personally came up with the strategy of blaming the states"" for the failure to procure equipment.

kennedy ultimately quit the team in april and landed a gig with the democratic party.

kushner has dismissed what he called ""hysterical"" media reports that the administration's response was highly inadequate, declaring it a ""success"" despite more than 200,000 deaths.

his ""shadow"" task force has been widely criticized from within, with one senior official describing the team of young entrepreneurs to the new york times as a ""frat party"" that ""descended from a ufo and invaded the federal government.""

kushner, like trump, initially sought to downplay the threat posed by the pandemic and rejected federal action to help states desperately in need of medical supplies, according to vanity fair.

""like trump — when it comes to fighting the coronavirus outbreak — kushner appears more concerned with the stock market than with public health,"" gq's luke darby wrote in may. ""one republican briefed on the administration's coronavirus response told vanity fair that as early as mid-january, advisers were sounding alarms, but 'jared kept saying the stock market would go down, and trump wouldn't get reelected.'""

kennedy told mayer he came forward despite signing a non-disclosure agreement because he doubts the administration can silence him in court.

""if you see something that might be illegal, and cause thousands of civilian lives to be lost, a person has to speak out,"" he said, adding that the administration's pandemic response ""was like a family office meets organized crime, melded with 'lord of the flies.' it was a government of chaos.""

Republican Inquiry Finds No Evidence of Wrongdoing by Biden - The report delivered on Wednesday appeared to be little more than a rehashing of unproven allegations that echoed a Russian disinformation campaign.,432,iydbkj,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/us/politics/biden-inquiry-republicans-johnson.html,60,1600906911.0,,"though their scope was ultimately broader, republicans set out to scrutinize a specific claim raised by mr. trump: that mr. biden had corruptly pushed for the ouster of ukraine’s top prosecutor, who had been investigating burisma, as a favor to his son. mr. trump’s pursuit of that charge, including the pressure he tried to put on ukraine’s leader to look into it, is what prompted his impeachment last year.

the senators turned up no evidence to support it. current and former government officials testified that the decision to remove the prosecutor had not been merely mr. biden’s position, but that of most western nations determined through a rigorous policy process.

the report’s lead finding — that hunter biden’s presence on the burisma board posed a challenge for american diplomats — rested heavily on the testimony of george p. kent, a state department official involved in ukraine policy. mr. kent raised concerns in 2015 and 2016, including with mr. biden’s staff, that the millions of dollars in payments to hunter biden by burisma made it “very awkward for all u.s. officials pushing an anticorruption agenda in ukraine.”

but mr. kent’s statements are not new. he had a prominent role in the house’s impeachment inquiry last fall, when he detailed his concerns about hunter biden, but also said he “did not witness any efforts by any u.s. official to shield burisma from scrutiny.”

“so there was no time, as i’ve testified, that the u.s. government, the u.s. embassy ever made a decision” about the owner of burisma or the firm itself “where we took the presence of a private citizen on the board into account,” he told mr. johnson’s staff. other former diplomats, including the ambassador to ukraine at the time, made similar statements.

neither mr. biden’s campaign nor mr. johnson would say whether he had sought information directly from the former vice president, and a lawyer for hunter biden did not respond to a request for comment.

in an interview last week before the report’s release, mr. johnson said he was simply conducting the type of oversight with which his committee was tasked, and suggested that the investigation had been thrust upon him because mr. biden had opted to challenge mr. trump. the senator said that he “never thought joe biden should run for president,” and hinted that the former vice president had cognitive problems, a baseless attack frequently hurled by mr. trump."
Former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison charged with wanton endangerment in Breonna Taylor case,46,iyfyeu,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-louisville-police-officer-brett-hankison-charged-breonna-taylor-s-n1238036,15,1600914677.0,,"one of the police officers involved in the shooting death of breonna taylor in her home in louisville, kentucky, in march was charged wednesday with first-degree wanton endangerment, but the officer whose shot killed taylor was not indicted.

judge annie o’connell announced the charges against the former louisville detective, brett hankison, who was fired in june, during a grand jury proceeding. a warrant will be issued for his arrest, o'connell said.

the charges accuse hankison of firing blindly into an apartment and recklessly endangering taylor’s neighbors, but do not charge him with firing at or killing taylor. two other officers involved in the march 13 incident, detective myles cosgrove and sgt. jonathan mattingly, were not charged.

cosgrove fired the shot that killed taylor, according to kentucky attorney general daniel cameron, but the grand jury considered his action justifiable.

at a news conference wednesday, cameron acknowledged that there had been calls for all three officers to be charged, including from taylor's family, who had called for nothing less than manslaughter charges.

but, cameron said, ""our investigation showed, and the grand jury agreed, that mattingly and cosgrove were justified in their return of deadly fire after having been fired upon"" by taylor's boyfriend, kenneth walker.

ben crump, an attorney for taylor's family, expressed outrage at the jefferson county grand jury's decision to indict hankison ""for bullets that went into other apartments but nothing for the murder of breonna taylor.""

""this is outrageous and offensive!"" he tweeted.

mattingly's attorney, kent j. wicker, said the grand jury's decision not to charge his client or cosgrove ""shows that the system worked and that grand jurors recognized and respected the facts of the case.""

""the death of breonna taylor is a tragedy. but these officers did not act in a reckless or unprofessional manner,"" wicker said in a statement. ""they did their duty, performed their roles as law enforcement officers and, above all, did not break the law.""

hankison was booked into the shelby county detention center and released wednesday afternoon on a $15,000 full-cash bond, his lawyer, stewart matthews, said.

matthews said hankison will plead not guilty at an upcoming arraignment.

kentucky attorney general says use of force by 2 officers was 'justified'

taylor, 26, an emergency medical technician, was shot and killed in her home on march 13, after police officers with a no-knock warrant broke down her door seeking evidence in a narcotics investigation. the target of the probe did not live at the location.

walker, her boyfriend, fired a shot at the front door, striking mattingly in the leg, according to police. walker, who had a license to carry firearms, said he believed it was a home invasion.

it had been previously reported that taylor was shot five times during the raid, but cameron said she was struck six times. an fbi analysis determined the fatal shot was fired by cosgrove.

cameron said that his investigation shows that officers knocked and announced themselves as police before entering taylor's apartment. he said this was corroborated by a civilian witness who was near taylor’s apartment on the night of the shooting.

other witnesses have said they did not hear police announce their presence.

“in other words, the warrant was not served as a no-knock warrant,"" the attorney general said.

he also noted that the three officers “had no known involvement in the preceding investigation or obtainment of the search warrant.""

""they were called in to duty as extra personnel,"" cameron said at his news conference.

according to the attorney general, when officers were unable to get anyone to answer the door at taylor's apartment, ""the decision was made to open the door.""

mattingly then entered the residence and saw taylor and walker standing at the end of the hall. cameron said walker was holding a gun and fired, striking mattingly, who returned gunfire.

“this all took place in a matter of seconds,” cameron said, adding that mattingly fired six shots and “almost simultaneously” cosgrove fired 16 times from the doorway. he said there is no evidence that hankison's bullets hit taylor.

speaking at the white house wednesday, president donald trump praised cameron's investigation, telling reporters that the attorney general is a ""star"" and saying he had done a ""fantastic job.""

democratic presidential candidate joe biden also weighed in, saying in a statement that for many, the grand jury's decision hadn't answered the question of whether justice can be equally applied in the united states. biden offered a series of police reforms that he said were necessary to ""deliver justice for breonna.""

crump, meanwhile, challenged cameron’s conclusion that authorities had announced themselves and he accused authorities of trying to cover up the death of a “black woman who posed no threat and was living her best life. yet here we are, without justice for breonna, her family and the black community.”

“if hankison’s behavior constituted wanton endangerment of the people in the apartments next to hers, then it should also be considered wanton endangerment of breonna,” he said, adding that it was “ironic” that the only charges brought in the case were for the shots fired into the apartment of a white neighbor.

“this amounts to the most egregious disrespect of black people, especially black women, killed by police in america, and it’s indefensible, regardless of how attorney general daniel cameron seeks to justify it,” he said.

speaking to reporters after cameron’s announcement, gov. andy beshear said he wanted the attorney general to release the racial and demographic make-up of the grand jury. beshear also asked cameron to post some of the underlying evidence in the case online.

“everyone can and should be informed,” he said. “those feeling frustration, those feeling hurt — they deserve to know more. the ability to process those facts helps everybody.”

a spokeswoman for cameron, elizabeth kuhn, said in a statement to nbc news that the office wouldn't post any of the evidence because it would ""compromise"" a federal investigation into the incident ""and violate a prosecutor's ethical duties.""

kuhn didn't immediately say if cameron would release other grand jury information.

beshear, who served as kentucky’s attorney general before he was elected governor in 2018, declined to answer a reporter’s question about whether he believed cameron’s investigation was flawed.

taylor's death has sparked months of protests. ahead of wednesday's announcement, the city battened down in anticipation of possible unrest.

federal buildings were closed to the public this week, with first-floor windows of the u.s. district courthouse boarded up; barricades were placed downtown; and louisville police declared a state of emergency.

mayor greg fischer said at a news conference wednesday that he was imposing a 72-hour curfew starting at 9 p.m.

""our goal is ensuring space and opportunity for people to gather and express first amendment rights while maintaining public safety,"" he said.

""we’re asking people to do their public protest during light. that’s the purpose of having the curfew. most of the violence we’ve encountered over the past few months has occurred after dark.""

state rep. charles booker, who played a major role in racial justice demonstrations in louisville over the summer, spoke directly to protesters wednesday, saying during the governor’s news conference that “this moment is about protecting the movement.”

“keep demanding change,” he said. “breonna, thank you for being the light. we’ll keep fighting to honor your name.”

asked during a news conference with the mayor wednesday if protesters who took to the streets after cameron’s announcement had been arrested, louisville assistant police chief robert schroeder said several people had been taken into custody but he didn’t have details.

hankison fired for shooting 'blindly'

hankison was fired in june for “wantonly and blindly” firing into taylor's apartment, according to his termination letter. cosgrove and mattingly, who, like hankison, fired their weapons during the raid, were placed on administrative leave.

also placed on leave was detective joshua jaynes, who applied for the warrant used in the raid.

cosgrove, mattingly and jaynes along with three other officers — detectives tony james, michael campbell and michael nobles — are all under internal investigation by the police department's professional standards unit, police said.

mayor fischer said wednesday that the grand jury’s conclusion confirmed the decision to fire hankison. asked if he would terminate cosgrove and mattingly, fischer said if the internal investigation showed they committed “fireable” offenses ""that would be the right thing to do.”

that police probe is separate from the state attorney general's investigation, which began in may. the fbi also announced in may that it was investigating the shooting.

in audio of investigators’ interviews that was released in july, mattingly, who led the late-night raid, insisted that officers knocked and announced themselves.

in walker's interview with investigators, however, he said that there was banging on the door but that he and taylor never heard anyone say ""police,"" according to the audio. walker told the investigator that he and taylor asked who it was and when they got no response, he reached for his firearm.

during the interviews by the louisville metro police department’s public integrity unit, the investigator questioning mattingly said officers' use of a battering ram to break open the apartment door was ""the most passive way in"" to the apartment and said that mattingly “rightfully” returned fire after walker fired a shot.

taylor's mother filed a lawsuit against hankison, cosgrove and mattingly, alleging that they did not announce themselves when they raided the home after midnight and engaged in ""blindly firing"" more than 20 shots into the apartment.

taylor's address had been listed on the police search warrant based on officers' belief that a suspect, her ex-boyfriend, had used her home to keep drugs or stash money.

the wrongful-death complaint ended last week with taylor's family reaching a $12 million settlement with the city, the largest in louisville's history.

ryan nichols, president of the local police union, the river city fraternal order of police lodge 614, told local station wlky that the settlement was premature as it came before the completion of the attorney general's probe.

""especially if the investigation shows the actions the police took were within the boundaries of the law and they didn't violate anything, maybe that settlement doesn't look the same,"" he said.

although the city admitted to no wrongdoing under terms of the settlement, the mayor said the agreement was ""an acknowledgment of the need for reform.""

the louisville police union has not responded to repeated requests for comment on the case from nbc news.

while taylor's fatal shooting happened in mid-march, it didn't gain much national attention until the family's lawsuit was filed two months later.

taylor's death came 2-1/2 weeks after the fatal shooting of ahmaud arbery by civilians in brunswick, georgia, and 2-1/2 months before the death of george floyd while in police custody in minneapolis.

the deaths sparked national protests that shined a harsh light on the nation's long history of systemic racism, police brutality and the extrajudicial killings of black americans."

updated at 5:20 a.m. et thursday

two louisville metropolitan police officers have been shot as protesters marched to demand justice for breonna taylor following a limited indictment by a jefferson county grand jury.

the officers were fired on after responding to a separate ""shots fired call"" at about 8:30 p.m. et, chief robert schroeder said in a brief press conference wednesday evening.

one suspect has been taken into custody, schroeder said.

one officer is in stable condition, while the other is undergoing surgery. schroeder noted ""they are both non-threatening injuries.""

no names have been released.

the chief said that under the tense circumstances following the indictment by the grand jury wednesday, he is ""very concerned for the safety of [his] officers.""

hundreds of protesters swiftly began demonstrations calling for justice for breonna taylor after a grand jury decided to indict just one of the three louisville metropolitan police officers who fired nearly two dozen bullets into her apartment, killing the 26-year-old during a no-knock raid.

city and state officials, who have been expecting a decision from the grand jury all week after months of outrage and anticipation, were braced for widespread protests, preemptively calling for reinforcements from the national guard.

additionally, louisville mayor greg fischer ordered a countywide curfew from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. for 72 hours.

protests took place across the country, in new york, washington, d.c., philadelphia, las vegas and chicago, according to the associated press. police in portland, ore., declared a riot and ordered streets cleared after protesters gathered a police building in the city.

in louisville, protesters largely gathered at jefferson square park but by about 8 p.m. most had been dispersed by louisville police officers who declared an unlawful assembly and appeared to release flash grenades into the remaining crowds, the courier journal reported.

some demonstrators had set some trash fires in the streets, and others set the boards on the hall of justice aflame.

at least one group dressed in camouflage and carrying long guns was seen walking through the streets.

protests also took place

the jefferson county grand jury indicted former detective brett hankison on three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment over shooting into neighboring apartments.

but the grand jury declined to bring charges against sgt. jonathan mattingly and detective myles cosgrove, who shot six and 16 times respectively.

the state attorney general said an fbi investigation concluded that cosgrove fired the shots that killed taylor.

this is a developing story. some things reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. we will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. we will update as the situation develops"

the fbi and the u.s. attorney for the middle district of pennsylvania said thursday that they are investigating ""potential issues"" with nine military ballots in one county. they believe the ballots were opened improperly, though they have not filed any charges or taken official action.

u.s. attorney david freed noted that the investigation remains active but said he is releasing the news publicly ""based on the limited amount of time before the general election and the vital public importance of these issues.""

voting rights experts and justice department veterans, however, said that proximity to the election and the preliminary nature of the investigation make freed's announcement highly unusual.

the announcement comes as president trump continues to baselessly claim that voting by mail will lead to widespread fraud and as the justice department is under scrutiny for allegations that its decisions under attorney general william barr are increasingly directed at boosting trump's reelection efforts.

trump's campaign immediately seized on the announcement of an investigation to conclude that it was evidence democrats were trying to ""steal"" the election.

the potential voting irregularities in pennsylvania came to light after president trump mentioned them, offhand, in an interview with a fox radio host thursday.

""we have to be very careful with the ballots,"" the president told reporters later, according to a news pool report. he described what he called a ""scam"" where ballots had been found in the trash. the president has been criticizing the integrity of this year's election for months.

""we want to make sure the election is honest, and i'm not sure that it can be,"" trump continued.

discovery by local officials

officials said luzerne county elections director shelby watchilla discovered the ballots last week and the matter was immediately reported to authorities.

luzerne county district attorney stefanie salavantis then asked freed to investigate, according to the justice department's statement. that led to the involvement of the fbi.

salavantis leads a working group on the presidential commission on law enforcement and the administration of justice, which is spearheaded by attorney general barr.

according to a letter from u.s. attorney freed to the county elections director, the inquiry into luzerne county's ballot handling began monday and found that nine military ballots had been ""improperly opened"" by elections staff and ""discarded.""

he wrote that ""the majority"" of the recovered ballots and envelopes were found in an outside dumpster — seven of the nine ballots outside their official envelopes, and two that elections staff had apparently recovered and sealed back in their envelopes. he said investigators also found four ""apparently official"" absentee ballot envelopes that were empty.

all of the ballots found outside envelopes were cast for trump, freed's letter said; it's unknown who two sealed ones are for.

pennsylvania law dictates all mail ballots — military or otherwise — be securely stored until processing can begin. in the commonwealth, that's not until 7 a.m. on election day.

based on interviews, however, freed said investigators had concluded that all the envelopes — likely a very small number — that had been received by the luzerne county board of elections were opened ""as a matter of course.""

workers, he wrote, explained that the envelopes used for mail ballot requests were so similar to the ones used for returned mail ballots that they believed they would miss requests if they preserved all the envelopes unopened.

""even though your staff has made some attempts to reconstitute certain of the improperly opened ballots, there is no guarantee that any of these votes will be counted in the general election,"" he said.

highly unusual situation

voting rights experts and justice department veterans immediately reacted to freed's unusual press statement.

justin levitt, a law professor at loyola law school in los angeles, said the timing of the announcement alone raises many questions.

""it is the vital duty of government not to announce partial facts and 'potential issues' in pending investigations,"" levitt said in an email interview. ""indeed, it's quite improper to announce the fact of an inquiry. and grotesquely improper to announce whom the ballots were cast for, as if that mattered in the investigation.""

on the other hand, levitt said, it would not be improper to investigate if local officials were refusing to set aside and count valid ballots. but it's not clear that's what happened, he added.

levitt said the trump justice department had issued guidance in 2017 requiring that ""any criminal investigation by the department must be conducted in a way that minimizes the likelihood that the investigation itself may become a factor in the election.""

matt wolking, who handles rapid-response communications for the trump campaign, highlighted the probe and concluded, ""democrats are trying to steal the election.""

the pennsylvania county where authorities said they are investigating the ballots supported trump in the 2016 election.

matthew miller, a former press spokesman for president barack obama's justice department, said in a tweet that the u.s. attorney's news release amounted to an ""in kind contribution"" to the trump reelection campaign since it amplified the president's allegations about the dangers of mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic.

david thornburgh, who heads the nonpartisan election watchdog group committee of seventy, told reporter katie meyer of npr member station whyy in philadelphia that freed's release left him a bit nonplussed.

because the u.s. attorney's office offered so few details about the situation in luzerne county, thornburgh said he's concerned voters might conclude the situation is much worse than it actually is and wrongly conclude there could be wider problems, based on an anecdotal example.

""you have to be on the lookout for breakdowns in the system, but we have to be careful not to extrapolate from single-digit incidents to more systemic problems,"" he said.

washington (ap) — president donald trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses drew swift blowback thursday from both parties in congress, and lawmakers turned to unprecedented steps to ensure he can’t ignore the vote of the people. amid the uproar, trump said anew he’s not sure the election will be “honest.”

congressional leaders, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker nancy pelosi, rejected trump’s assertion that he’ll “see what happens” before agreeing to any election outcome.

many other lawmakers -- including from trump’s own republican party -- vowed to make sure voters’ wishes are followed ahead of inauguration day in january. and some democrats were taking action, including formally asking trump’s defense secretary, homeland security adviser and attorney general to declare they’ll support the nov. 3 results, whoever wins.

asked as he departed the white house for a campaign rally if the election is only legitimate if he is the winner, trump said, “we’ll see.”

the president said he wants to “make sure the election is honest, and i’m not sure that it can be.”

trump’s attacks on the upcoming vote -- almost without modern precedent in the u.s. -- are hitting amid the tumult of the campaign, as partisan tensions rage and more americans than ever are planning to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic .

it’s not the first time he has sowed doubts about the voting process. but his increased questioning before any result is setting off alarms ahead of an election day like no other. even without signs of illegality, results could be delayed because of the pandemic, leaving the nation exposed to groups or foreign countries seeking to provoke discord.

mcconnell, the gop senate leader, said in a tweet, “the winner of the november 3rd election will be inaugurated on january 20th.” he said, “there will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.”

said pelosi, “calm down, mr. president.”

“you are in the united states of america. it is a democracy,” she said, reminding trump this is not north korea, russia or other countries with strongman leaders he admires. “so why don’t you just try for a moment to honor our oath of office to the constitution of the united states.”

trump is fanning the uncertainty as he floats theories the election may be “rigged” if he loses, echoing warnings he made ahead of the 2016 voting — even though past elections have not shown substantial evidence of fraud from mail-in voting.

during a wednesday news conference, trump said, “we’re going to have to see what happens,” responding to a question about committing to the results. “you know that i’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.”

reaction to his comment was strong from capitol hill — from both parties.

lindsey graham, a trump ally and the gop chair of the senate judiciary committee, told “fox & friends” on thursday: “if republicans lose we will accept the result. if the supreme court rules in favor of joe biden, i will accept that result.

rep. liz cheney of wyoming, a member of the house gop leadership, tweeted: “the peaceful transfer of power is enshrined in our constitution and fundamental to the survival of our republic. america’s leaders swear an oath to the constitution. we will uphold that oath.”

joe biden , the democratic presidential nominee, was incredulous, “what country are we in?” he said late wednesday of trump’s comment. “look, he says the most irrational things. i don’t know what to say about it. but it doesn’t surprise me.”

on capitol hill, trump’s possible refusal to accept the election results has been discussed privately for weeks as lawmakers consider options. one senator said recently it was the biggest topic of private discussions.

two house democrats, reps. mikie sherrill of new jersey and elissa slotkin of michigan — both members of the armed services committee — are formally asking members of trump’s cabinet to go on record and commit to upholding the constitution and peaceful transition.

gen. mark milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, responded in a letter to the lawmakers last month that he sees “no role” for the military to intervene in a disputed election.

but defense secretary mark esper declined to respond to the lawmakers’ questions. similar queries have been sent to attorney general william barr and acting homeland security secretary chad wolf. they have yet to respond.

“the president can’t successfully refuse to accept the results of the election without a number of very senior officials aiding him,” said slotkin, a former cia analyst.

sherill, a former navy pilot, said peaceful transition “really relies a lot on the cabinet officers turning over their departments to the next administration.” she told the associated press recently she wants to hear from “all of them.”

meanwhile, republicans are rushing to fill the vacancy on the supreme court created by ruth bader ginsburg’s death, partly to ensure a trump-friendly court majority to resolve any post-election lawsuits by their party or trump himself.

texas sen. ted cruz is among leading republicans pushing the importance of the court’s role. and graham suggested on fox that the supreme court could end up all but declaring the winner.

democrats object strongly.

“he wants to be named president for life?” sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., exclaimed at the capitol. that’s how a “dictator” operates, she said. “that’s not how a democracy works.”

earlier thursday, the white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany sought to clarify trump’s words, saying he “will accept the results of a free and fair election.”

but the press secretary added that trump wants to “get rid of mass, mail-out voting.”

the president, who uses mail-in voting himself, has tried to distinguish between states that automatically send ballots to all registered voters and those, like florida, that send only to voters who request them. five states that routinely send mail ballots to all voters have seen no significant fraud.

of the nine states with universal ballots this year, only nevada is a battleground, and likely pivotal only in a total national presidential deadlock.

before the 2016 election, much as now, trump refused to commit to accepting the results during the summer.

“i have to see,” trump said two months ago on “fox news sunday.” “no, i’m not going to just say yes. i’m not going to say no, and i didn’t last time either.”

beijing (ap) — a chinese health official said friday that the country’s annual production capacity for coronavirus vaccines will top 1 billion doses next year, following an aggressive government support program for construction of new factories.

capacity is expected to reach 610 million doses by the end of this year, zheng zhongwei from the national health commission said.

“next year, our annual capacity will reach more than 1 billion doses,” he said at a news conference.

american pharmaceutical giants pfizer and moderna aim to produce a billion doses each in 2021 as well.

zheng said distribution of the vaccines would prioritize groups such as medical workers, border personnel and the elderly before they are made available to the general public.

china has promoted the construction of vaccine testing facilities and manufacturing plants, and assigned independent monitors for their assembly. china has 11 vaccine candidates in human trials, with four of them currently in the third and final trials.

one of those is coronavac, made by the private company sinovac, which is already rolling off the factory floor at a bio-secure facility outside beijing. sinovac’s chairman, yin weidong, said thursday that the factory was built in months, and more could be constructed if demand is sufficient.

some nations are pooling vaccine efforts to ensure success against the disease. more than 150 countries are setting up the covid-19 vaccines global access facility, or covax, under the world health organization.

their target is to make 2 billion doses to inoculate 20% of the world’s population.

the director-general of who, tedros ghebreyesus, said earlier this month that “the goal must be to vaccinate some people in all countries, rather than all the people in some countries.”

Feds air FBI agent’s gripes about Flynn probe,53,izktke,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/25/fbi-agents-michael-flynn-probe-421633,7,1601074238.0,,"the interview report says that while barnett viewed the investigative steps taken as “legally justified,” the so-called predication — or factual basis — for the probe into flynn was “not great.” barnett said his view of the overall trump-russia probe was that it was based on “supposition upon supposition.”

the official public release of such candid assessments from inside a federal investigative team is extraordinarily rare, although it is now becoming commonplace in connection with the flynn case.

in submitting the barnett interview to u.s. district court judge emmet sullivan, prosecutors indicated they believe barnett’s account buttresses the highly unusual and controversial decision attorney general william barr made in may to abandon the false-statement charge flynn pleaded guilty to in 2017 as a part of a plea deal with mueller’s office.

the release of barnett’s interview — conducted by doj attorneys on sept. 17 — suggests the department is still actively investigating the roots of the flynn probe in advance of a looming hearing on tuesday where sullivan is scheduled to hear arguments for and against the department’s motion to drop the case.

since both the government and flynn want the case dismissed, a former judge appointed by sullivan as a friend-of-the-court is scheduled to argue in favor of leaving flynn’s guilty plea in place and proceeding to sentence him on the charge.

in late 2017, flynn pleaded guilty to lying to fbi agents about his december 2016 calls with russia’s then-ambassador to the united states, sergey kislyak. after cooperating for over a year with mueller, who took over the fbi’s russia probe after trump fired bureau director james comey in may 2017, flynn reversed course and accused the fbi and justice department of egregious misconduct, seeking to rescind his guilty plea.

when barr essentially backed that effort in may, justice department veterans and capitol hill democrats decried the move as a politically motivated attempt by barr to protect an ally of the president and discredit a probe trump has long characterized as a “witch hunt” and a “coup.”

the interview summary itself is a series of contradictions. though barnett voices deep doubts about the motivations of some of his colleagues, he ultimately agreed that flynn lied to the fbi. he also indicated that he believed the other investigations led by the crossfire hurricane team were meritorious, though he says he often offered more benign theories about actions taken by trump and his team when other agents were inclined to view them in a more incriminating light.

barnett also said that flynn told mueller’s team during one session after his plea deal that trump may have been aware of his interactions with kislyak. barnett attributed that, however, to flynn telling agents what they wanted to hear and that he reversed himself when barnett pressed him for clarity.

“during one interview of flynn … one of the interviewers asked a series of questions including one in which flynn’s answer seemed to indicate trump was aware of [redacted] between flynn and the russian ambassador,” the summary reads. “barnett believed flynn’s answer was an effort to tell the interviewers what they wanted to hear. barnett had to ask the clarifying question of flynn who then said clearly that trump was not aware of [redacted.]”

barnett also indicated he wasn’t fully read in on all of the evidence or facts in the case and at one point sought to remove himself from it before he was convinced by colleagues like peter strzok, one of the lead fbi agents handling the case, to join mueller’s investigative team. in late 2016, barnett also repeatedly urged the fbi to conduct an interview with flynn, characterizing it as a formality and an “easy layup” before closing the investigation. his superiors resisted at the time though, with some worrying it might alert flynn to their investigation.

senior fbi agents conducted the interview of flynn on jan. 24, 2017 without advising barnett until it was over.

the barnett interview also provides a glimpse into tensions between agents and prosecutors on the mueller team. barnett says that when he initially briefed mueller prosecutor jeannie rhee on the flynn probe, she seemed deeply dubious about barnett’s view that there was little evidence that flynn was in the pocket of the russians.

“barnett thought rhee was obsessed with flynn and russia and she had an agenda,” the report says. “rhee told barnett she looked forward to working together. barnett told rhee they would not be working together.”

the interview of barnett was conducted by a team led by the prosecutor barr tapped to review the flynn case, u.s. attorney for the eastern district of missouri jeffrey jensen. it’s unclear why the interview took place just days before the flynn court hearing, which was delayed from may due to an unsuccessful effort by flynn and the justice department to head it off. another prosecutor, u.s. attorney for connecticut john durham, is conducting a broader inquiry into the overall trump-russia probe, including leaks and other potential misconduct.

earlier thursday, flynn’s team posted another set of documents from the justice department that contained hundreds of internal fbi messages between agents and other officials discussing the flynn case. the filing accompanying the messages alleges that they show agents raising grave doubts about the validity of the flynn investigation at various points.

flynn’s team alleges that one january 2017 message — an exchange in which two fbi officials suggest their colleagues were all obtaining liability insurance ahead of trump’s inauguration — indicated it was related to their fears about the handling of the flynn investigation. but barnett, in his interview, contradicted that claim, suggesting it was unlikely to be related to the flynn probe because it predated the public disclosure of the matter in new reports. barnett also said he regularly encourages colleagues to obtain professional liability insurance.

flynn’s legal team may also have misinterpreted another set of messages in which they say “fbi analysts discussed the preference of some agents for a clinton presidency.” a fuller set of messages included with the filing, however, makes clear that they referred to a suggestion that the russians — not fbi officials — might have preferred hillary clinton since she was a known entity, while trump presented more of a “wild card.”

in the fuller exchange, the agents debate the issue, with one replying, “i don’t know man, the hooks russia has into big t are pretty deep.”

the decision of flynn’s attorneys to file more of the documents they’ve obtained from prosecutors appears to conflict with an order judge sullivan issued in april that said flynn’s team should not file any more material provided by doj until the department announces it has completed a review of the flynn matter barr ordered earlier this year."

(ap photo/paul sancya, file)

orlando, fla. (ap) — a federal judge has stopped the 2020 census from finishing at month’s end and suspended a year-end deadline for delivering the numbers needed to decide how many seats each state gets in congress.

the preliminary injunction granted by u.s. district judge lucy koh in california late thursday allows the once-a-decade head count of every u.s. resident to continue through the end of october.

koh said the shortened schedule ordered by president donald trump’s administration likely would produce inaccurate results that would last a decade.

the judge sided with civil rights groups and local governments that sued the u.s. census bureau and the u.s. department of commerce, which oversees the statistical agency, arguing that minorities and others in hard-to-count communities would be missed if the counting ends this month.

in granting the preliminary injunction, the judge said the plaintiffs were likely to succeed at a trial. despite concerns raised by top census bureau officials about the shortened schedule, the trump administration failed to consider its duty to produce an accurate head count and neglected to adequately explain a reason for it, she said.

koh said inaccuracies produced from a shortened schedule would affect the distribution of federal funding and political representation over the next 10 years. the census is used to determine how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed each year and how many congressional seats each state gets.

before the coronavirus pandemic hit in march, around the same time the census started for most u.s. residents, the bureau had planned to complete the 2020 census by the end of july.

in april, in response to the pandemic, it extended the deadline to the end of october. then, in late july or early august, the deadline changed once again to the end of september after the republican-controlled senate failed to take up a request from the census bureau to extend the dec. 31 deadline for turning over the numbers used for deciding how many congressional seats each state gets.

attorneys for the census bureau had argued that the census must finish by the end of september to meet the dec. 31 deadline and have enough time for crunching the numbers used for deciding how many congressional seats each state gets, in a process known as apportionment. but koh said that argument “runs counter to the facts.”

“those facts show not only that the bureau could not meet the statutory deadline, but also that the bureau had received pressure from the commerce department to cease seeking an extension of the deadline,” she wrote.

koh’s preliminary injunction suspended that end-of-the-year deadline, giving census bureau statisticians time to crunch the numbers for apportionment from the start of november until the end of next april, for the time being.

previously, the census bureau had only half that time for data processing, from the start of october until the end of december.

the san jose, california-based judge earlier this month issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the census bureau from winding down field operations until she ruled.

attorneys for the census bureau and the department of commerce said friday they would file an appeal and asked the judge to suspend the injunction while that happens.

“were the bureau to miss these deadlines, congress could well decide to disregard the 2020 census results in conducting apportionment, as it previously did for the 1920 census,” the attorneys for the federal government said in court papers.

the civil rights groups and local governments alleged that the decision to shorten the schedule was made to accommodate a directive from trump that tried to exclude people in the country illegally from the apportionment numbers. a three-judge panel in new york blocked trump’s directive, saying it was unlawful. the trump administration is appealing to the supreme court.

commerce secretary wilbur ross directed the census bureau to come up with a shortened plan, despite concerns raised by top bureau leaders who worried in internal communications that cutting a month off would produce a count with “fatal data quality flaws,” koh’s order said.

the bureau was facing a shortfall in census takers after large numbers reported for training but then dropped out.

an email from tim olson, associate director for field operations, to his colleagues called it “ludicrous” to believe a full count could be completed before oct. 31 and that anyone thinking the apportionment numbers would be turned in by dec. 31 “has either a mental deficiency or a political motivation.”

koh’s decision ensures that hard-to-count communities won’t be overlooked and produce an incomplete count, said attorneys for the plaintiffs after the ruling.

“as the court recognized, the census bureau has itself repeatedly recognized that a full, fair, and accurate count takes time, especially when faced with a historic pandemic,” said melissa sherry, the lead plaintiff’s attorney. “every day that the 2020 census count continues, and census operations appropriately continue, will help ensure the accuracy and completeness of this once-in-a-decade tally.”

Democrats to Propose Bill Limiting Supreme Court Justice Terms to 18 Years,53,izmzt3,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/democrats-to-propose-bill-limiting-supreme-court-justice-terms-to-18-years/,16,1601081134.0,,"the flag-draped casket of justice ruth bader ginsburg lies in repose under the portico at the top of the front steps of the u.s. supreme court building in washington, d.c., september 24, 2020. (alex brandon/reuters)

house democrats are planning to introduce a bill next week that would limit the terms of supreme court justices to 18 years instead of their current lifetime tenure, just as president trump prepares to announce a nominee to fill the late justice ruth bader ginsburg’s seat.

the bill, the supreme court term limits and regular appointments act, was spearheaded by lead sponsor representative ro khanna, a california democrat, who is expected to introduce the bill next week, along with cosponsors representatives joe kennedy iii and don beyer.

“it would save the country a lot of agony and help lower the temperature over fights for the court that go to the fault lines of cultural issues and is one of the primary things tearing at our social fabric,” khanna said in a statement.

he added in a tweet that, “every president should have an equal chance to appoint justices. our entire democratic system shouldn’t hinge on the shoulders of individual supreme court justices.”

the bill would also cap the number of justices a president could nominate to two per term. it would also not apply to current supreme court justices.

the constitution states that justices “shall hold their offices during good behaviour.” the democratic legislation, details of which are expected to be revealed on friday, would attempt to comply with the constitution by relegating justices to lower courts after 18 years on the supreme court.

ginsburg died last week on friday at 87 after a battle with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

her death has upended the election season as democrats prepare to oppose trump’s nominee to take ginsburg’s place, saying the president should refrain from nominating a new justice during an election year. the upcoming nominee would be trump’s third after justices brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch were confirmed to the court. the president has promised to name a woman, and judge amy coney barrett is considered the frontrunner to be tapped.

Breonna Taylor case: Video shows police moments after officer was shot during raid,2,izp6yc,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/breonna-taylor-case-video-shows-police-moments-after-officer-was-n1241073,5,1601087942.0,[deleted],"newly released body-camera video from the police raid at breonna taylor's apartment that led to her killing shows the moments after one of the officers was shot in the leg.

the 44-second video was released on twitter on thursday night by the attorney for police sgt. jonathan mattingly.

""this is the raw video of louisville officer sgt. john mattingly shortly after kenneth walker shot him,"" lawyer todd mcmurtry said in the tweet. ""they called him a 'murderer,' when all he did was defend himself.""

in the footage, mattingly is seen on the ground after he was shot.

""put him in the car,"" an officer is heard saying in the video. officers then carry mattingly and put him on the trunk of a car.

""cover him. let's go,"" the officer is heard saying. ""cover me.""

a spokesperson for the louisville metro police department said in a statement that it was aware of the video.

""that video shows sgt. mattingly receiving medical attention after he was shot. we do not know who leaked that video. we are not going to comment on the content of the video due to our ongoing internal review of what happened that night,"" the spokesperson said.

mcmurtry told nbc news on friday that he obtained the video from his client and released it because he thinks it's ""important for people to understand what happened to jon mattingly.”

he said he is representing mattingly in regard to ""claims for defamation and slander related to people calling him a murderer.""

the posting of the video comes two days after a grand jury declined to charge any officers in taylor's killing during the march 13 raid. only one officer was indicted, former detective brett hankison, on charges of first-degree wanton endangerment for gunshots that hit a neighboring apartment.

police had a no-knock warrant for the raid at the home of taylor, 26, an emergency medical technician. the officers, who broke down taylor's door, were seeking evidence in a narcotics investigation. the target of the probe did not live at the location.

breonna taylor was a qualified emt family photo via nbc12

walker, taylor's boyfriend, fired a shot at the front door, striking mattingly, according to police. walker, who had a license to carry firearms, has said he believed it was a home invasion.

police and one witness have said that officers announced themselves before entering the apartment, according to state attorney general daniel cameron. walker has said he and taylor never heard anyone say ""police.""

attorney kent wicker, who represented mattingly in the taylor criminal case, declined to comment on the video.

the louisville metro police department and the attorney general could not immediately be reached friday.

the police department has previously said that the shooting was not captured on video because some officers with the criminal interdiction division, which executed the search warrant at taylor's home, do not wear body cameras.

cameron made similar comments wednesday when he said that there is no video of the officers attempting to execute the warrant.

""the video footage begins at the point that area patrol officers arrive at the location,"" he said. ""therefore, the sequence of events from march 13 had to be pieced together through evidence — 911 calls, police radio traffic, and interviews."""

Sources: Trump intends to choose Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme Court,43,izt4sk,https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/25/politics/donald-trump-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court/index.html,26,1601100311.0,[deleted],"(cnn) president donald trump intends to choose amy coney barrett to be the new supreme court justice, according to multiple senior republican sources with knowledge of the process.

in conversations with some senior republican allies on the hill, the white house is indicating that barrett, a federal appellate judge and notre dame law professor, is the intended nominee, multiple sources said.

all sources cautioned that until it is announced by the president, there is always the possibility that trump makes a last-minute change but the expectation is barrett is the choice. he is scheduled to make the announcement on saturday afternoon.

a former law clerk to the late right-wing beacon justice antonin scalia, barrett would tilt the balance of power on the court further to the right, possibly ahead of a consequential case on health care to be argued the week after election day . if her senate confirmation is successful before the november election, the appointment would mark trump's third supreme court pick in one presidential term, cementing a conservative stronghold in the court for a generation.

she has been the leading choice throughout the week, since justice ruth bader ginsburg died. she is the only potential nominee known to have met with the president in person, according to two of the sources. the president did not formally interview any other candidates for the supreme court justice vacancy aside from barrett, according to a person familiar with the matter, despite saying monday he'd spoken with a few candidates."
"When Biden calls a 'lid,' Democrats wet the bed — and Trump starts mocking",0,izul0p,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/25/biden-campaign-lid-trump-421824,4,1601105279.0,,"trump made a similar crack at biden's expense tuesday in moon township, pa. he gleefully repeated the single-syllable word, to the genuine delight of his campaign aides, who now consider it their favorite new bit from his rallies. in both cities this week, and again friday, trump compared his recent barnstorming to biden’s days at home preparing for events, raising money via virtual events and recuperating.

“i’m working my ass off,” said trump, whose own weekend golf outings and tv obsession are mocked endlessly by liberals. “i'm in ohio. i'm in texas. i'm in florida. i’m in michigan. i'm in wisconsin.""

friday offered yet more contrast. biden, who's been preparing for next week’s debate, flew to washington to pay his last respects to justice ruth bader ginsburg, then formally settled down at home just as the lunch hour ended. trump’s day had him stopping in doral, fla.; atlanta, ga.; and newport news, va. — a schedule fox business hailed as “remarkable” in a characteristically flattering chyron.

trump is keeping close watch on biden's movements. in atlanta, he noted biden had returned home, again.

""hey champ, if i lose to a guy — that’s like you losing to a fighter that, you know, hasn’t worked out in the last six months. this guy never goes out! it’s terrible, huh?"" trump asked, reviving his ""low-energy"" critiques of biden. ""you better make sure i win. i’m gonna be very embarrassed, i lost to a guy that didn’t campaign!""

the gambit: to hear the biden campaign tell it, his travel schedule doesn’t matter. aides say the criticism leveled by trump concerning biden’s events and his calling “lids” is more interesting to restive or bored social media addicts than to the public at large.

to biden’s camp, it’s a continuation of the discredited criticism that the shelter-in-place phase of biden’s campaign would hurt him and help trump after the pandemic first hit. (trump needled him endlessly for being ""sleepy"" and staying in his basement, but biden’s team has chuckled as he maintained his polling lead). a biden adviser said it’s fine to let trump hold big, dangerous rallies during a pandemic. anyway, trump's aversion to telling the truth has taken all the sting out of the attacks, biden's staff asserts.

“this is a referendum on trump, and we’re not playing his game. you shouldn’t, either,” the biden adviser instructed. “real people don’t care about biden’s travel. fox [news] does. this is not what people are talking about. look at the polling: it’s littered with hot takes about biden that have been proven stone-cold wrong time and again.”

it's true, the public isn’t exactly pining for in-person events. forty percent of voters— and 51 percent of democrats — told the politico/morning consult poll this week that they don’t think candidates should be on the road at all because of the coronavirus.

there’s also merit to the observation about media. while fox news has echoed trump’s critiques, the rest of the networks have spent far more time on the virus that has sickened 7 million americans and killed more than 203,000 — as well as trump’s repeated refusals to commit to a peaceful transition of power should he lose in november.

if biden’s campaign was sensitive about their early lids, there are workarounds. he could go out for a quick lunch, or afternoon ice cream cone, and chit-chat with voters as the press pool follows. he could keep his travel options open, and not call a lid until later in the day.

biden addressed trump's ""sleepy"" hits on wral-tv this week in north carolina. ""watch me. look at him,” biden said, pointing to trump's verbal miscues, questionable medical advice and apparent struggles to navigate a ramp earlier this year. ""i’m not the guy who says 'inject bleach in your arm.' i do know the difference between truth and lies, between good and bad, between hope and fear. just watch me. and make your decision.""

a top democratic pollster agreed with biden’s campaign, but with a more brutal assessment of the candidate. the person pointed to his penchant for gaffes and rambling stories as part of the strategy for keeping biden bottled up.

“the fact is a cardboard cutout could beat trump. but biden could lose to him,” the pollster said. “there’s no win in biden being out on the trail the way trump wants. the biden campaign has been smart about that.”

the longer view: biden is hardly a shut-in. he called a lid at 9:03 p.m. wednesday; 10:23 p.m. monday and 10:09 p.m. last friday, after swings through north carolina, wisconsin and minnesota. the former vice president finished at 3:40 p.m. sunday, after appearing in philadelphia for a speech on the death of ginsburg and the future of the supreme court.

yet he’s built in considerable down stretches. sundays, there’s church and usually little more. biden has yet to overnight outside his home. and since mid-august, he’s had at least 20 days without holding a traditional campaign event, though the tally of his public schedules doesn’t account for virtual fundraisers or private strategy sessions with aides.

trump stayed overnight during a recent west coast jaunt through arizona, nevada and california. while he made a similar overnight trip to arizona and nevada ahead of the 2018 midterm election, trump also prefers to return home for the night after campaign rallies, and did so often during his first run for president in 2016.

so, it's tempting, if not fashionable, to acquiesce to the “nothing matters” point of view given the steadiness of the race and trump’s failures to break through. biden’s strategy of standing aside and letting trump light himself on fire has been successful. why change it now?

but some democrats have grown nervous about the lack of an on-ground presence and, in the case of states like florida, biden's softening voter-registration numbers.

in the end, they’re hoping the polls are right in nearly every battleground state and that antipathy for trump is so strong it inspires enough turnout to compensate for the relative lack of enthusiasm biden’s base might have for its candidate."
Fox News won a court case by 'persuasively' arguing that no 'reasonable viewer' takes Tucker Carlson seriously,642,j04eqv,https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-karen-mcdougal-case-tucker-carlson-2020-9?r=US&IR=T,77,1601148412.0,,"a federal judge on thursday dismissed a lawsuit against fox news after lawyers for the network argued that no ""reasonable viewer"" would take the network's primetime star tucker carlson seriously.

the former playboy model karen mcdougal filed a defamation suit against fox alleging that carlson slandered her during a december 2018 episode of his show, ""tucker carlson tonight.""

the network asked a judge to dismiss the case, arguing that ""carlson's statements were not statements of fact and that she failed adequately to allege actual malice.""

the judge agreed with fox's premise, adding that the network ""persuasively argues"" that ""given mr. carlson's reputation, any reasonable viewer 'arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticism' about the statements he makes.""

a federal judge on thursday dismissed a lawsuit against fox news after lawyers for the network argued that no ""reasonable viewer"" takes the primetime host tucker carlson seriously, a new court filing said.

the case was brought by the former playboy model karen mcdougal, who said carlson defamed her on his show, ""tucker carlson tonight,"" by saying she extorted president donald trump ""out of approximately $150,000 in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair,"" the filing said.

fox news asked the judge to toss out mcdougal's case by arguing that ""carlson's statements were not statements of fact and that she failed adequately to allege actual malice.""

mcdougal said two of carlson's statements during the episode on december 10, 2018, were defamatory:

carlson's claim that mcdougal ""approached donald trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if he doesn't give them money.""

carlson's claim that mcdougal's actions amounted to ""a classic case of extortion.""

but fox news argued that carlson ""cannot be understood to have been stating facts, but instead that he was delivering an opinion using hyperbole for effect,"" the ruling said.

it added that fox news ""submits that the use of that word or an accusation of extortion, absent more, is simply 'loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language' that does not give rise to a defamation claim.""

us district judge mary kay vyskocil agreed with fox's premise, adding that the network ""persuasively argues"" that ""given mr. carlson's reputation, any reasonable viewer 'arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticism' about the statements he makes.""

""this 'general tenor' of the show should then inform a viewer that he is not 'stating actual facts' about the topics he discusses and is instead engaging in 'exaggeration' and 'non-literal commentary,'"" the ruling said.

mcdougal made headlines in 2018 when it surfaced that michael cohen, trump's longtime lawyer and fixer, had arranged for american media inc., the owner of the tabloid the national enquirer, to pay her $150,000 for her story that she had an affair with trump in 2006. ami purchased but never published mcdougal's story to shield trump in the weeks before the 2016 election, a practice known as ""catch and kill.""

carlson has made several racist and controversial statements during his tenure as one of fox news' primetime stars.

last year, after a mass shooting in el paso, texas, in which the suspect wrote a manifesto about a ""hispanic invasion of texas,"" carlson argued that white supremacy was a ""hoax"" and ""not a real problem.""

in december 2018, carlson claimed that immigrants would make the us ""poorer and dirtier."" nearly three dozen advertisers then cut ties with carlson's show.

three months later, the host again found himself in hot water when tapes surfaced featuring him describing women as ""primitive"" and saying they ""just need to be quiet,"" comparing them to dogs, and defending the convicted pedophile warren jeffs. carlson refused to apologize and invited those who disagreed with him to appear on his show.

in june, as protests erupted across the us following the police killing of george floyd, the host said the demonstrations were ""definitely not about black lives"" and told viewers to ""remember that when they come for you.""

carlson saw another exodus of advertisers following his remarks about the protests.

""karen mcdougal's lawsuit attempted to silence spirited opinion commentary on matters of public concern,"" fox news media said in a statement after thursday's ruling. ""the court today held that the first amendment plainly prohibits such efforts to stifle free speech. the decision is a victory not just for fox news media, but for all defenders of the first amendment."""
Special Report: Will your mail ballot count in the U.S. presidential election? It may depend on who's counting and where,20,j06hcq,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-absentee-ballots/special-report-will-your-mail-ballot-count-in-the-us-presidential-election-it-may-depend-on-whos-counting-and-where-idUSKCN26G1HP,6,1601157488.0,,"(reuters) - two elderly women in small towns in wisconsin voted by mail during april’s presidential nominating contests. both were sheltering in place as coronavirus surged across their state.

file photo: poll workers prepare absentee ballots for shipment at the wake county board of elections on the first day that the state started mailing them out, in raleigh, north carolina, u.s. september 4, 2020. reuters/jonathan drake

each mailed her ballot to the local election office with a note explaining why no witness had signed the envelope, as wisconsin’s strict voting laws require. the women didn’t want to risk virus exposure, they told reuters in telephone interviews this month.

that’s where the similarity ends. the ballot of peggy houglum, a 72-year-old voter in the eastern wisconsin hamlet of cedar grove, was rejected due to the missing witness information. that of judith olson, 88, a resident of the northern town of elk, was accepted, according to “incident” logs viewed by reuters in which wisconsin election offices document irregular ballots. houglum, who plans to vote for democratic presidential candidate joe biden in november, said she was never told her ballot didn’t count. olson wouldn’t provide her party affiliation or say whom she supports for president.

local election officials confirmed the fate of those ballots. cedar grove village clerk julie brey told reuters she had sought guidance from the wisconsin elections commission on what to do. her elk counterpart, suzanne brandt, said she couldn’t recall who advised her to accept an unwitnessed ballot.

the unequal treatment in the same crucial battleground state underscores a growing worry about the general election on nov. 3 between biden and incumbent republican president donald trump. whether or not a mail ballot is counted could depend to a large degree on how local election workers enforce mail-in voting rules, how they notify voters who submit deficient ballots, and whether they allow them to fix such errors. each of the 50 u.s. states has a central election authority, but ballots are processed by dozens of separate county or municipal election offices within each state.

reuters reviewed incident logs and other election records from wisconsin’s april race. the news organization also examined data from election offices in north carolina, florida and arizona containing the number of mail-in ballots rejected in recent elections in those presidential battlegrounds. reuters also surveyed 36 election officials across the four states about how they processed mail-in ballots, notified voters who mailed deficient ballots, and enabled those voters to cast valid votes.

the records detailed more than 3 million mail ballots cast during the four states’ presidential nomination contests this year. the vast majority of those were accepted, but at least 25,000 mail-in ballots were rejected for violations of signature and witness requirements. reuters could not follow up with all individuals whose ballots were rejected. still, some trends emerged from the statewide data and interviews with dozens of voters and election officials.

reuters found:

- minorities, who tend to vote democratic, are more likely than white voters to have their mail-in ballots rejected for signature and witness issues in north carolina and florida. voter race data was unavailable in arizona and wisconsin.

- procedures for handling deficient mail ballots differed, sometimes markedly, between election offices within each state; and election officials told reuters of varying timetables and methods for notifying voters. ballot designs also diverged, with signature boxes clearer on some than others.

- geography and population size helped determine how easily election officials could contact voters about ballot deficiencies. officials in small, compact jurisdictions tended to say they found it easier to notify voters than did their counterparts in larger communities, because they were more likely to know voters personally.

‘voting without a safety net’

u.s. mail-in voting surged in states that held presidential primaries after mid-march, when the covid-19 pandemic exploded. millions of americans are projected to cast mail ballots for the first time this november, with coronavirus expected to drive record-high absentee turnout.

slowed u.s. postal service deliveries this summer raised alarms about ballots arriving too late to be counted. but voters may not be aware of other potential pitfalls.

the uneven application of mail-in voting rules illegally disadvantages some voters, according to voting-rights advocates, who have sued to standardize the way local officials process absentee ballots, notify voters about errors and allow voters to fix them in the four states that reuters examined. one lawsuit failed in september to eliminate wisconsin’s witness requirement. another successfully extended the period for arizona voters to add signatures to unsigned ballots. activists won settlements in two additional cases, one in florida, the other in north carolina, though they say those states have yet to comply fully.

for millions of u.s. voters, voting-rights advocates say, the odds of their mail-in ballot counting this november could come down to where they are registered to vote and how workers in their local election office implement their state’s voting rules.

“mail-in voting is voting without a safety net,” because voters are not present to resolve any issues that arise with their mail ballots, said david becker, head of the nonpartisan center for election innovation & research. that underscores why statewide rules “shouldn’t be applied differently county to county,” he said.

jason snead, executive director at the conservative honest elections project, said election officials should apply absentee ballot requirements as uniformly as possible. still he said “absolute uniformity” goes against the u.s. tradition of running elections locally to provide “flexibility, responsiveness and direct accountability to voters.” he said voters need to know they must “follow every rule that is written out on that ballot, make sure that they’ve crossed every t, dotted every i.”

the stakes are high.

trump won the white house in 2016 by a whisker. he lost the popular vote, but fewer than 80,000 votes in three crucial states, including wisconsin, handed him an electoral college victory over democrat hillary clinton. recent polls slightly favor biden in wisconsin, but he and trump are neck-and-neck in florida, arizona and north carolina.

the number of rejected mail ballots is almost certain to be higher in november than it was in this year’s primaries because of higher expected turnout, election experts said.

in north carolina, for example, about 1% of voters cast mail ballots in the march 3 primary, before coronavirus swept the nation. that figure could soar close to 25% in november, according to a reuters/ipsos poll of likely voters conducted earlier this month. about a third of voters in florida expect to vote by mail, as do about two in five voters in wisconsin and more than half in arizona, other reuters/ipsos polls showed this month.

if officials in north carolina and florida alone toss out ballots in november at the rates they did in march, more than 75,000 voters could be disenfranchised, reuters calculates. that figure assumes turnout matches 2016 levels, and that voters end up casting mail ballots at the levels they said they would in the polls.

tale of two ballots

in the four battleground states, reuters found examples of 24 voters whose ballots were rejected without their knowledge, because local authorities used different mail-in ballot counting processes or notification procedures than other localities in the same state. election officials in almost every case claimed they had attempted to notify voters who cast deficient ballots and informed them how to cast a valid vote.

wisconsin and north carolina are among 11 u.s. states that require absentee ballot envelopes to be signed by a witness.

more than half of the 23,000 absentee ballots rejected in wisconsin’s april 7 primary were thrown out for lacking a voter signature, witness information or both, according to state data. on april 2, a federal district judge in wisconsin relaxed the witness requirement due to the pandemic. that ruling was overturned by the 7th circuit court of appeals the next day.

election officials statewide applied the witness requirement in myriad ways, according to a reuters analysis of incident logs and other public records from municipalities comprising about 80% of wisconsin’s electorate.

in the eastern wisconsin village of waldo, home to around 500 people, clerk-treasurer michelle brecht noticed a dozen voters had omitted witness information on their mail ballots; witnesses must provide a signature and an address. because brecht knew almost everyone in town, she told reuters, she contacted all affected voters and was able to help them fix their ballots.

in the western wisconsin town of pepin, meanwhile, ballots lacking voter signatures and witness information were among 143 mail votes counted, according to county board of canvassers’ minutes from the april primary. the minutes did not say how many mail ballots were deficient, but the board recommended “more training for election workers in the area of absentee ballot processing.”

nancy wolfe, town clerk of pepin, whose population is a little more than 800 residents, said her staff had received additional training. she did not respond when asked specifically about the board’s claim that deficient absentee ballots were accepted in the april primary.

some inconsistencies likely arose from confusion over the last-minute court rulings, according to jay heck, state director for common cause wisconsin, a government watchdog group. the appeals court reversed the district court’s lifting of the witness requirement just days before the election, he noted, leaving election officials disoriented. heck also pointed to wisconsin’s “unusually decentralized” election administration system, in which 1,850 separate municipalities handle voter registration and absentee ballots.

north carolina’s witness requirement is even stricter: absentee voters had to find two witnesses for the march 3 primary. that tripped up retiree william hearn. he told reuters he only got one witness to sign his ballot envelope. (for the november presidential contest, north carolina is allowing voters to secure a single witness.)

hearn, 72, was one of at least 121 voters in durham county and nearly 1,800 statewide who had mail-in ballots rejected for missing signature or witness information, according to a reuters analysis of state election data.

derek bowens, director of the elections board of durham county, which contains north carolina’s fourth-largest city, durham, said his office mailed a replacement ballot with a letter of explanation to hearn on february 27, one day after receiving his incomplete ballot.

hearn said he never received it and had no idea his original ballot had been rejected until notified in september by reuters. “i have a very big problem with that,” hearn said. a biden supporter, he now fears his mail ballot could be rejected in november without his knowledge.

an hour south in harnett county, republican david krachun, 57, forgot to sign his ballot in the march primary. in contrast to durham, harnett county voters who cast deficient ballots were notified twice by mail and as many times as necessary by phone, according to county elections director claire jones.

of the 25 voters who had mail ballots rejected in harnett county, which is largely republican, seven eventually cast a ballot that counted, according to jones; they included krachun, who mailed in a second absentee ballot that was accepted. harnett county’s 28% “cure” rate was close to three times that of durham county, a democratic stronghold.

racial disparities

krachun is white, while hearn, whose ballot was rejected, is black.

during the march election in north carolina, about 5% of all voters who returned mail ballots had them rejected for signature or witness issues and ended up not casting a vote that counted, state election records show. broken down by race, about 8% of black voters didn’t wind up casting a valid vote after their mail ballots were tossed compared to about 5% of white voters. election officials interviewed by reuters had no explanation for the disparity.

florida counties also reject mail-in ballots at widely varying rates, and they reject black and hispanic voters at higher rates than white voters, according to university of florida professor daniel smith.

smith examined mail-in ballots in march’s presidential primary that were recorded as being delivered by election day. out of those voters, 1.1% of hispanics and 0.8% of blacks had their ballots rejected, smith found, compared with just 0.4% of whites.

officials in six florida counties where minorities were rejected at significantly higher rates than white voters said their offices applied the rules consistently and that racial and ethnic disparities must be due to factors outside their control.

“it’s definitely not something purposely being done,” said kari ewalt, community relations manager for the supervisor of elections in osceola county. smith found that hispanic voters there were more than twice as likely as white voters to have their ballots rejected.

one possible explanation is that many minority voters have little experience with mail voting. but smith found that even accounting for that, black and hispanic voters were more likely to have their ballots rejected. the variation across florida counties suggested “it can’t just be the individual’s fault,” smith said.

disparities could arise from officials in some election offices being stricter when scrutinizing a voter’s signature, smith said. the design of the ballot return envelope, and how quickly officials process ballots and flag problems to voters, are also potential factors, he said.

no standard process

local election officials in all four states have considerable leeway in how they process mail-in ballots and respond to errors.

in florida, officials must contact voters whose ballots lack signatures and offer them a chance to confirm their identities with an affidavit, which can be returned up to two days after the polls close. but there is no set prescription for how to do that. some election offices first try to call the voter, others first put the affidavit in the mail. others said they primarily use email.

in north carolina, a reuters survey of 20 counties revealed similar differences. in rural lee county, karen marosites, deputy director of elections, said it sometimes took eight days to notify a voter of a deficient mail-in ballot.

in response to a lawsuit brought by groups including the southern coalition for social justice, a civil rights organization, a federal judge in north carolina in august ordered the state elections board to publish statewide guidance that would bring the state’s 100 counties into alignment.

coalition attorneys said the resulting guidance, released september 22, was an improvement but still lacked clarity on how counties would help voters cure deficient ballots. the north carolina elections board did not respond to requests for comment.

in wisconsin, a federal district judge in september upheld wisconsin’s witness requirement after the democratic national committee sued to remove it due to the pandemic.

in arizona, another lawsuit filed by the democratic party this year prompted the state’s 15 counties to standardize how mail-in voters could fix signature issues, giving them five business days after election day to cure unsigned ballots and mismatched signatures. but officials still have significant leeway in contacting voters.

pima county, arizona’s second-largest, mails replacement ballots only to voters whose unsigned ballots arrive more than a week before election day. rural apache county, meanwhile, notifies such voters via phone, email and u.s. mail, and follows up at least twice with phone and email if needed -- in addition to sending back the unsigned ballot if there is enough time for voters to sign and return it. “we have had people call us mad that we are ‘spamming’ them,” said apache county chief deputy recorder bowen udall.

alex gulotta, the arizona state director of all voting is local, a voting-rights group, said such differences can determine whether votes count - or not.

“there shouldn’t even be a possibility for that much variance to exist between the counties,” gulotta said."

on friday, local officials in luzerne county said in a statement that a ""temporary seasonal independent contractor"" had ""incorrectly discarded (the ballots) into the office trash.""

trump has repeatedly in the past claimed that the election would be rigged or made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. trump has used this incident to falsely allege widespread voter fraud, despite no evidence of such, which trump's appointed fbi director confirmed this week.

""now, we have not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise,"" fbi director christopher wray told the senate homeland security committee on thursday.

the doj statement about the pennsylvania incident did not use the phrase ""voter fraud."" but trump has been using the incident to drive a false narrative about voting. this tactic is not new for trump. in 2016, rather than attack mail-in ballots, he falsely claimed that illegal votes were being cast, of which his own commission found no evidence.

""they throw them out if they have the name trump on it, i guess,"" trump said on thursday, according to cnn.

while trump and his administration have used this incident to tout a fraud narrative, officials in pennsylvania said the incident was an ""error"" — not intentional fraud — that was quickly noticed and is being investigated. investigators told cnn they believe it was due to a lack of training, and the investigation is ongoing.

cnn reported that attorney general william barr briefed trump about the incident prior to trump's public comments attacking mail-in-voting. legal experts were concerned that barr was using the justice department to try and give credence to trump's baseless attacks on mail-in ballots."
‘It’s like every red flag’: Trump-ordered HHS ad blitz raises alarms,5,j099m5,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/25/trump-hhs-ads-coronavirus-421957,4,1601167186.0,,"the $15 million contract, which has not been previously reported, was officially awarded to atlas research on aug. 26. an fda spokesperson said that the funding for the contract was provided by hhs and the contract is being overseen by hhs.

as part of the contract, hhs recommended that atlas use a subcontractor firm called dd&t, according to spokespeople for atlas and the federal government.

hhs identified dd&t ""as a potential organization with the qualifications required by the government,"" weber said, declining to specify who at hhs chose the subcontractor.

dd&t is also a firm run by caputo's longtime business partner, den tolmor, who has now spent weeks working to produce the government's videos, said five people with knowledge of the arrangement. tolmor was caputo's client as recently as april 2020, compensating caputo at least $5,000 per year to handle his public relations, according to a copy of caputo's ethics disclosure form obtained by politico. the two men also went into business together to launch a video streaming platform and other services in 2017 and 2018.

two hhs officials said that caputo had spent weeks extolling tolmor's work, arguing that the russian-born filmmaker — who had been nominated for an oscar, but had no prior experience producing u.s. public health campaigns — would bring a fresh eye to the work and could execute caputo's vision.

asked whether hhs knew that caputo had a longstanding business relationship with tolmor, weber said he was unaware of the two men's prior work.

jeffrey souder, who does not work for hhs but has held multiple roles for caputo's private public relations firms, also has been included in the campaign planning efforts, said three individuals with knowledge of the planning process.

tolmor and souder did not respond to requests for comment. caputo referred questions to hhs.

hhs did not respond to questions about caputo's role in selecting his allies as subcontractors, but said that he had ""nothing to do"" with the selection of atlas research as the prime contractor.

fda's public affairs office did not respond to questions about who at the agency oversaw the selection process that chose atlas research, referring questions to hhs.

but three fda officials involved in the agency's response to coronavirus said they were previously unaware that caputo's team had used the fda to help manage its new advertising campaign.

""you're breaking news to me,"" said one official.

tapping celebrities

the campaign is still recording the public-service announcements, which could be aired as short snippets or longer conversations, said four people with knowledge of its strategy. trump administration officials also have sought out celebrities who have said favorable things about the president or are anticipated to provide friendly conversations for administration officials.

in one video recorded this month, infectious-disease expert tony fauci was paired for a conversation with dennis quaid, the star of “the big easy” and the upcoming “reagan,” among many other films, who had publicly praised trump's handling of coronavirus earlier this year. meanwhile, surgeon general jerome adams last friday was matched up with gospel singer winans, who has dealt with several family members, including her well-known brother bebe winans, falling ill from covid-19.

“[a]t the request of hhs, dr. fauci did an interview with dennis quaid for a psa campaign,” said a spokesperson for his agency, the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. the spokesperson said the agency was not privy to further details and referred questions to hhs.

a representative for adams did not respond to request for comment.

caputo’s team also has considered involving well-known figures like dr. oz and other members of the president's council on sports, fitness & nutrition, an advisory board of athletes and celebrities that is overseen by hhs, said three individuals with knowledge of the planning. one official said that oz would be a particularly good fit in the campaign because of his medical credentials and previous conversations with trump and senior appointees.

public health experts have critiqued oz’s praise for hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that trump favored to fight coronavirus despite scant evidence, and some of the tv doctor’s other pronouncements about handling the outbreak that they say are not grounded in science.

a spokesperson for oz did not respond to questions about whether the tv host had discussed a role in the administration’s covid-19 campaign, but on friday said that oz “is not scheduled to participate at this time.”

officials also have discussed the participation of musician garth brooks, whose daughter tested positive for coronavirus this summer, for a potential role in the advertising campaign, said two people with knowledge of the plan. representatives for brooks did not respond to request for comment.

brooks was invited to perform at trump’s 2017 presidential inauguration but declined the request, saying that he had a conflict with his touring schedule.

health officials have approached deploying the videos ""like a political campaign with surrogates"" tailored to winning over specific populations, said one individual who's spoken with caputo. for instance, caputo discussed deploying videos of winans in conversation with adams in urban markets, to shore up the administration's messaging with blacks. both winans and adams are african-american.

a representative for winans confirmed her involvement in the videos, praising adams for his part in the conversation.

""she volunteered her time participating in the psa and was happy to do so because of her concerns about how covid has and is impacting the african american community,"" chaz corzine, a spokesperson for winans, wrote in an email to politico.

representatives for quaid did not respond to requests for comment.

the health department defended the decisions to enlist celebrities, with a spokesperson saying that ""the entertainment industry and the news media can have a major influence on people’s beliefs and behaviors.""

weber, the hhs spokesperson, said in a statement that ""working in partnership with entertainers is one tactic being pursued to reach targeted audiences with public health messaging.""

but some current and former hhs officials said they were concerned that the ads would feature political appointees like adams, who was a top health official for then-indiana gov. mike pence before being tapped by trump to be u.s. surgeon general in 2017.

""the idea that you’d have administration officials in an ad that airs before the election strikes me as odd,"" said peck, who managed the advertising for healthcare.gov.

peck also dismissed a question about whether his team attempted to put then-president barack obama or other officials in government-funded tv advertising for that president's signature health care website.

""we never tried,"" he said.

shunning the experts

even as the health department barrels forward with cutting ads, the campaign has eschewed a potential major partner: the ad council, the communications industry's not-for-profit consortium that has spent decades partnering with the government on campaigns to fight public health problems like aids, opioids and obesity.

the council often spends weeks or months strategizing to coordinate public service announcements across multiple industries and not-for-profit partners, said current and former hhs officials who have worked with the group.

while the ad council earlier this year worked with the federal government and cdc specifically to promote the brand-new coronavirus.gov website, a representative told politico that the council is ""not playing any role"" with the current caputo-conceived campaign.

the health department’s failure to enlist potential partners — while trying to execute on a sweeping advertising plan — has boggled officials who worked on public service campaigns during the clinton, bush or obama administrations.

“i don’t know how you spend this money by the end of the year,” said a former hhs official. “i don’t know of any other campaign that hhs has ever run that’s ever come close to that.”

officials said that the strategy reflects the approach adopted by caputo, who relied on a small group of loyalists to handle what he perceived as a sensitive, high-priority project. but while caputo placed a half-dozen allies in roles across the health department, his outsized influence has started to ebb after beginning his medical leave on last wednesday.

hhs last week dismissed paul alexander, a friend of caputo who had been serving as his personal scientific adviser, a newly created position. hhs officials told politico that the position was unnecessary, given the vast scientific expertise already available in the health department. in the days leading up to his departure, alexander had sought to muzzle fauci from seeking publicly about the risks of coronavirus to children and change the content of the cdc's morbidity and mortality weekly reports.

meanwhile, a health department twitter account, @spoxhhs, that caputo took over this spring and used to battle with reporters and lambast officials like new york gov. andrew cuomo “for killing thousands” in his handling of coronavirus, was scrubbed of his photo last week. the account has increasingly returned to providing short updates about the department's media events.

before taking medical leave, caputo had insisted that the upcoming ad campaign should be viewed as a bipartisan priority, referencing democrats’ earlier calls for the administration to communicate more about covid-19.

“i'm not doing anything more than what the democrats asked for. i'm not doing anything more than what the president asked of me,” caputo said in his sept. 13 facebook live video. “as god as my witness, i am not stopping.”

"Fact-Checking Falsehoods on Mail-In Voting - Voters are facing a deluge of misinformation about voting by mail, some prompted by the president. Here’s a guide to those false claims.",15,j09b0v,https://www.nytimes.com/article/fact-checking-mail-in-voting.html,3,1601167312.0,,"if you are among the tens of millions of americans who intend to vote by mail this year, you’re facing a deluge of misinformation about the integrity of that voting method.

much of it is coming from president trump, who has repeatedly attacked state efforts to expand voting by mail. he uses language meant to discourage it, mischaracterizing mail-in ballots as “dangerous,” “unconstitutional,” “a scam” or rife with “fraud.”

his comments are not true. there have been numerous independent studies and government reviews finding voter fraud extremely rare in all forms, including mail-in voting. the president is making these claims to lay the groundwork for possibly not accepting the voting results, going so far as refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses.

here’s a fact check to help debunk some of the common misperceptions and falsehoods.

absentee ballots are more secure than mail-in ballots. false.

mr. trump, in explaining why he favored mail ballots in one state and not in another, has claimed that states like florida — where he himself has voted by mail — are more secure because they use “absentee ballots” rather than mail-in ballots. (the state itself refers to them as “vote-by-mail ballots.”)"
How a Pledge to Dismantle the Minneapolis Police Collapsed,3,j0h85d,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/minneapolis-defund-police.html,3,1601195303.0,[deleted],"minneapolis — over three months ago, a majority of the minneapolis city council pledged to defund the city’s police department, making a powerful statement that reverberated across the country. it shook up capitol hill and the presidential race, shocked residents, delighted activists and changed the trajectory of efforts to overhaul the police during a crucial window of tumult and political opportunity.

now some council members would like a do-over.

councilor andrew johnson, one of the nine members who supported the pledge in june, said in an interview that he meant the words “in spirit,” not by the letter. another councilor, phillipe cunningham, said that the language in the pledge was “up for interpretation” and that even among council members soon after the promise was made, “it was very clear that most of us had interpreted that language differently.” lisa bender, the council president, paused for 16 seconds when asked if the council’s statement had led to uncertainty at a pivotal moment for the city.

“i think our pledge created confusion in the community and in our wards,” she said.

the regrets formalize a retreat that has quietly played out in minneapolis in the months since george floyd was killed by the police and the ensuing national uproar over the treatment of black americans by law enforcement and the country at large. after a summer that challenged society’s commitment to racial equality and raised the prospect of sweeping political change, a cool autumn reality is settling in.

national polls show decreasing support for black lives matter since a sea change of good will in june. in minneapolis, the most far-reaching policy efforts meant to address police violence have all but collapsed."
It's Official: Trump Nominates Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court,95,j0ijwn,https://reason.com/2020/09/26/its-official-trump-nominates-judge-amy-coney-barrett-to-the-supreme-court/,42,1601200407.0,,"president donald trump on saturday announced the nomination of amy coney barrett to fill the supreme court seat previously occupied by the late ruth bader ginsburg, setting the stage for a heated confirmation battle as republicans seek to cement a 6-3 conservative majority.

barrett, currently a federal judge for the u.s. court of appeals for the seventh circuit, first achieved national attention during her 2017 confirmation hearing for that role. in reference to barrett's catholic faith, sen. dianne feinstein (d–calif.) remarked to the judge that ""the dogma lives loudly within you,"" which was heavily criticized as an example of democratic hostility toward religious liberty.

barrett's pro-life outlook will likely be the subject of scrutiny during her upcoming confirmation hearing. it's worth noting, however, that even ginsburg criticized roe v. wade, the landmark abortion rights case, as a decision that reached too far.

the partisan nature of barrett's nomination is also sure to be a subject of intense debate. senate democrats have lamented republicans' willingness to move forward with a supreme court nomination during an election year after declining to consider former president barack obama's 2016 nominee, merrick garland, following the death of justice antonin scalia.

""i want you to use my words against me,"" sen. lindsey graham (r–s.c.) said during a 2016 senate hearing on the subject of the supreme court vacancy. ""if there's a republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say lindsey graham said: let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination. and you could use my words against me and you'd be absolutely right.""

sen. chuck grassley (r–iowa) issued similar comments in july: ""if i were chairman of the committee and this vacancy occurred, i would not have a hearing on it because that's what i promised the people in 2016,"" he said. in a statement following ginsburg's death, grassley reversed course, explaining that the senate should in fact vote on the nominee. ""the circumstances are different in 2020, where the american people elected a republican president and senate in 2016 and expanded the republican senate majority in 2018,"" the statement reads.

sens. lisa murkowski (r–alaska) and susan collins (r–maine) are the only republicans who announced their intention to not vote on a nominee before the presidential election, which still leaves senate republicans with enough votes to confirm barrett should they decide to do so.

some senate democrats have threatened to retaliate by packing the courts with additional justices in the event the senate and white house go blue in the 2020 general election, though democratic presidential nominee joe biden has said he would not support such a move as it would erode any veneer of judicial impartiality. ruth bader ginsburg was similarly skeptical about packing the court.

barrett's judicial portfolio at this point is somewhat scant, as her appointment to the seventh circuit came after a career as an academic at george washington university law school and notre dame law school. thus far, the judge's record is a mixed bag when it comes to criminal cases. two of her opinions are somewhat encouraging: one in which she concluded that the second amendment does not allow a blanket prohibition on gun ownership for those with felony records, and another in which she gutted a qualified immunity defense used by a detective who allegedly framed someone for murder.

the supreme court has continuously shied away from the opportunity to reevaluate qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that makes it considerably more difficult to hold public officials—namely police officers—accountable when they violate your rights. after the high court recently declined to hear a spate of qualified immunity cases, associate justice clarence thomas was the lone judge to push back. if barrett is confirmed, perhaps he will have some company."
