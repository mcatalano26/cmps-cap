G.M. Will Sell Only Zero-Emission Vehicles by 2035,2,l7b05a,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/business/gm-zero-emission-vehicles.html,3,1611901897.0,,"The days of the internal combustion engine are numbered.

General Motors said Thursday that it would phase out petroleum-powered cars and trucks and sell only vehicles that have zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a seismic shift by one of the world’s largest automakers that makes billions of dollars today from gas-guzzling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.

The announcement is likely to put pressure on automakers around the world to make similar commitments. It could also embolden President Biden and other elected officials to push for even more aggressive policies to fight climate change. Leaders could point to G.M.’s decision as evidence that even big businesses have decided that it is time for the world to begin to transition away from fossil fuels that have powered the global economy for more than a century.

G.M.’s move is sure to roil the auto industry, which, between car and parts makers, employed about one million people in the United States in 2019, more than any other manufacturing sector by far. It will also have huge ramifications for the oil and gas sector, whose fortunes are closely tied to the internal combustion engine.

A rapid shift by the auto industry could lead to job losses and business failures in related areas. Electric cars don’t have transmissions or need oil changes, meaning conventional service stations will have to retool what they do. Electric vehicles also require fewer workers to make, putting traditional manufacturing jobs at risk. At the same time, the move to electric cars will spark a boom in areas like battery manufacturing, mining and charging stations."
"Robinhood Stops Users From Trading GameStop Stocks, Other Reddit YOLO Picks",26,l71lly,https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ak7y/robinhood-stops-users-from-trading-gamestop-stocks-other-reddit-yolo-picks,7,1611880563.0,,"Robinhood, the fee-free investment app that has helped Redditors and other retail investors pump dark horse stocks like GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, and Nokia, has stopped allowing users to buy those stocks and other YOLO picks.

According to screenshots shared on social media, on Thursday morning a notification appeared on Robinhood telling users that they could close their position on GameStop's stock but not buy any additional shares. Redditors are currently panicking, looking for ways to transfer their shares of GameStop off of Robinhood to other platforms, and are generally furious at the platform.

In a blog post, Robinhood confirmed that it has placed restrictions on several stocks due to volatility. “We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities,” the blog post read.

Motherboard was unable to place orders to purchase shares or fractional shares of GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, or Nokia in pre-market trading on the RobinHood app. We were able to buy a stock we picked randomly—something called SRNE—with no problem. ""This stock is not supported on Robinhood,"" a message reads when we tried to purchase GME. Searches for ""GameStop"" and ""GME"" on the app itself no longer return any results.

This is likely to have a massive impact on Robinhood users and ultimately the company. Holders are now unable to freely trade it; the app is only allowing users to close out their positions, meaning they can sell it but not buy more. This is potentially devastating for novice investors or those who simply want to follow the general marching orders of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, which is to hold (and buy more) GameStop stock until further notice.

Over the past week, the stock market has gone haywire as retail investors on the /r/WallStreetBets subreddit decided to buy the stock of the video-game retailer GameStop en masse. The idea was that GameStop's stock was extremely undervalued, and that hedge funds had overextended themselves by betting against it, or ""shorting"" it. Now that the meme has caught on and been encouraged by Elon Musk (who famously despises short sellers and whose company Tesla is another retail investor darling), GameStop's stock is worth roughly $350, up from $4 in December. BlackBerry, AMC, and Nokia, other WallStreetBets favorites, are also up.

The result has been chaos for the funds that shorted GameStop, with Melvin Capital needing to call in a multibillion-dollar backstop investment to cover its losses. In response, several large trading platforms temporarily halted trading on the affected stocks. On Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading of GameStop and AMC, and Canada's trading regulator halted BlackBerry. TD Ameritrade restricted users from trading GameStop, AMC, and other stocks, but was not specific about the timeline.

A trading halt is usually implemented to protect investors from volatility or manipulation, usually lasts just a few minutes, and is relatively common. In its announcement on BlackBerry, the Canadian regulator noted that halts are enacted ""to ensure a fair and orderly market."" TD Ameritrade, meanwhile, says it restricted trading ""out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions.""

To many retail investors, these justifications seemed like large platforms running cover for institutional investors being buffeted by the chaos. Chaos, notably, that large institutions often foment and exploit for profit themselves. Indeed, establishment-types are very, very mad at retail investors right now. On Wednesday, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts William Galvin even suggested that platforms should halt trading for an entire month for the affected stocks.

With trading platforms, regulators, and politicians all in the mix now, it seems like the GameStop saga is still far from over.

"N.Y. Severely Undercounted Virus Deaths in Nursing Homes, Report Says",6,l70hh1,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/nyregion/nursing-home-deaths-cuomo.html,3,1611878207.0,,"“This is now more than a nursing home scandal,” said Representative Elise Stefanik, a conservative Republican from upstate New York. “This is a massive corruption and cover-up scandal.”

Deaths in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have accounted for about a third of the nation’s some 430,000 Covid-19 deaths. Federal and state authorities have made vaccinating staff and residents at such facilities a top priority, though that effort has been slower than hoped.

But even as state officials in New York tackle vaccine shortages, the count of deaths in the state’s nursing homes remained a source of controversy. Mr. Cuomo had been accused of obscuring a more accurate estimate of nursing home deaths, because the state’s count only included the number of deaths at the facilities, rather than accounting for the residents who died at a hospital after being transferred there.

For its report, Ms. James’s office surveyed dozens of homes and found consistent discrepancies between deaths reported to the attorney general’s investigators and those reported to and officially released by the Health Department.

In one instance, an unnamed facility reported to the Health Department that it had 11 confirmed and presumed deaths on site through early August. The attorney general’s survey of that same facility, however, found 40 deaths, including 27 at the home and 13 in hospitals.

Another facility reported one confirmed and six presumed Covid-19 deaths to the Health Department, according to the report. The attorney general’s office, however, said the facility reported to its investigators that there were more than four times that number — 31 dead — by mid-April.

The attorney general’s report also scrutinized immunity provisions granted to health care providers codified by Mr. Cuomo in the state budget. The report said the protection of immunity may have prompted some nursing homes to make financially motivated decisions at the height of the pandemic, like admitting patients even when the facilities were facing staff shortages or were unequipped to care for them."
Biden brother touts relationship with president in Inauguration Day ad for law firm,0,l6j28i,https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/27/biden-brother-touts-relationship-with-president-in-inauguration-day-ad-for-law-firm.html?__twitter_impression=true,9,1611822795.0,,"Francis W. ""Frank"" Biden, the younger brother of Vice President Joe Biden, talks about a white powder scare that took place at his Ocean Ridge, Florida home.

President Joe Biden's brother Frank promoted his relationship to the commander-in-chief in an Inauguration Day advertisement for the law firm he advises.

Frank Biden is a non-attorney senior advisor for the Berman Law Group. The firm is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Its ad featuring Frank Biden was printed in the Jan. 20 edition of the Daily Business Review, which is also based in Florida.

The ad focuses on a lawsuit the firm is leading against a group of Florida sugar cane companies. It features a photo of Frank Biden, along with quotes regarding his relationship with the incoming president and the family name.

In an email to CNBC, Frank Biden said he has not used his brother's name to gain clients.

""I have never used my brother to obtain clients for my firm. Our firm has long been involved [with] this lawsuit. Social justice is something I have been involved in for years,"" Frank Biden said. ""I will never be employed by any lobbyist or lobbying firm.""

After CNBC emailed the co-founders of the firm, Matthew Moore, one of Berman Law Group's attorneys, responded on the office's behalf. CNBC had asked the firm whether Frank Biden will be continuing to use the Biden name in future ads while his brother is president, among other questions. The firm's response did not provide answers to those questions.

""Frank Biden has been with the Berman Law Group for years. He is a champion for social justice, advocating against corporate behemoths that prey on the little guy,"" Moore said in an email. ""The big sugar case has been around for more than 2 years and is the poster child for corporate influence. We are honored to have Frank Biden stand with us as leaders for social justice,"" he added.

A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.

After publication of this story, a Biden White House official told CNBC that the president's name should not be used in any commercial activities in a way that suggests a form of endorsement or support.

""It is this White House's policy that the President's name should not be used in connection with any commercial activities to suggest, or in any way that could reasonably understood to imply, his endorsement or support,"" the official told CNBC late Wednesday.

The focus of the ad is to promote the firm's work on a class-action lawsuit against a group of sugar cane growers in southern Florida. The ad and Biden himself highlight the relationship to his brother, who is now the president, as a reason to work with the firm.

""The two Biden brothers have long held a commitment to pushing environmental issues to the forefront; the president-elect has vowed to rejoin the Paris Agreement and wants to set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, for example,"" the ad in the paper says.

""My brother is a model for how to go about doing this work,"" Frank Biden says in the ad. ""One of his central tenets is that one should never question another man's or woman's motives or assign blame to them. That way, you avoid creating a disparity that prevents any kind of coming together. You can of course question someone's judgement, and that's what we're doing by bringing this to court.""

The ad suggests that the firm hired Frank Biden due to the ""Biden reputation for and motivation to engage in philanthropic, social and environmental issues that presented themselves.""

It then lists the 800 phone number for the firm, along with contact information for Frank Biden and the firm's founders. Beyond class-action suits, the firm's website says, it specializes in corporate law, real estate law and government relations, among others.

This isn't the first time Frank Biden has touted his family name while his brother was in a position of power.

ABC News detailed earlier last year many of the occasions that he used his name to assist companies and groups associated with him. In 2011, Frank Biden invoked his last name when his brother was vice president.

Politico and other outlets reported during the 2020 presidential election about other attempts by members of the Biden family, including the president's son Hunter and his other brother, James, to use their last name during business opportunities. Hunter Biden announced in December that he was under investigation for his ""tax affairs"" by federal prosecutors in Delaware.

The Jan. 20 ad featuring Frank Biden raised some concerns among political ethics experts.

Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said that while Frank Biden has the right to promote the Biden name, it's not a great look for him or the administration.

Painter said that either Biden or administration officials should encourage Frank Biden not to use their name and make the message clear to senior officials not to engage with him.

""The Biden White House has to have a very strict protocol on the using of the Biden name,"" Painter told CNBC in an interview Wednesday. ""Brothers, law firm associates and anyone else who is using the Biden name should not be contacting the president or anyone else working with the president.""

When he worked in the Bush administration, Painter said, he worked as part of a team of lawyers who contacted legal representatives for Bush family members and associates to encourage them not to use their last name for business purposes."
"Biden Freezes F-35 Sale to UAE, Munitions Sales to Saudi Arabia",227,l6fkp9,https://www.haaretz.com/amp/us-news/.premium-report-biden-freezes-f-35-sale-to-uae-munitions-sales-to-saudi-arabia-1.9488780?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&__twitter_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR2Y-AZ4kKIGO4Ejbe8drOlcUqLDzcFLuI-qxNR0MJtOTKNmz92yOBfl4U4,17,1611813633.0,,"WASHINGTON – The Biden administration has reportedly temporarily frozen U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates as it reviews billions of dollars in weapons transactions approved by the Trump administration.

skip - Haaretz Weekly 24/1/21

Why Bibi won't stand up to ultra-Orthodox COVID scofflaws: LISTEN

According to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, citing U.S. officials, the United States is specifically reviewing the sale of Lockheed Martin F-35 jets to the UAE and munitions to Saudi Arabia.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during his confirmation hearings last week that the Biden administration would ""take a hard look"" at the UAE sale.

On Wednesday, Blinken clarified that it was not uncommon ""at the start of an administration to review any pending sales to make sure that what is being considered is something that advances our strategic objectives and advances our foreign policy.""

UAE Ambassador to the U.S. Yousef Al Otaiba also sought to reassure, saying in response that his country would work closely with the Biden administration on Middle East peace and stability, noting ""the UAE anticipated a review of current policies.""

""The F-35 package is much more than selling military hardware to a partner,"" he added.

Blinken reiterated his praise of the Abraham Accords, noting that he hopes there is an opportunity to build on them in the months and years ahead, while also trying to ensure the U.S. has ""a full understanding of any commitments that may have been made in securing those agreements.""

The UAE has long expressed interest in acquiring the F-35 jets and was promised a chance to buy them in a side deal when it agreed to normalize ties with Israel last August. The sale has also brought into question whether it would jeopardize Israel's military qualitative edge in the region.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in October said that there had been an ongoing discussion between Defense Ministry officials and the Pentagon and that Israel had received strong assurances about ""the American commitment to preserve Israel’s military qualitative edge.”

Biden, harder on Saudi Arabia

During the presidential campaign, candidate Joe Biden called Saudi Arabia a “pariah,” broadly promising to confront the Kingdom on its human rights record and end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Blinken echoed that promise in his confirmation hearing, calling Yemen ""the worst humanitarian situation in the world.""

""We have real concerns [about] the policies that our Saudi partners have pursued and, accordingly, the president-elect has said we will review the entirety of the relationship to make sure that, as it stands, it is advancing the interests [and is] respectful of the values that we bring to that partnership,"" Blinken said.

In December, Haaretz revealed some of Joe Biden’s previously undisclosed criticisms of Saudi Arabia. In 1986, the Delaware Senator told the Israeli U.S. ambassador he thought the Kingdom was “no more than a collection of 500 princes and their families.” Biden also said that “the fatal mistake in U.S. policy occurred in 1982, when it decided to strive for strategic consensus in the Persian Gulf. The result was a shift of the center of gravity from America’s true friend, Israel, to others [referring to the sale of warplanes to Saudi Arabia].”"
For sale in Oklahoma: a large stockpile of hydroxychloroquine.,22,l66beq,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/world/oklahoma-hydroxychloroquine-stockpile.html,6,1611788723.0,,"The Oklahoma Department of Health is still trying to unload a stockpile of hydroxychloroquine — an antimalarial drug touted by former President Donald J. Trump as a “miracle” cure for Covid-19 despite a lack of evidence that it effectively treats the disease — that it purchased for $2 million last spring.

Mike Hunter, the state’s attorney general, has been brought on to assist the health department in selling back the drug, Alex Gerszewski, a spokesman for Mr. Hunter, said on Tuesday.

The state is attempting to sell the stockpile back to the company it purchased it from, FFF Enterprises, a California-based health care distributor, or to find another buyer, Mr. Gerszewski said. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oklahoma has been trying to unload the stockpile for months. In July, the state health department told News 9, a local TV news station, that it was “working to sell it.”"
Exclusive: Proud Boys leader was ‘prolific’ informer for law enforcement,368,l65th2,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29W1PE,92,1611787219.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys extremist group, has a past as an informer for federal and local law enforcement, repeatedly working undercover for investigators after he was arrested in 2012, according to a former prosecutor and a transcript of a 2014 federal court proceeding obtained by Reuters.

In the Miami hearing, a federal prosecutor, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and Tarrio’s own lawyer described his undercover work and said he had helped authorities prosecute more than a dozen people in various cases involving drugs, gambling and human smuggling.

Tarrio, in an interview with Reuters Tuesday, denied working undercover or cooperating in cases against others. “I don’t know any of this,” he said, when asked about the transcript. “I don’t recall any of this.”

Law-enforcement officials and the court transcript contradict Tarrio’s denial. In a statement to Reuters, the former federal prosecutor in Tarrio’s case, Vanessa Singh Johannes, confirmed that “he cooperated with local and federal law enforcement, to aid in the prosecution of those running other, separate criminal enterprises, ranging from running marijuana grow houses in Miami to operating pharmaceutical fraud schemes.”

Tarrio, 36, is a high-profile figure who organizes and leads the right-wing Proud Boys in their confrontations with those they believe to be Antifa, short for “anti-fascism,” an amorphous and often violent leftist movement. The Proud Boys were involved in the deadly insurrection at the Capitol January 6.

The records uncovered by Reuters are startling because they show that a leader of a far-right group now under intense scrutiny by law enforcement was previously an active collaborator with criminal investigators.

Washington police arrested Tarrio in early January when he arrived in the city two days before the Capitol Hill riot. He was charged with possessing two high-capacity rifle magazines, and burning a Black Lives Matter banner during a December demonstration by supporters of former President Donald Trump. The D.C. Superior Court ordered him to leave the city pending a court date in June.

Though Tarrio did not take part in the Capitol insurrection, at least five Proud Boys members have been charged in the riot. The FBI previously said Tarrio’s earlier arrest was an effort to preempt the events of January 6.

The transcript from 2014 shines a new light on Tarrio’s past connections to law enforcement. During the hearing, the prosecutor and Tarrio’s defense attorney asked a judge to reduce the prison sentence of Tarrio and two co-defendants. They had pleaded guilty in a fraud case related to the relabeling and sale of stolen diabetes test kits.

The prosecutor said Tarrio’s information had led to the prosecution of 13 people on federal charges in two separate cases, and had helped local authorities investigate a gambling ring.

Tarrio’s then-lawyer Jeffrey Feiler said in court that his client had worked undercover in numerous investigations, one involving the sale of anabolic steroids, another regarding “wholesale prescription narcotics” and a third targeting human smuggling. He said Tarrio helped police uncover three marijuana grow houses, and was a “prolific” cooperator.

In the smuggling case, Tarrio, “at his own risk, in an undercover role met and negotiated to pay $11,000 to members of that ring to bring in fictitious family members of his from another country,” the lawyer said in court.

In an interview, Feiler said he did not recall details about the case but added, “The information I provided to the court was based on information provided to me by law enforcement and the prosecutor.”

An FBI agent at the hearing called Tarrio a “key component” in local police investigations involving marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, or ecstasy. The Miami FBI office declined comment.

There is no evidence Tarrio has cooperated with authorities since then. In interviews with Reuters, however, he said that before rallies in various cities, he would let police departments know of the Proud Boys’ plans. It is unclear if this was actually the case. He said he stopped this coordination after December 12 because the D.C. police had cracked down on the group.

Tarrio on Tuesday acknowledged that his fraud sentence was reduced, from 30 months to 16 months, but insisted that leniency was provided only because he and his co-defendants helped investigators “clear up” questions about his own case. He said he never helped investigate others.

That comment contrasts with statements made in court by the prosecutor, his lawyer and the FBI. The judge in the case, Joan A. Lenard, said Tarrio “provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of other persons involved in criminal conduct.”

As Trump supporters challenged the Republican’s election loss in often violent demonstrations, Tarrio stood out for his swagger as he led crowds of mostly white Proud Boys in a series of confrontations and street brawls in Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.

The Proud Boys, founded in 2016, began as a group protesting political correctness and perceived constraints on masculinity. It grew into a group with distinctive colors of yellow and black that embraced street fighting. In September their profile soared when Trump called on them to “Stand back and stand by.”

Tarrio, based in Miami, became the national chairman of the group in 2018.

In November and December, Tarrio led the Proud Boys through the streets of D.C. after Trump’s loss. Video shows him on December 11 with a bullhorn in front of a large crowd. “To the parasites both in Congress, and in that stolen White House,” he said. “You want a war, you got one!” The crowd roared. The next day Tarrio burned the BLM banner.

Former prosecutor Johannes said she was surprised that the defendant she prosecuted for fraud is now a key player in the violent movement that sought to halt the certification of President Joe Biden.

“I knew that he was a fraudster – but had no reason to know that he was also a domestic terrorist,” she said."

WASHINGTON (AP) — These suspects weren’t exactly in hiding.

“THIS IS ME,” one man posted on Instagram with a hand emoji pointing to himself in a picture of the violent mob descending on the U.S. Capitol. “Sooo we’ve stormed Capitol Hill lol,” one woman texted someone while inside the building. “I just wanted to incriminate myself a little lol,” another wrote on Facebook about a selfie he took inside during the Jan. 6 riot.

In dozens of cases, supporters of President Donald Trump downright flaunted their activity on social media on the day of the deadly insurrection . Some, apparently realizing they were in trouble with the law, deleted their accounts only to discover their friends and family members had already taken screenshots of their selfies, videos and comments and sent them to the FBI.

Their total lack of concern over getting caught and their friends’ willingness to turn them in has helped authorities charge about 150 people as of Monday with federal crimes. But even with the help from the rioters themselves, investigators must still work rigorously to link the images to the vandalism and suspects to the acts on Jan. 6 in order to prove their case in court. And because so few were arrested at the scene, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service have been forced to send agents to track suspects down.

“Some of you have recognized that this was such an egregious incident that you’ve turned in your own friends and family members,” Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington office, said of the tipsters Tuesday. “We know that those decisions are often painful, but you picked up the phone because it’s the right thing to do.”

In the last few weeks, the FBI has received more than 200,000 photos and video tips related to the riot. Investigators have put up billboards in several states with photos of wanted rioters. Working on tips from co-workers, acquaintances and friends, agents have tracked down driver’s license photos to match their faces with those captured on camera in the building. In some cases, authorities got records from Facebook or Twitter to connect their social media accounts to their email addresses or phone numbers. In others, agents used records from license plate readers to confirm their travels.

More than 800 are believed to have made their way into the Capitol, although it’s likely not everyone will be tracked down and charged with a crime. Federal prosecutors are focusing on the most critical cases and the most egregious examples of wrongdoing. And they must weigh manpower, cost and evidence when charging rioters.

A special group of prosecutors is examining whether to bring sedition charges against the rioters , which carry up to 20 years in prison. One trio was charged with conspiracy; most have been charged with crimes like unlawful entry and disorderly conduct.

Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin said prosecutors were “closely looking at evidence related to the sedition charges” and he believed “the results will bear fruit very soon.”

Many rioters posted selfies inside the Capitol to their social media accounts, gave interviews to news outlets describing their experience and readily admitted when questioned by federal investigators that they were there. One man created a Facebook album titled “Who’s House? OUR HOUSE” filled with photos of himself and others on Capitol grounds, officials said.

“They might have thought, like so many people that work with Trump, that if the president tells me to do it, it’s not breaking the law,” said Michael Gerhardt, an expert on impeachment and professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.

Others made blunders, like a Houston police officer, who denied he went into the Capitol, then agreed to let agents look at the pictures on his phone. Inside his deleted photos folder were pictures and videos, including selfies he took inside the building, authorities said. Another man was wearing a court-ordered GPS monitor after a burglary conviction that tracked his every movement inside the building.

A retired firefighter from Long Island, New York, texted a video of himself in the Capitol rotunda to his girlfriend’s brother, saying he was “at the tip of the spear,” officials said. The brother happened to be a federal agent with the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service, who turned the video over to the FBI. A lawyer for the man, Thomas Fee, said that he “was not part of any attempt to take over the U.S. Capitol” and that “the allegation is that he merely walked through an open door into the Capitol — nothing more.”

Another man who was inside the Capitol was willing to rat out another rioter who stole House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern and emailed the video to an FBI agent, even signing his own name to it. “Hello Nice FBI Lady,” he wrote, “Here are the links to the videos. Looks like Podium Guy is in one of them, less the podium. Let me know if you need anything else.”

Full Coverage: Capitol siege

In another case, a man was on a flight leaving D.C. two days after the riot when he kept shouting “Trump 2020!” and was kicked off. An airport police officer saw the man get off the plane and the man was booked on another flight. Forty-five minutes later, the officer was watching a video on Instagram and recognized the man in a group of rioters. The man, who was wearing the same shirt as the day he stormed the Capitol, was arrested at the airport, authorities said.

Even defense attorneys have acknowledged that the evidence poses a problem for them.

“I’m not a magician,” said an attorney for the man seen in a photo carrying Pelosi’s lectern. “We’ve got a photograph of our client in what appears to be inside a federal building or inside the Capitol with government property.”

Police at the Capitol planned only for a free-speech demonstration and were overwhelmed by the mob that broke through and roamed the halls of the Capitol for hours as lawmakers were sent into hiding. Five people died in the melee, including a Capitol police officer who was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher.

Trump was impeached after the riot on a charge of “inciting violence against the government of the United States.” Opening arguments will begin the week of Feb. 8. He is the first president to be twice impeached and the first to face a trial after leaving office.

Unlike criminal cases, impeachment trials do not have specific evidence rules so anything said and done that day can be used. And several of the people charged have said in interviews with reporters or federal agents that they were simply listening to the president when they marched to the Capitol.

China Built A Vast New Infrastructure To Imprison Uighurs,34,l5xlta,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-new-internment-camps-xinjiang-uighurs-muslims,3,1611755247.0,,"China rounded up so many Muslims in Xinjiang that there wasn’t enough space to hold them. Then the government started building.

This is Part 1 of a BuzzFeed News investigation. For Part 2, click here. For Part 3, click here. For Part 4, click here. This project was supported by the Open Technology Fund, the Pulitzer Center, and the Eyebeam Center for the Future of Journalism.

China has secretly built scores of massive new prison and internment camps in the past three years, dramatically escalating its campaign against Muslim minorities even as it publicly claimed the detainees had all been set free. The construction of these purpose-built, high-security camps — some capable of housing tens of thousands of people — signals a radical shift away from the country’s previous makeshift use of public buildings, like schools and retirement homes, to a vast and permanent infrastructure for mass detention. In the most extensive investigation of China’s internment camp system ever done using publicly available satellite images, coupled with dozens of interviews with former detainees, BuzzFeed News identified more than 260 structures built since 2017 and bearing the hallmarks of fortified detention compounds. There is at least one in nearly every county in the far-west region of Xinjiang. During that time, the investigation shows, China has established a sprawling system to detain and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities, in what is already the largest-scale detention of ethnic and religious minorities since World War II. These forbidding facilities — including several built or significantly expanded within the last year — are part of the government’s unprecedented campaign of mass detention of more than a million people, which began in late 2016. That year Chen Quanguo, the region’s top official and Communist Party boss, whom the US recently sanctioned over human rights abuses, also put Muslim minorities — more than half the region’s population of about 25 million — under perpetual surveillance via facial recognition cameras, cellphone tracking, checkpoints, and heavy-handed human policing. They are also subject to many other abuses, ranging from sterilization to forced labor.

To detain thousands of people in short order, the government repurposed old schools and other buildings. Then, as the number of detainees swelled, in 2018 the government began building new facilities with far greater security measures and more permanent architectural features, such as heavy concrete walls and guard towers, the BuzzFeed News analysis shows. Prisons often take years to build, but some of these new compounds took less than six months, according to historical satellite data. The government has also added more factories within camp and prison compounds during that time, suggesting the expansion of forced labor within the region. Construction was still ongoing as of this month. “People are living in horror in these places,” said 49-year-old Zhenishan Berdibek, who was detained in a camp in the Tacheng region for much of 2018. “Some of the younger people were not as tolerant as us — they cried and screamed and shouted.” But Berdibek, a cancer survivor, couldn’t muster the energy. As she watched the younger women get dragged away to solitary confinement, “I lost my hope,” she said. “I wanted to die inside the camp.” BuzzFeed News identified 268 newly built compounds by cross-referencing blanked-out areas on Baidu Maps — a Google Maps–like tool that’s widely used in China — with images from external satellite data providers. These compounds often contained multiple detention facilities.

Ninety-two of these facilities have been identified or verified as detention centers by other sources, such as government procurement documents, academic research, or, in 19 cases, visits by journalists. Another 176 facilities have been established by satellite imagery alone. The images frequently show thick walls at the perimeter, and often, barbed wire fencing that creates pens and corridors in the courtyards. Many compounds in the region are walled, but the facilities identified by BuzzFeed News have much heavier fortifications. At 121 of these compounds, they also show guard towers, often built into the perimeter wall. In response to a detailed list of questions about this article as well as a list of GPS coordinates of facilities identified in this article, the Chinese Consulate in New York said “the issue concerning Xinjiang is by no means about human rights, religion or ethnicity, but about combating violent terrorism and separatism,” adding that it was a “groundless lie” that a million Uighurs have been detained in the region.



“Xinjiang has set up vocational education and training centers in order to root out extreme thoughts, enhance the rule of law awareness through education, improve vocational skills and create employment opportunities for them, so that those affected by extreme and violent ideas can return to society as soon as possible,” the consulate added, saying human rights are protected in the centers and that “trainees have freedom of movement.” But it also compared its program to “compulsory programs for terrorist criminals” it said are taking place in other countries including the US and UK. China's Foreign Ministry and Baidu did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The new facilities are scattered across every populated area of the region, and several are large enough to accommodate 10,000 prisoners at a minimum, based on their size and architectural features. (One of the reporters on this story is a licensed architect.) Unlike early sites, the new facilities appear more permanent and prisonlike, similar in construction to high-security prisons in other parts of China. The most highly fortified compounds offer little space between buildings, tiny concrete-walled yards, heavy masonry construction, and long networks of corridors with cells down either side. Their layouts are cavernous, allowing little natural light to the interior of the buildings. BuzzFeed News could see how rooms were laid out at some high-security facilities by examining historical satellite photos taken as they were being constructed, including photos of buildings without roofs. With at least tens of thousands of detainees crowded into government buildings repurposed as camps by the end of 2017, the government began building the largest new facilities in the spring of 2018. Several were complete by October 2018, with further facilities built through 2019 and construction of a handful more continuing even now. The government has said its camps are schools and vocational training centers where detainees are “deradicalized.” The government’s own internal documentation about its policies in Xinjiang has used the term “concentration,” or 集中, to describe “educational schools.” The government claims that its campaign combats extremism in the region. But most who end up in these facilities are not extremists of any sort. Downloading WhatsApp, which is banned in China, maintaining ties with family abroad, engaging in prayer, and visiting a foreign website are all offenses for which Muslims have been sent to camps, according to previously leaked documents and interviews with former detainees. Because the government does not consider internment camps to be part of the criminal justice system and none of these behaviors are crimes under Chinese law, no detainees have been formally arrested or charged with a crime, let alone seen a day in court. The compounds BuzzFeed News identified likely include extrajudicial internment camps — which hold people who are not suspected of any crime — as well as prisons. Both types of facilities have security features that closely resemble each other. Xinjiang’s prison population has grown massively during the government’s campaign: In 2017, the region had 21% of all arrests in China, despite making up less than 2% of the national population — an eightfold increase from the year before, according to a New York Times analysis of government data. Because China’s Communist Party–controlled courts have a more than 99% conviction rate, the overwhelming majority of those arrests likely resulted in convictions.

“One day I saw a pregnant woman in shackles. Another woman had a baby in her arms, she was breastfeeding.”

People detained in the camps told BuzzFeed News they were subjected to torture, hunger, overcrowding, solitary confinement, forced birth control, and a range of other abuses. They said they were put through brainwashing programs focusing on Communist Party propaganda and made to speak only in the Chinese language. Some former detainees said they were forced to labor without pay in factories. The government heavily restricts the movements of independent journalists and researchers in the region, and heavily censors the internet and its own domestic media. Muslim minorities can be punished for posts on social media. But satellite images that are collected from independent providers remain outside the scope of Chinese government censorship. Other kinds of evidence have also occasionally leaked out. In September, a drone video emerged showing hundreds of blindfolded men with their heads shaven and their arms tied behind their backs, wearing vests that say “Kashgar Detention Center.” Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who has done extensive satellite imagery analysis of the detention and prison systems in Xinjiang, said the video shows a prisoner transfer that took place in April 2019 — months after the government first said the system was for vocational training. Previous analyses, including by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in November 2018, identified several dozen early camps. “The internment and assimilation program in Xinjiang has the overall logic of colonial genocides in North America, the formalized racism of apartheid, the industrial-scale internment of Germany's concentration camps, and the police-state penetration into everyday life of North Korea,” said Rian Thum, a scholar of the history of Islam in China at the University of Nottingham. The campaign has done deep damage to many Muslim minority groups — but especially Uighurs, who are by far the most populous ethnic minority group in Xinjiang and do not have ties to any other country. The Chinese government has heavily penalized expressions of Turkic minority culture, from Kazakh- and Uighur-language education to the practice of Islam outside of state-controlled mosques. This, combined with forced sterilizations, has led some critics to say that the campaign qualifies as genocide under international law. The Trump administration is reportedly discussing whether to formally call it a genocide, and a spokesperson for Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, said on Tuesday that Biden supports the label. “These are peaceful people in concentration camps,” said Abduweli Ayup, a Uighur linguist who was jailed and later exiled from Xinjiang after opening kindergartens that taught Uighur children in their own language. “They are businessmen and scholars and engineers. They are our musicians. They are doctors. They are shopkeepers, restaurant owners, teachers who used Uighur textbooks. “These are the pillars of our society. Without them, we cannot exist.”

The position of Muslim minorities, particularly Uighurs, in China has been fraught since the Communist Party came to power in 1949. But conditions deteriorated quickly starting in 2016, when the government implemented a system of heavy-handed surveillance and policing as a means to push Muslims into a growing internment camp system for “transformation through education.” Chen, the region’s party boss, called on officials to “round up everyone who should be rounded up.” Thousands were. Tursunay Ziyawudun, who was detained in March 2018, was one of them. When she arrived at the camp’s gates, she saw hundreds of people around her removing their jewelry, shoelaces, and belts. They were being “processed,” she said, to enter the camp through a security checkpoint.

Early on, the government remade schools, retirement homes, hospitals, and other public buildings into internment camps. There were other, older detention centers available too — BuzzFeed News identified 47 built before 2017 that have been used to lock people up in the region. Some detention facilities are geared toward releasing detainees after several months; in others, detainees may be sentenced to prison terms, said Adrian Zenz, a leading researcher on the abuses in Xinjiang. Three former detainees interviewed by BuzzFeed News said they were held for months in detention without any charges against them — far longer than is allowed by law — before they were transferred to internment camps. The detentions picked up speed in 2017, and numbers in the camps quickly swelled until the inmates were living on top of each other. BuzzFeed News interviewed 28 former detainees from the region, many of whom described being blindfolded and handcuffed, much like the men shown in the video. Many spoke through an interpreter. They are among a tiny minority of former detainees who were released and left the country — but they described a brutal system that they saw growing and changing with their own eyes. Most recalled being frequently moved from camp to camp — a tactic that many believed was meant to combat overcrowding in the first generation of makeshift facilities. At the beginning of the campaign, hundreds of people were arriving on a daily basis. New batches of detainees always seemed to be coming and going. Some former detainees described sleeping two to a twin bed, or even sleeping in shifts when there was not enough room to house all the detainees. Almost all said they received meager quantities of rice, steamed buns, and porridge, and little or no meat or other protein.

Orynbek Koksebek, a 40-year-old ethnic Kazakh, was first detained relatively early in the campaign, around the end of 2017. At first, he slept in a room with seven other men, and everyone had a bed to themselves. But within a few months, he began to notice more and more people arriving. “One day I saw a pregnant woman in shackles,” he said. “Another woman had a baby in her arms, she was breastfeeding.” By February 2018, there were 15 men in his room, he said. “Some of us had to share blankets or sleep on the floor,” he said. “They told us later that some of us would be given prison sentences or transferred to other camps.” Camp officials regularly forced detainees to memorize Communist Party propaganda and Chinese characters in classrooms. But some former detainees said their facilities were too crowded for even this — instead, they had to sit on plastic stools next to their beds and stare at textbooks, sitting with their backs perfectly straight while cameras monitored them. Camp guards told them there were too many people to fit in classrooms. For Koksebek, the claustrophobia was unbearable. “There was a window in our room, but it was so high I couldn’t see much other than a patch of sky,” he said. “I used to wish I were a bird so I could have the freedom to fly.”

BuzzFeed News; Google Maps The camp at Shufu, in Xinjiang, seen by satellite, April 26.

On a frigid, overcast morning last December, Shohrat Zakir, the region’s governor and second-most-powerful official, gave a rare press conference at China’s State Council Information Office, located in a closed compound in central Beijing. The office is one of only a handful of government bodies in China that regularly briefs both local and international journalists, and Zakir sat with four other officials at a long podium at the front of the small room. The officials took the opportunity to tout the region’s economic growth and claim China’s campaign against terrorism in Xinjiang has been a success, calling the US government hypocritical for its criticism of China’s human rights abuses. But Zakir was the one who made international headlines. Of those held in the camps as “trainees,” Zakir painted a rosy picture. They “have all graduated, and have realized stable employment with the government’s help, improved their quality of life, and are enjoying a happy life,” he said. Even as reporters were scribbling down his remarks, about 2,500 miles away in Xinjiang, construction was wrapping up on a massive high-security compound near the Uighur heartland county of Shufu, just south of a winding river that flows through a countryside dotted by livestock farms. Shufu is small by Chinese standards, with a population of about 300,000 people. It has a main drag with a post office, a lottery ticket vendor, and eateries selling steamed buns and beef noodle soup. The camp was built on farmland less than a 20-minute drive away. Before workers started construction last March, the land beneath the Shufu site was farmland too, blanketed with green vegetation. By August, workers had built a thick perimeter enclosure, with guard towers looming in the corners and in the center of walls that rise nearly 6 meters, or more than 19 feet, satellite images show. Next came the buildings inside, organized in U-shaped groups, with two five-story structures alongside a two-story one forming the base of the U. By October, two rows of barbed wire fencing appeared on either side of the main concrete-walled compound, its shadow visible in satellite images. Just outside the walls, on the western side of the compound, two guard buildings were built — distinguished by the narrow walled pathways leading from them up to the wall that would allow guards to access the guard towers and the tops of the walls for patrols. In front of the entrance, a series of buildings provided space for prison offices and police buildings. In total BuzzFeed News estimates that there is room for approximately 10,500 prisoners at this compound — which would help provide a long-term solution to overcrowding.

“I wasn’t happy or sad. I couldn’t feel anything. Even when I was reunited with my relatives in Kazakhstan, they asked me why I didn’t seem happy to see them after so long.”

Ruser reviewed satellite images of the compound and said it was a newly built detention camp. “The vast majority of camps have watchtowers, internal fencing, and a strong external wall entranceway or exit,” he said. Unlike the old, repurposed camps, new prisons and camps such as this one have higher security, with gates up to four stories tall and thicker walls along their borders, often with further layers of barbed wire on either side of the main walls. These features suggest they are capable of holding much larger groups of people in long-term detention.

The camps can contain not only cells where detainees sleep, but also classrooms, clinics, canteens, stand-alone shower facilities, solitary confinement rooms, police buildings, administrative offices, and small visitor centers, former detainees told BuzzFeed News. Many of the compounds also contain factories, distinguished by their blue, powder-coated metal roofs and steel frames, which are visible in satellite photos taken while they were being constructed. The police buildings, including for guards and administrative personnel, are usually located by the entrances of the compounds. The locations of these camps and prisons in Xinjiang are not readily available. However, blanked-out portions of maps on China's Baidu make it possible to use satellite imagery to find and analyze them. Satellite maps, like Google Earth, are made up of a grid of rectangular tiles. On Baidu, the Chinese search giant that has a map service much like Google’s, BuzzFeed News discovered that spaces containing camps, military bases, or other politically sensitive facilities were overlaid with plain light gray tiles. These “mask” tiles appeared upon zooming in on the location. These look different from the darker gray, watermarked tiles that appear when Baidu cannot load something. The “mask” tiles were also present at other locations where camps had been visited and verified by journalists, though they have since been removed.

BuzzFeed News identified the compounds using other satellite maps — provided by Google Earth, Planet Labs, and the European Space Agency’s Sentinel Hub — which do not mask those images. For some locations where high-resolution images were not publicly available, Planet Labs used its own satellite to take new pictures, then provided them to BuzzFeed News. Read more here about how this investigation was conducted. The images showed the facilities being built over a period of months. Details from the images offer a sense of size and scale: Counting the number of windows in building facades, for example, shows how many stories they contain. Often, these compounds were built next door to an older prison, sharing parking lots, administrative facilities, and police barracks with the older facility, satellite images show. BuzzFeed News found an additional 50 more compounds that were likely used for internment in the past but have lost some security features, including barbed wire fencing within compounds used to create rectangular pens, closed passages between buildings, and guard towers, with a small number having been demolished. Ruser and other experts said this does not suggest the Chinese government is pulling back from its campaign. Many of those facilities likely still operate as low-security camps, he said. The far more important trend in Xinjiang, he said, is the government’s increased use of higher-security prisons and detention facilities. In response to questions, the Chinese Consulate in New York echoed Zakir's December statement.



""All trainees who received courses in standard spoken and written Chinese, understanding of the law, vocational skills, and deradicalization have completed their training, secured stable employment in the society, and are living a normal life,"" it said.



Ekaterina Anchevskaya For BuzzFeed News Nurlan Kokteubai at his home in Shonzhy, Kazakhstan, Feb. 26.

All of the detainees interviewed by BuzzFeed News were released too long ago to have spent any time in one of the brand-new facilities — many said that before they escaped China for good, they were kept under de facto house or town arrest, unable to venture past the borders of their villages without obtaining permission from a police officer. Many — especially those with less formal education — had no idea what type of facility they were held in or even why they had been detained in the first place. They said they often drew conclusions based on weekly interrogation sessions, where police asked about actions that made them “untrustworthy.” An older ethnic Kazakh man named Nurlan Kokteubai recognized the camp he was taken to as soon as he arrived in September 2017. Not long before, it had been a middle school. “My daughter went to that school,” he said. “I had picked her up there before.”

Bitter Winter The front entrance of the former Third Middle School in Qapqal Xibe, where Kokteubai's daughter went to school.

Smile lines appear on Kokteubai’s deeply wrinkled face when he talks about his daughter, who was born in 1992. She later moved to Kazakhstan, where many ethnic Kazakhs from China emigrate because of the Kazakh government’s resettlement policy for people of Kazakh descent. There, she and her husband campaigned relentlessly for Kokteubai’s release in YouTube videos and long letters to human rights groups. He believes his eventual release in March 2018 was due to her campaign. Inside the camp, instead of classrooms where students like his daughter might have studied math or history, Kokteubai saw dorm rooms overcrowded with as many as 40 or 50 men each sleeping on too few bunk beds. Though the compound itself wasn’t new, it had many updated features, such as high walls and barbed wire around the compound. And the camp was now dotted with CCTV cameras, which a guard told him could film objects as far as 200 meters away. Another thing that was new: When you entered the gate, a huge red plaque greeted you. “Let’s learn the spirit of the 19th Communist Party Congress,” it said. Like Kokteubai, several former detainees interviewed by BuzzFeed News said after arriving, they recognized the facilities in which they were held because they had walked or driven past them, or even visited them in their previous incarnations. But these repurposed facilities were never meant to house prisoners and were not big enough to hold all the Muslim minorities the Chinese government intended to detain. In early 2019, workers started clearing land to expand a camp south of Ürümqi, in a town called Dabancheng, that had become infamous after reporters from BBC and Reuters visited the year before. The camp at Dabancheng was already one of the largest internment facilities in the region, capable in October 2018 of housing up to 32,500 people, according to an architectural analysis by BuzzFeed News. Since the expansion, it is now capable of housing some 10,000 more people. By November of last year another, separate compound had been completed, this one capable of holding a further 10,000 people — for a total capacity of more than 40,000, comparable to the size of the town of Niagara Falls. ""These facilities display characteristics consistent with extrajudicial detention facilities in the Xinjiang region that CSIS has previously analyzed,"" said Amy Lehr, director of the human rights program at Washington DC-based think tank CSIS after examining the three camps referenced in this article.

The camp at Dabancheng, Ruser said, “is the main catchment camp for Ürümqi. It’s 2 km (1.2 miles) long and was expanded late last year an extra kilometer with a new facility across the road to the west.” By comparison, the camp is about half the length of Central Park. Kokteubai never found out precisely why he was detained. Because he’s ethnic Kazakh, he was eventually able to settle in Kazakhstan.



On the day he was released, he expected to feel joy, relief, something. Instead he felt nothing at all. “I wasn’t happy or sad. I couldn’t feel anything,” he said. “Even when I was reunited with my relatives in Kazakhstan, they asked me why I didn’t seem happy to see them after so long.” “It’s something I can’t explain,” he said. “It’s like my feelings died while I was in there.” ●"
Republicans Signal Senate Will Acquit Trump In Impeachment,40,l5paxm,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/mcconnell-republicans-vote-block-trump-impeachment-trial,17,1611728478.0,,"WASHINGTON — The Senate rejected Sen. Rand Paul’s attempt to toss out Donald Trump’s second impeachment as unconstitutional Tuesday, but the gambit showed that Republicans are still overwhelmingly standing behind Trump even after he left office and are likely to acquit him.

Paul forced a vote arguing that Trump’s second impeachment trial is unconstitutional because he is no longer in office. Every Democrat voted against Paul, but they were joined by only five of 50 Republican senators — Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, and Pat Toomey. The 55–45 vote means Trump’s impeachment trial will go ahead.

Though Paul’s attempt failed, he succeeded in showing that there are more than enough Republicans loyal to Trump to acquit him in the trial. Before the vote, Paul correctly predicted that north of 40 Republicans would object to the trial. He said this demonstrates that the push to impeach Trump is “dead on arrival.”

It requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors for inciting a mob to storm the Capitol, meaning just 34 votes are enough to acquit. Democrats had hoped to get enough Republican support to convict Trump and then prevent him from running for office again with a simple majority vote. Nine out of ten Republican senators are now on record as saying the trial is unconstitutional. In theory, some could change their votes after hearing the case against Trump, but that would mean voting to convict in a trial that they already tried to toss out as illegitimate.

The vote shows the massive hold Trump still has over the Republican establishment, even after leaving the White House. Trump has no reluctance to try to destroy his intra-party critics, regularly calling for his supporters to launch primary challenges against his Republican opponents and vote them out of office.

Just moments before the vote Mitch McConnell, the head Republican in the Senate, would not say whether he believes Trump committed impeachable offenses by denying the election results and urging his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn them. He then voted in support of Paul’s point of order.

Paul’s pitch that Trump’s impeachment is unconstitutional rested largely on semantics. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say a former president cannot be impeached. Instead, Paul argued that because the Constitution refers to “the president”, Congress’s impeachment powers only refer to the sitting president. (Trump was impeached by the House while still in office).

“If the accused is no longer president, where is the constitutional power to impeach him? Private citizens don’t get impeached,” Paul said on the Senate floor.

Constitutional scholars have largely dismissed his interpretation and there is historical precedent working against him. In 1876, War Secretary William Belknap attempted to head off a House vote on whether to impeach him for corruption by handing in his resignation just moments before the vote. The House voted to impeach him anyway and the Senate took up the trial, despite him being out of office. He ended up being narrowly acquitted.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Paul’s interpretation defies both historical context and “basic common sense.” He said it would give presidents a “constitutional get out of jail free card” allowing them to commit crimes just before leaving office without suffering consequences.

When reporters asked Paul about his interpretation of the Constitution giving presidents a blank check at the end of their term, he said that reputational damage would keep them in check. “I think that people are always judged based on their actions and there is probably a penalty that is being paid,” said Paul.

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson went even further than Paul, urging senators to declare Trump’s impeachment unconstitutional whether or not that is true.

Johnson said he was personally conflicted about whether Congress has the power to impeach a former president, saying “there are good arguments on both sides.” He said senators should consider questions such as “will it heal, will it unify” when voting.

Biden plans to limit private prisons and transfer of military equipment to police,452,l5gifd,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden/biden-plans-to-limit-private-prisons-and-transfer-of-military-equipment-to-police-idUSKBN29V15H,66,1611704492.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday issued a firm call to heal America’s racial divide, taking several steps and promising more to confront racism and inequality that he said has plagued the United States for far too long.

Racial tensions simmered during the turbulent four-year presidency of Donald Trump and in issuing several executive orders, Biden noted that the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters was carried out by “thugs, insurrectionists, political extremists and white supremacists.”

But Biden said he believes the vast majority of Americans believe in equality.

“We’ve never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation - to state the obvious - that all people are created equal and have a right to be treated equally throughout their lives,” Biden said in remarks at the White House. “And it’s time to act now, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because if we do we’ll all be better off for it.”

Biden took executive action on four fronts: curbing the U.S. government’s use of private prisons, bolstering anti-discrimination enforcement in housing, underscoring a commitment to Native American tribal sovereignty and condemning discrimination against Asian Americans and Americans of Pacific Island descent he said has risen during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Democratic president has sought to roll back some of the policies of his Republican predecessor and deliver on racial justice reforms he promised during the election campaign.

Biden and other critics accused Trump of pursuing policies built around “white grievance” in a nation where the white population is declining by percentage.

But Biden drew criticism from some Republicans when he used his inaugural address last week to decry white supremacy and political extremism.“If you read his speech and listen to it carefully, much of it is thinly veiled innuendo calling us white supremacists, calling us racists, calling us every name in the book,” U.S. Senator Rand Paul told Fox News last week.

Black voters proved essential to Biden first in winning his party’s presidential nomination and then in defeating Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

The United States, still struggling with the legacy of slavery, was rocked by protests against racism and police brutality in many cities last year in response to incidents including the death of Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May 2020.

Trump condemned those protests and attempted to use them to stoke fear and unease among voters during the presidential campaign.

On the day he took office last week, Biden signed an executive order establishing a government-wide initiative to address racial inequity and systemic racism in federal policies, laws and programs.

Biden drew criticism from some Republicans when he used his inaugural address to decry white supremacy and political extremism.“If you read his speech and listen to it carefully, much of it is thinly veiled innuendo calling us white supremacists, calling us racists, calling us every name in the book,” Senator Rand Paul told Fox News last week.

‘I PROMISE YOU’

On Tuesday, Biden said in the coming weeks he would reaffirm a federal “commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and accessibility.”

“Again, I’m not promising we can end it tomorrow, but I promise you we’re going to continue to make progress to eliminate systemic racism, and every branch of the White House and the federal government is going to be part of that effort,” Biden said.

Interest groups as diverse as the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised Biden’s moves.

Biden said his order directing the Justice Department not to renew its contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities is intended to ultimately end the department’s use of private prisons.

The order did not address contracts for private prisons by the Department of Homeland Security, which uses such facilities to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally.

Biden described the move as the first step to “stop corporations from profiting” from the incarceration of inmates, and said it was just the start of his administration’s plan to address systemic problems in the criminal justice system.

Biden called for restoring and expanding the landmark Voting Rights Act even as many states pursue Republican-backed measures that Democrats have said are intended to suppress voting rights.

After losing the election, Trump made repeated and false claims of widespread voting fraud and irregularities as part of his failed effort to overturn Biden’s victory.

The Biden administration’s newly announced fair-housing policy will require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to study and counteract the racially discriminatory impacts of previous policies.

“Housing is a right in America and home ownership is an essential tool to wealth creation and to be passed down to generations,” Biden said."
McConnell Relents On Senate Filibuster Stalemate,189,l5dx6s,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/26/960621238/mcconnell-relents-on-senate-filibuster-stalemate,14,1611696306.0,,"McConnell Relents On Senate Filibuster Stalemate

Updated at 8:12 a.m. ET

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell dropped his demand that Democrats maintain the Senate filibuster — ending an early stalemate in the Senate that prevented party leaders from negotiating a power-sharing agreement.

Late Monday, McConnell said he was ready to move forward after two Democrats signaled they would not vote to end the legislative filibuster, assuring him that it would stay in place. The position of the two moderate Democrats — Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema — also ensured that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer lacked the votes to end the filibuster, a key demand from his party's left.

McConnell had demanded that the filibuster rule remain in exchange for his cooperation on reallocating power in the Senate, which is evenly divided for the first time in two decades. The Democrats control the chamber since Vice President Harris would break any tie.

For now, Democrats and Republicans will operate on a power-sharing deal that follows the model used in 2001 — the last time the Senate had a 50-50 split. That means the party with the vice presidency and tiebreaking powers has control of the floor agenda.

Still, both sides spun the development as a victory.

""The legislative filibuster was a key part of the foundation beneath the Senate's last 50-50 power-sharing agreement in 2001,"" McConnell said Monday, voicing his approval of the compromise. ""With these assurances, I look forward to moving ahead with a power-sharing agreement modeled on that precedent.""

Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer, said: ""We're glad Sen. McConnell threw in the towel and gave up on his ridiculous demand. We look forward to organizing the Senate under Democratic control and start getting big, bold things done for the American people.""

McConnell's change of heart followed assurances from Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sinema, D-Ariz., that they would not vote to end the filibuster.

""They agree with President Biden's and my view that no Senate majority should destroy the right of future minorities of both parties to help shape legislation,"" McConnell said.

Now, McConnell and Schumer can negotiate an organizing resolution, which will lay out the terms of the power-sharing agreement.

Without such a deal, the Senate would have been essentially paralyzed with Senate Democrats unable to take full control of the chamber, despite being in the majority.

Democrats would have maintained control of the floor and the legislative agenda, but leadership of key committees would have been retained by Republicans. Committee assignments for newly sworn-in members could not have moved forward and key legislative priorities for the new Biden administration, including a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, would be stonewalled.

Still, the deal is likely to be tested. Senate Republicans could use the filibuster to stymie President Biden's legislative agenda, increasing pressure on Schumer to end the legislative maneuver."
Biden vows to replace U.S. government fleet with electric vehicles,181,l54yrn,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-autos/biden-vows-to-replace-u-s-government-fleet-with-electric-vehicles-idUSKBN29U2LW,54,1611659973.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Monday vowed to replace the U.S. government’s fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric models as the new administration shifts its focus toward clean-energy.

“The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we’re going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America made by American workers,” Biden said Monday

Biden criticized existing rules that allow vehicles to be considered U.S. made when purchased by the U.S. government even if they have significant non-American made components.

Biden said he would close “loopholes” that allow key parts like engines, steel and glass to be manufactured abroad for vehicles considered U.S. made.

The White House did not immediately answer questions about over what period Biden planned to replace current vehicles. It could cost the U.S. $20 billion or more to replace the fleet.

Biden’s “Buy America” executive order signed Monday does not direct the purchase of electric vehicles.

As of 2019, the U.S. government owned 645,000 vehicles that were driven 4.5 billion miles consuming 375 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel, according to the General Services Administration (GSA). The U.S. government spent $4.4 billion on federal vehicle costs in 2019, the GSA said.

Of U.S.-government vehicles, just 3,215 were electric vehicles as of July 2020, GSA said.

During the campaign, Biden vowed to “make a major federal commitment to purchase clean vehicles for federal, state, tribal, postal, and local fleets.”

He also vowed to create 1 million new jobs in the “American auto industry, domestic auto supply chains, and auto infrastructure, from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging stations.”

Biden backs new consumers rebates to replace old, less-efficient vehicles with newer electric vehicles and incentives for manufacturers to build or retool factories to assemble EVs and parts.

Biden vows to build 550,000 EV charging stations and spend more in clean energy research."
Joe Biden’s First Day Began the End of Girls’ Sports,0,l5302y,https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-bidens-first-day-began-the-end-of-girls-sports-11611341066,7,1611653570.0,,"Amid Inauguration Day talk of shattered glass ceilings, on Wednesday President Biden delivered a body blow to the rights of women and girls: the Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation. On day one, Mr. Biden placed all girls’ sports and women’s safe spaces in the crosshairs of the administrative state.

The order declares: “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the rest room, the locker room, or school sports. . . . All persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.” The order purports to direct administrative agencies to begin promulgating regulations that would enforce the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision Bostock v. Clayton County. In fact, it goes much further.

In Bostock, the justices held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited an employer from firing an employee on the basis of homosexuality or “transgender status.” Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for a 6-3 majority, took pains to clarify that the decision was limited to employment and had no bearing on “sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes”—all regulated under Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments. “Under Title VII, too,” the majority added, “we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.”

The Biden executive order is far more ambitious. Any school that receives federal funding—including nearly every public high school—must either allow biological boys who self-identify as girls onto girls’ sports teams or face administrative action from the Education Department. If this policy were to be broadly adopted in anticipation of the regulations that are no doubt on the way, what would this mean for girls’ and women’s sports?

“Finished. Done,” Olympic track-and-field coach Linda Blade told me. “The leadership skills, all the benefits society gets from letting girls have their protected category so that competition can be fair, all the advances of women’s rights—that’s going to be diminished.” Ms. Blade noted that parents of teen girls are generally uninterested in watching their daughters demoralized by the blatant unfairness of a rigged competition."
Manchin emphatic he 'will not vote' to kill the filibuster,57,l50ewp,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/25/joe-manchin-filibuster-462364,21,1611645589.0,,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has pushed for a guarantee that the Senate’s 60-vote threshold for most legislation remains in place this Congress after Democrats took the Senate and White House, giving them a slim majority in a tied Senate. The impasse has left the Senate’s committees unorganized and hobbled the Democrats from moving quickly in Biden’s first days.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday afternoon that Democrats are “not letting McConnell dictate how the Senate operates. He’s minority leader.” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), one of Schumer’s top deputies, said that Democrats will still seek a bipartisan resolution to organize the Senate and its committees “but in the end we have to organize … the clock is ticking.”

In theory, Democrats could change Senate rules to install an organizing resolution unilaterally. But they might not have the votes to do that. And Manchin hopes his guarantee is good enough for McConnell and that it will unstick the standoff between McConnell and Schumer.

“I'm in the same place I've always been. Busting the filibuster under any conditions is wrong. We can organize the Senate. I’m sure we can work through that. If he knows as strongly as I feel about it?” Manchin said of McConnell. Manchin stands to be Energy Committee chairman when the Senate finally reaches a deal on organizing.

Some centrist Democrats have said if Republicans abuse the filibuster, they might be open to revisiting the filibuster rules. And most every Senate Democrat opposes bowing to McConnell’s demands in the opening days of their majority.

But it seems that no matter the conditions in the next two years, Democrats won’t be able to get the total party unification they would need to enact a rules change. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) also opposes eliminating the filibuster and said she’s as firm as Manchin and is “not open to changing her mind,” her office said on Monday."
"Twitter launches 'Birdwatch,' a forum to combat misinformation — with your help",18,l4vup4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/twitter-launches-birdwatch-forum-combat-misinformation-n1255552,3,1611632973.0,,"Twitter unveiled a feature Monday meant to bolster its efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation by tapping users in a fashion similar to Wikipedia to flag potentially misleading tweets.

The new system allows users to discuss and provide context to tweets they believe are misleading or false. The project, titled Birdwatch, is a standalone section of Twitter that will at first only be available to a small set of users, largely on a first-come, first-served basis. Priority will not be provided to high-profile people or traditional fact-checkers, but users will have to use an account tied to a real phone number and email address.

“Birdwatch allows people to identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading or false, and write notes that provide informative context,"" Twitter Vice President of Product Keith Coleman wrote in a press release. ""We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable.""

While Birdwatch will initially be cordoned off to a separate section of Twitter, the company said “eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.”

Demos of the product viewed by NBC News showed a separate area in which tweets are discussed and rated in a format that combines elements of both Reddit’s and Wikipedia’s moderation tools.

Birdwatch users are able to flag tweets from a dropdown menu directly within Twitter’s main interface, but discussion about a tweet’s veracity will remain exclusively in the Birdwatch section. Twitter says it does anticipate some users linking directly to Birdwatch discussions underneath high-profile and controversial tweets, just as some users would link out to fact-checking sites."
Our Radicalized Republic,16,l4sxfd,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-radicalized-republic/,3,1611625201.0,,"our years ago, Lilliana Mason learned something she really, really hoped wasn’t true. A political scientist who studies Americans’ attitudes about politics and each other, she had long known that the citizens of this country were growing increasingly resentful and distrustful of the people we saw as our political opponents.

But it’s one thing to not like somebody — it’s another to want to hurt them.

“I thought it probably went, you know, probably as far as like dehumanization … that type of thing,” she said. Instead, she found that, for 15-20 percent of Americans, physical violence against political opponents was not a dealbreaker. In multiple surveys conducted by Mason and her coauthor Nathan Kalmoe, this large, bipartisan minority said violence was at least a little bit justified — particularly if their party lost the 2020 election.

[Related: How Has The Radical Right Evolved Under Trump?]

Then, on Jan. 6, Mason sat in her living room, watching on TV as, just 6 miles away, a mob of armed right-wing extremists scaled the walls and poured through the windows of the U.S. Capitol. She thought about her research and was suddenly, absolutely livid. Her children were terrified. Her options to leave the city were stymied by a global pandemic. And her data — once a theoretical risk that she’d struggled to get other academics to take seriously — had jumped off the page and begun to beat a police officer to death with a fire extinguisher.





“I knew this was gonna happen,” she said. “I really didn’t want it. But like, they did it, you know? Like goddammit. They finally did it.”

What happened at the Capitol was the culmination of years of right-wing extremism, a political force that has increasingly manifested as actual violence. But Mason’s research — and her worries — go beyond right-wing extremists. Much of this nation now hates Americans who don’t affiliate with their party. The reasons for and consequences of that hatred look very different on the right than on the left, but it still leaves President Biden with a nearly impossible task: governing a radicalized country.

For decades, researchers like Mason have watched as multiple trends — white Americans’ resentment of Black Americans, growth in inequality, how we feel about political opponents — pointed this country in a dangerous direction. Any one of these things, on their own, can destabilize democracies and lead to violence, experts told us. We are grappling with some half dozen. And now the country has come to a place where it’s much, much easier to throw a punch than to work things out. None of that is likely to change just because we have a new administration focused on unity.

Underlying all the trends pushing Americans apart is a fundamental disagreement about who does and should have power. Should politicians strive to make a multicultural democracy devoted to solving social inequality? Or should they preserve a social hierarchy that allows white people (and in particular, white men) to hold disproportionate sway?

Trump made clear who he thought should be in power. His willingness to use racial slurs, enact racist policies and declare that Christians should have a privileged place in American life helped create a world where both left and right support political violence at about the same rates, but the right is more likely to act on it. But now that he’s gone, the fissure won’t just close behind him. And even if Biden were somehow able to unite warring sides, it would likely require a level of compromise that would do more harm than good.

“There’s no way this goes away quietly,” Mason said.

Part 1

Decades of Drift

This is not the first time that a group of Americans decided that winning an election was more important than maintaining a democracy. In fact, it’s because of those other examples that we know which sociopolitical trends to beware of.

On Nov. 10, 1898, following a municipal election that had installed an integrated city council, white elites from the city of Wilmington, North Carolina mobilized a mob that burned down the town’s Black newspaper, killed hundreds of Black residents and forced the newly elected council members to resign at gunpoint. It was a riot, organized and planned in advance, and aided by people in charge of the government so they could stay in power — pesky electoral outcomes be damned.

Unlike the assault on the Capitol this year, that coup was successful. But the two incidents share some important underlying factors, said Suzanne Mettler, a professor of government at Cornell University. In the wake of Reconstruction, political polarization, conflict over who counts as “one of us” (which has always been about race) and income inequality were all on the rise, creating the tinder for insurrection. For more than 30 years now, those same forces have been gaining strength in this country.

One of the most toxic is racial animosity — resentment and anger that take shape as the belief that people of another race aren’t like you, can’t be trusted and don’t deserve what you deserve. This is something that the American National Election Studies survey has tracked since 1988, asking respondents questions like whether they believe Black Americans should overcome prejudices like “Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities [did]” and pull themselves up by their bootstraps “without any favors,” or if they believe Black Americans would be just as well off as white Americans “if [they] would only try harder.”

[Related: Storming The U.S. Capitol Was About Maintaining White Power In America]

Research has shown that levels of racial resentment among white Americans towards their Black counterparts have hardly budged since the 80s. But those attitudes have become increasingly connected to our political beliefs. Put it this way: The average white person may not be any more (or, for that matter, less) racist than they were 40 years ago, but their level of racism is now much more likely to correlate with everything from their political ideology, to whom they vote for, to how they feel about people in the opposing party — and even their support for specific policies on issues like health care. Unlike in the late 80s, racial resentment now strongly tracks along party lines. “Just saying that there is a serious problem of racism in America — that alone makes many Republicans, many Trump supporters, very angry,” Mason said.

Income inequality, too, has been on the rise. The highest-earning 20 percent of U.S. households capture a larger share of the country’s overall income than they did 40 years ago, the gap between the richest and poorest families has more than doubled, millennials are far less likely than baby boomers to earn more than their parents did, and in 2019, the US Census Bureau found that economic inequality was the highest since the Census Bureau started tracking it.

And while this trend has affected Americans of all stripes, it is also deeply racialized. Centuries of white supremacy and decades of growing inequality have produced a racial wealth chasm, where economic security is especially difficult for households of color to achieve.

[Why The Suburbs Have Shifted Blue]

And there are yet more destabilizing trends you could also include in our current moment, like rising distrust in (and resentment of) government and public institutions. Or societal segregation that sifts Americans into social silos where everyone we know personally is pretty similar to ourselves.

All these trends, especially when they layer on top of and reinforce each other, help create an atmosphere where violence against opponents is rationalized and politics becomes a game to win at any cost. That has manifested differently between people of separate ideologies. Although support for political violence is roughly equal among Democrats and Republicans in survey data, the right wing has produced significantly more real-world political violence in this country over the last decade, according to the Global Terrorism Database.





Why police aggression is far more pronounced against left-leaning protesters

Despite that, the way we all think about public disagreement has shifted, said Jennifer McCoy, a professor of political science at Georgia State University. There’s a difference between “I don’t like your ideas” and “I don’t like you.” There’s also a difference between “I don’t like you” and “You have no legitimate claim to political power and don’t deserve it.” Eventually, you get to a place where fewer and fewer people believe in government by and for all the people.

It isn’t absolute cause-and-effect. You can probably let your democracy get wet or feed it after midnight every now and then without all hell breaking loose. But the more of these trends that are in play, the more seductive extremism (of any kind) becomes. Right now, we’re sitting with a plate of tangled spaghetti — worrisome political trends that knot together in ways that almost ensure if you’re slurping up one of them, you’ll end up with another on the end of your fork. Higher levels of economic inequality, after all, are correlated with an increase in hate crimes. Growing mistrust of government is associated with an increased support for outsider political candidates — who, in turn, tend to use rhetoric that further delegitimizes politicians and governmental institutions outside themselves. “They might not be able to articulate it, [but when you see] the person foaming at the mouth next to the person who seems reasonable … they fit together because of this latent lived experience with regards to what is going on,” said Christian Davenport, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan.

And that’s why political polarization is one of the most troubling trends. Not only has it grown by leaps and bounds since the 1980s, but it’s tied into everything else — race, inequality and even who you get a chance to vote for in a general election. How you feel about other Americans who don’t share your beliefs shapes how willing you are to embrace democracy."

BALTIMORE (AP) — President Joe Biden plans to sign on Monday an executive order that aims to boost government purchases from U.S. manufacturers, according to administration officials.

The United States has shed roughly 540,000 factory jobs since last February as the coronavirus pandemic hurled the world’s largest economy into recession . The goal of the order would be to use the $600 billion the federal government spends on procurement to boost domestic factories and hiring, said officials who insisted on anonymity to discuss the forthcoming announcement.

Biden’s order would modify the rules for the Buy American program, making it harder for contractors to qualify for a waiver and sell foreign-made goods to federal agencies. It also changes rules so that more of a manufactured good’s components must originate from U.S. factories. American-made goods would also be protected by an increase in the government’s threshold and price preferences, the difference in price over which the government can buy a foreign product.

The order also has elements that apply to the separate Buy America program, which applies separately to highways and bridges. It seeks to open up government procurement contracts to new companies by scouting potential contractors. The order would create a public website for companies that received waivers to sell foreign goods to the government, so that U.S. manufacturers can have more information and be in a more competitive position.

To help enforce these goals, the order establishes a job at the White House Office of Management and Budget to monitor the initiative and focus on ensuring the government buys more domestically made goods. It also requires federal agencies to report on their progress in purchasing American goods, as well as emphasizing Biden’s support for the Jones Act, which mandates that only U.S.-flag vessels carry cargo between U.S. ports.

Past presidents have promised to revitalize manufacturing as a source of job growth and achieved mixed results. The government helped save the automotive sector after the 2008 financial crisis, but the number of factory jobs has been steadily shrinking over the course of four decades.

The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979 at 19.5 million and now totals 12.3 million, according to the Labor Department. Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, famously promised a factory renaissance, yet manufacturing employment never returned to its pre-Great Recession levels before the coronavirus struck."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The number of western monarch butterflies wintering along the California coast has plummeted precipitously to a record low, putting the orange-and-black insects closer to extinction, researchers announced Tuesday.

An annual winter count by the Xerces Society recorded fewer than 2,000 butterflies, a massive decline from the tens of thousands tallied in recent years and the millions that clustered in trees from Northern California’s Marin County to San Diego County in the south in the 1980s.

Western monarch butterflies head south from the Pacific Northwest to California each winter, returning to the same places and even the same trees, where they cluster to keep warm. The monarchs generally arrive in California at the beginning of November and spread across the country once warmer weather arrives in March.

On the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, another monarch population travels from southern Canada and the northeastern United States across thousands of miles to spend the winter in central Mexico. Scientists estimate the monarch population in the eastern U.S. has fallen about 80% since the mid-1990s, but the drop-off in the western U.S. has been even steeper.

The Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey last winter. That was not much different than the tally the winter before, when an all-time low of 27,000 monarchs were counted.

But the count this year is dismal. At iconic monarch wintering sites in the city of Pacific Grove, volunteers didn’t see a single butterfly this winter. Other well-known locations, such as Pismo State Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove and Natural Bridges State Park, only hosted a few hundred butterflies, researchers said.

“These sites normally host thousands of butterflies, and their absence this year was heartbreaking for volunteers and visitors flocking to these locales hoping to catch a glimpse of the awe-inspiring clusters of monarch butterflies,” said Sarina Jepsen, director of endangered species at the Xerces Society.

Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in western states because of destruction to their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases.

Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change. Along with farming, climate change is one of the main drivers of the monarch’s threatened extinction, disrupting an annual 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) migration synched to springtime and the blossoming of wildflowers. Massive wildfires throughout the U.S. West last year may have influenced their breeding and migration, researchers said.

A 2017 study by Washington State University researchers predicted that if the monarch population dropped below 30,000, the species would likely go extinct in the next few decades if nothing is done to save them.

Full Coverage: Science

Monarch butterflies lack state and federal legal protection to keep their habitat from being destroyed or degraded. In December, federal officials declared the monarch butterfly “a candidate” for threatened or endangered status but said no action would be taken for several years because of the many other species awaiting that designation.

The Xerces Society said it will keep pursuing protection for the monarch and work with a wide variety of partners “to implement science-based conservation actions urgently needed to help the iconic and beloved western monarch butterfly migration.”

People can help the colorful insects by planting early-blooming flowers and milkweed to fuel migrating monarchs on their paths to other states, the Xerces Society said."
'We can't wait:' Biden to push U.S. Congress for $1.9 trillion in COVID-19 relief,251,l464vj,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/we-cant-wait-biden-to-push-u-s-congress-for-1-9-trillion-in-covid-19-relief-idUSKBN29T0LO,114,1611546125.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Officials in President Joe Biden’s administration tried to head off Republican concerns that his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief proposal was too expensive on a Sunday call with Republican and Democratic lawmakers, some of whom pushed for a smaller plan targeting vaccine distribution.

Lawmakers from both parties said they had agreed that getting the COVID-19 vaccine to Americans should be a priority, but some Republicans objected to such a hefty package only a month after Congress passed a $900 billion relief measure.

“It seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope,” said Republican Senator Susan Collins, who was on the call with Brian Deese, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, and other top Biden aides.

Collins said she agreed additional funding was needed for vaccine distribution, but in a “more limited” bill, and planned to discuss such a measure with other lawmakers.

Senator Dick Durbin, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, said the call had shown that coronavirus relief was Biden’s top priority.

“We can’t wait,” White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. “Just because Washington has been gridlocked before doesn’t mean it needs to continue to be gridlocked.”

The White House did not provide a readout of the call, but Jared Bernstein, a member of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN afterward that the $900 billion in relief passed in late 2020 would only help for “a month or two.”

Biden, who took office on Wednesday, campaigned on a promise to take aggressive action on the pandemic, which his predecessor, President Donald Trump, often downplayed.

The Trump administration lagged far behind its target of 20 million Americans inoculated by the end of 2020 and left no plan for how to distribute the vaccine to millions of Americans, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on Sunday.

While Congress has already authorized $4 trillion to respond, the White House says the additional $1.9 trillion is needed to cover the costs of responding to the virus and provide enhanced jobless benefits and payments to households.

At least 16 senators and two House members - Democratic Representative Josh Gottheimer and Republican Tom Reed, co-chairmen of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus - participated in the call.

‘NATIONAL EMERGENCY’

“The bottom line is this: We’re in a national emergency, and we need to act like we’re in a national emergency,” Biden said on Friday before signing executive orders on economic relief.

Outlining his package earlier this month, Biden said that while enacting it would not come cheaply, “failure to do so will cost us dearly.”

Although Biden’s Democratic Party narrowly controls the House of Representatives and Senate, the legislation will likely need bipartisan support to become law.

Besides the price of the package, there is concern about a proposal to send $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, even some with fairly high incomes.

“The additional stimulus checks that the president is proposing are not well targeted,” Collins said in an emailed statement. She said, for example, that a family of five in her home state of Maine with an income in excess of $300,000, who would receive a partial check, was likely not suffering economic harm.

Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he would listen to the White House, but told “Fox News Sunday” that the $1.9 trillion figure was “shocking” and that borrowing large sums of money to fund the bill was not “the best thing” for the U.S. economy long term.

Senator Angus King, an independent who aligns with Democrats, said senators on the call had sought answers on how much of the $900 billion passed last month had been spent.

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer acknowledged remarks from some Republicans had not been positive, but voiced hope they would see the need after Sunday’s call.

“But if they don’t, there are tools we can use to move forward on our own. And we will,” Schumer told reporters in New York. He said those included “reconciliation,” which allows major legislation to pass the Senate on a simple majority.

Biden has said he wants to unify a divided country. Trump’s tenure drew to a close with his second impeachment by the House after supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in a deadly bid to overturn his election loss.

The push for coronavirus relief is complicated by Trump’s looming Senate impeachment, which not only threatens to deepen divisions between Democrats and Trump’s Republicans but could consume time that might be spent finalizing a package.

Senators said they hoped to pass legislation before the trial’s start during the week of Feb. 8."

Arizona Republicans passed resolutions on Saturday to censure three of the state's most prominent party leaders who have found themselves at odds with former President Donald Trump: Gov. Doug Ducey, former Sen. Jeff Flake and Cindy McCain, widow of late longtime Sen. John McCain.

The sweeping — yet essentially symbolic — rebuke took place during a meeting to figure out how to move forward after the state flipped blue in November, narrowly giving its 11 electoral votes to now-President Biden.

McCain and Flake, both of whom endorsed Biden for president, were censured for their outspoken opposition to Trump and for their support of globalist interests, according to state GOP members.

In condemning Ducey, the party cited the governor's decision to enact emergency orders during the coronavirus pandemic that the committee said are unconstitutional and ""restrict personal liberties.""

Much of the meeting, held indoors at Dream City Church in Phoenix, was largely a pep rally for state Republicans who support the former president and his baseless claims of election fraud.

State Republicans also reelected party chair Kelli Ward, an unwavering Trump supporter who had challenged Arizona's election results in a lawsuit that was rejected for insufficient evidence of fraud.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Ward called herself a ""Trump Republican"" who will ""always put America first, who believes in faith, family and freedom.""

""Yes, I will be radical about those things because those are the things that keep this country great,"" she said.

Rep. David Schweikert tried to rally Republicans to stop being disheartened by the election results and to continue voting in future elections. Before the pandemic hit, he said, conservative principles worked. ""The poor were getting less poor. Prosperity was spreading,"" he said.

""The Democrats are doing everything they can to erase the fact that we delivered good things for Americans; they delivered darkness,"" Schweikert added. ""We cannot let them. We are going to shine the light on them.""

Rep. Paul Gosar spent much of his time arguing that various voting machines used in the November election were susceptible to hacking. Gosar was one of the Republicans who challenged the certification of electoral votes on Jan. 6, moments before the U.S. Capitol was breached and overrun by Trump supporters.

Speakers also dismissed the idea that silencing Trump will stop the momentum of the 74 million Americans who voted for him.

""We will not cede the battlefield to Marxist totalitarians who want to destroy this country,"" Rep. Andy Biggs told the mostly maskless crowd, which responded with raucous applause. ""They want to abrogate your rights and destroy the Constitution of the United States. They want to take away your right to worship. They want to fight us and destroy us.""

Both Gosar and Biggs have been criticized by liberal groups for their role in allegedly inciting the Capitol riot.

In response to the censure, Ducey's political director, Sara Mueller, said in a statement, ""These resolutions are of no consequence whatsoever, and the people behind them have lost whatever little moral authority they may have once had.""

Likewise, McCain was unfazed by the vote.

""It is a high honor to be included in a group of Arizonans who have served our state and our nation so well...and who, like my late husband John, have been censured by the AZGOP,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""I'll wear this as a badge of honor."""
"Police arrest over 1,500 at Russia protests backing jailed Kremlin foe Navalny",421,l3gin6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny/police-arrest-over-1500-at-russia-protests-backing-jailed-kremlin-foe-navalny-idUSKBN29R10S,12,1611452036.0,,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Police detained more than 3,000 people and used force to break up rallies across Russia on Saturday as tens of thousands of protesters ignored extreme cold and police warnings to demand the release of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.

Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent he says was slipped to him by state security agents in August.

The authorities had warned people to stay away from Saturday’s demonstrations, saying they risked catching COVID-19 as well as prosecution and possible jail time for attending an unauthorised event.

But protesters defied the ban and, in at least one case in temperatures below -50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit), turned out in force. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, called on them to do the same next weekend to try to free Navalny from what he called “the clutches of his killers”.

In central Moscow, where Reuters reporters estimated up to 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans.

The authorities said just some 4,000 people had shown up, while the foreign ministry questioned Reuters crowd estimate.

“Why not just immediately say 4 million?” it suggested sarcastically on its official Telegram messenger channel.

Ivan Zhdanov, a Navalny ally, put turnout in the capital at 50,000, the Proekt media outlet reported.

Some protesters chanted “Putin is a thief”, and “Disgrace” and “Freedom to Navalny!”

U.S. CONDEMNS ‘HARSH TACTICS’

Navalny’s wife Yulia was briefly detained at the rally before being released. Some of Navalny’s political allies were detained in the days before the protest, others on the day itself.

At one point, protesters surrounded a sleek black car with a flashing light used by senior officials, throwing snowballs at it and kicking it. A group of policemen were also pelted with snowballs by a much bigger crowd.

The OVD-Info protest monitor group said that 3,435 people, including 1,360 in Moscow and 523 in St. Petersburg, had been detained at rallies in around 100 towns and cities.

The United States condemned what it described as “harsh tactics” used against protesters and journalists and called for Navalny’s “immediate and unconditional” release.

“We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights,” U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on Twitter that he deplored the authorities “disproportionate use of force”, while Britain’s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, condemned the “use of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists”.

Navalny, a 44-year-old lawyer, is in a Moscow prison pending the outcome of four legal matters he describes as trumped up. He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.

Some protesters marched on the prison, where police were waiting to arrest them.

Images of protesters with injuries such as bloodied heads circulated on social media.

The scenes were reminiscent of the months-long unrest in Russia’s neighbouring ally Belarus where anti-government protests flared last August over allegations of voter fraud.

One Moscow protester, Sergei Radchenko, 53, said: “I’m tired of being afraid. I haven’t just turned up for myself and Navalny, but for my son because there is no future in this country.”

‘PUTIN PALACE’

There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of “provocateurs”.

State prosecutors opened criminal cases into alleged violence against police officers by protesters.

In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people demonstrated against Navalny’s arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris.

Police in Siberia’s Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world, where the temperature was -52 Celsius (-62 F) on Saturday, grabbed a protester by his arms and legs and dragged him into a van, video footage showed.

In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy.

“Russian authorities arresting peaceful protesters, journalists,” spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on Twitter. “Appears to be a concerted campaign to suppress free speech, peaceful assembly.”

There were outages on mobile phone and internet services, the monitoring site downdetector.ru showed, a tactic sometimes used by authorities to make it harder for protesters to communicate among themselves.

In a push to galvanise support ahead of the protests, Navalny’s team released a video this week about an opulent palace on the Black Sea they alleged belonged to Putin, something the Kremlin denied. As of Saturday the video had been viewed more than 70 million times.

Navalny’s allies hope to tap into what polls say are pent-up frustrations among the public over years of falling wages and economic fallout from the pandemic.

But Putin’s grip on power looks unassailable for now and the 68-year-old president regularly records an approval rating of over 60%, much higher than that of Navalny."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial for Donald Trump over the Capitol riot will begin the week of Feb. 8, the first time a former president will face such charges after leaving office.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the schedule Friday evening after reaching an agreement with Republicans, who had pushed for a delay to give Trump a chance to organize his legal team and prepare a defense on the sole charge of incitement of insurrection.

The February start date also allows the Senate more time to confirm President Joe Biden’s Cabinet nominations and consider his proposed $1.9 trillion COVID relief package — top priorities of the new White House agenda that could become stalled during trial proceedings.

“We all want to put this awful chapter in our nation’s history behind us,” Schumer said about the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol siege by a mob of pro-Trump supporters.

“But healing and unity will only come if there is truth and accountability. And that is what this trial will provide.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment late Monday, with senators sworn in as jurors Tuesday. But opening arguments will move to February.

Trump’s impeachment trial would be the first of a U.S. president no longer in office, an undertaking that his Senate Republican allies argue is pointless, and potentially even unconstitutional. Democrats say they have to hold Trump to account, even as they pursue Biden’s legislative priorities, because of the gravity of what took place — a violent attack on the U.S. Congress aimed at overturning an election.

If Trump is convicted, the Senate could vote to bar him from holding office ever again, potentially upending his chances for a political comeback.

The urgency for Democrats to hold Trump responsible was complicated by the need to put Biden’s government in place and start quick work on his coronavirus aid package.

“The more time we have to get up and running ... the better,” Biden said Friday in brief comments to reporters.

Republicans were eager to delay the trial, putting distance between the shocking events of the siege and the votes that will test their loyalty to the former president who still commands voters’ attention.

Negotiations between Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were complicated, as the two are also in talks over a power-sharing agreement for the Senate, which is split 50-50 but in Democratic control because Vice President Kamala Harris serves as a tie-breaking vote.

McConnell had proposed delaying the start and welcomed the agreement.

“Republicans set out to ensure the Senate’s next steps will respect former President Trump’s rights and due process, the institution of the Senate, and the office of the presidency,” said McConnell spokesman Doug Andres. “That goal has been achieved.”

Pelosi said Friday the nine House impeachment managers, or prosecutors, are “ready to begin to make their case” against Trump. Trump’s team will have had the same amount of time since the House impeachment vote to prepare, Pelosi said.

Democrats say they can move quickly through the trial, potentially with no witnesses, because lawmakers experienced the insurrection first-hand.

One of the managers, California Rep. Ted Lieu, said Friday that Democrats would rather be working on policy right now, but “we can’t just ignore” what happened on Jan. 6.

“This was an attack on our Capitol by a violent mob,” Lieu said in an interview with The Associated Press. “It was an attack on our nation instigated by our commander in chief. We have to address that and make sure it never happens again.”

Trump, who told his supporters to “fight like hell” just before they invaded the Capitol two weeks ago and interrupted the electoral vote count, is still assembling his legal team.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday deferred to Congress on timing for the trial and would not say whether Biden thinks Trump should be convicted. But she said lawmakers can simultaneously discuss and have hearings on Biden’s coronavirus relief package.

“We don’t think it can be delayed or it can wait, so they’re going to have to find a path forward,” Psaki said of the virus aid. “He’s confident they can do that.”

Democrats would need the support of at least 17 Republicans to convict Trump, a high bar. While most Republican senators condemned Trump’s actions that day, far fewer appear to be ready to convict.

A handful of Senate Republicans have indicated they are open — but not committed — to conviction. But most have come to Trump’s defense as it relates to impeachment, saying they believe a trial will be divisive and questioning the legality of trying a president after he has left office.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally who has been helping him find lawyers, said Friday there is “a very compelling constitutional case” on whether Trump can be impeached after his term — an assertion Democrats reject, saying there is ample legal precedent. Graham also suggested Republicans will argue Trump’s words on Jan. 6 were not legally “incitement.”

“On the facts, they’ll be able to mount a defense, so the main thing is to give him a chance to prepare and run the trial orderly, and hopefully the Senate will reject the idea of pursuing presidents after they leave office,” Graham said.

Other Republicans had stronger words, suggesting there should be no trial at all. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said Pelosi is sending a message to Biden that “my hatred and vitriol of Donald Trump is so strong that I will stop even you and your Cabinet from getting anything done.” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson suggested Democrats are choosing “vindictiveness” over national security as Biden attempts to set up his government.

McConnell, who said this week that Trump “provoked” his supporters before the riot, has not said how he will vote. He said Senate Republicans “strongly believe we need a full and fair process where the former president can mount a defense and the Senate can properly consider the factual, legal and constitutional questions.”

Trump, the first president to be impeached twice, is at a disadvantage compared with his first impeachment trial, in which he had the full resources of the White House counsel’s office to defend him. Graham helped Trump hire South Carolina attorney Butch Bowers after members of his past legal teams indicated they did not plan to join the new effort.

Why Are Conservatives So Angry Biden Denounced White Supremacy?,85,l2sdhm,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/01/why-are-conservatives-angry-biden-denounced-white-supremacy.html,78,1611365041.0,,"Photo: Joshua Roberts/Pool/Getty Images

The themes and rhetoric of President Biden’s Inaugural Address — in a departure from his predecessor’s odd decision to channel comic-book villain dialogue but a continuation of the choices used by normal presidents — were a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Biden praised the American spirit, called for unity, reminded his audience of our common history of overcoming challenges, promised to represent all Americans, and so on.

Whether or not one found this inspiring is a matter of personal taste. What’s interesting is that certain quarters of the right found the speech actually objectionable. The portion of the speech that rankled was Biden’s renunciation of racism and violent white-supremacist terrorism.

“If you read his speech and listen to it carefully, much of it is thinly veiled innuendo calling us white supremacists, calling us racists,” protested Rand Paul on Fox News. “It’s an odd way to seek national unity: Call a significant portion of the American public white supremacists, racists, and nativists,” complained Manhattan Institute scholar Heather MacDonald. Tucker Carlson devoted an entire segment to angrily denouncing Biden for opposing white supremacy, which he interpreted, not unreasonably, as a veiled criticism of himself and his most fervent supporters.

None of these right-wingers self-identify as racist or white supremacist. And at no point did Biden say, or even imply, that all — or even most — Trump supporters are racist. Why, then, do they object to a fairly rote denunciation of ideas they claim to abhor themselves?

To understand why it rankled them, you should start with Biden’s reasons for including an attack on white supremacy in the first place. From Biden’s standpoint, he needed to do this in order to contextualize his call for “unity.” Historically, unity has been used as a device to encourage white Americans to come together while ignoring racism. The basis for the post-Reconstruction healing of the regional and partisan split was that white northern Republicans withdrew their protection for freed slaves and allowed white Southerners to violently repress and disenfranchise black people. That sub rosa agreement became the foundation for the century-long period of depolarized politics that ran from the end of Reconstruction through the civil-rights era, which triggered its demise.

Black Americans have particular cause for suspicion of “unity” as a transcendent value. (Biden himself has inadvertently articulated their reasons for questioning the old, bipartisan era when he touted his history of making deals with segregationists.) Biden’s explicit renunciation of racism and white-supremacist terror was a way of clarifying that his idea of unity would exclude, rather than include, racism.

Then, of course, there was the recent insurrection by a mob that, if not white supremacist in toto, was led by a militant white-supremacist vanguard. Biden is attempting to define a (small-d) democratic order that excludes a violent authoritarian faction that refuses to accept political equality for fellow citizens.

And that is what makes Biden’s statement an implicit rebuke to Trump and his fans. One of the most significant realignments of the Trump era was an extension of the Republican coalition to the more distant edges of the far right. As early as 2015, observers like Evan Osnos recognized that Trump had activated Nazis and Nazi-like white supremacists. (Ron Paul, Rand’s father and formative influence, was a precursor in bringing these fringe groups into his coalition.) Trump’s presidency inspired extremists, and brought into existence new ones, like the Proud Boys and QAnon.

Biden is implicitly demanding Republicans renounce those fringe groups. That’s what makes his speech so offensive to Trump enthusiasts. Carlson, indeed, all but admits that his refusal to denounce right-wing extremists is the hangup. In his segment on Biden’s speech, he said:

Other channels fill their air with attacks on the Proud Boys, whoever they are, or QAnon enthusiasts or gun owners in central Pennsylvania who fix air conditioning for a living and tend to vote the wrong way. They go after those people, and you can see why…. Attacking those people isn’t hard. None of them have real power.

Whether or not they have “real power,” they did overpower the security at the U.S. Capitol, occupy the Congress, get a lot of people injured or killed, and scare the entire country. If they were totally powerless, Trump and Carlson would be happy to renounce the far right. They won’t, because they value its small but energetic contribution to their audience and movement.

Carlson, MacDonald and Paul heard Biden denounce white supremacy, and decided he was talking about them. That’s a choice they made, and it says more about them than it does about Biden."
"Top Iran leader posts Trump-like golfer image, vows revenge",0,l2n4cb,https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29R0DE?__twitter_impression=true,4,1611348772.0,,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Twitter account of Iran's Supreme Leader on Friday carried the image of a golfer resembling former President Donald Trump apparently being targeted by a drone, vowing revenge over the killing of a top Iranian general in a U.S. drone attack.

The post carried the text of remarks by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in December, in which he said ""Revenge is certain"", renewing a vow of vengeance ahead of the first anniversary of the killing of top military commander General Qassem Soleimani in the attack in Iraq.

""Those who ordered the murder of General Soleimani as well as those who carried this out should be punished. This revenge will certainly happen at the right time,"" Khamenei tweeted on December 16, without naming Trump, who had ordered the strike.

Earlier this month, Twitter removed a tweet by Khamenei in which he said U.S. and British-made vaccines were unreliable and may be intended to ""contaminate other nations"". The platform said the tweet violated its rules against misinformation.

There was no apparent immediate action by Twitter over the Persian-language tweet on Friday by Khamenei, Iran's highest authority. (here)

Tensions rapidly grew between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when Trump exited a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers that sought to curb Tehran's nuclear programme. Washington reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy.

Iran called for action and ""not just words"" shortly after Joe Biden was sworn in as U.S. president on Wednesday. Biden has said Washington will rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran resumes strict compliance."
"Biden Orders Sweeping Assessment of Russian Hacking, Even While Renewing Nuclear Treaty",459,l2p0xz,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/us/politics/biden-russia-cyber-hack-nuclear.html,23,1611355170.0,,"Taken together, the paired announcements make clear the complexity of Mr. Biden’s two-step approach to contain the actions of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Biden’s aides have said they have no interest in a “reset” in relations of the kind that President Barack Obama and his secretary of state at the time, Hillary Clinton, tried a dozen years ago.

But that puts Mr. Biden in the awkward position of seeking to extend the nuclear treaty — which Mr. Putin has already said he is willing to renew — while very publicly discussing the need to make Russia pay a price for the hacking. He has few alternatives: If the treaty is not extended, both countries would be free to deploy as many nuclear weapons as they want starting Feb. 6.

But Mr. Biden’s aides have privately cautioned that his options for retaliation in response to the attack on the “supply chain” of software used by the government and private industry are limited. In part because the evidence amassed so far suggested the Russians used their covert access chiefly to conduct espionage — something that all nations engage in and that the United States conducts against Russia all of the time, often through software manipulation.

Mr. Biden’s order for a study of the SolarWinds hacking — named for the Texas company whose widely used network management software was one way Russian hackers gained access — comes as intelligence officials have quietly concluded that more than a thousand Russian software engineers were most likely involved in it, according to people involved in the investigation.

That suggests it was a far larger and stealthier operation than first known — and raises anew questions about why the National Security Agency and its military counterpart, United States Cyber Command, missed it. The Russians were active for nine months in those networks before a cybersecurity firm, FireEye, and Microsoft Corporation alerted the government, and then the public, about the hacking."
'We feel incredibly betrayed': Thousands of Guardsmen forced to vacate Capitol,2,l2e32o,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/21/national-guard-troops-vacate-capitol-461220,7,1611311758.0,,"POLITICO obtained photos showing the Guard members packed together in the parking garage, sleeping on the ground.

All National Guard troops were told to vacate the Capitol and nearby congressional buildings on Thursday, and to set up mobile command centers outside or in nearby hotels, another Guardsman confirmed. They were told to take their rest breaks during their 12-hour shifts outside and in parking garages, the person said.

Top lawmakers from both parties took to Twitter to decry the decision and call for answers after POLITICO first reported the news Thursday night, with some even offering their offices to be used as rest areas. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) tweeted: “If this is true, it's outrageous. I will get to the bottom of this.” And Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) noted that the Capitol complex remains closed to members of the public, “so there’s plenty of room for troops to take a break in them.”

By 10 p.m., Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said the situation was “being resolved” and that the Guardsmen would be able to return indoors later in the night.

“Just made a number of calls and have been informed Capitol Police have apologized to the Guardsmen and they will be allowed back into the complex tonight,” added Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who lost both of her legs in combat. “I’ll keep checking to make sure they are.”

A Guard source confirmed late Thursday night that all troops in the parking garages were ordered to return inside the Capitol.

Brig. Gen. Janeen Birckhead, the Guard’s Inauguration Task Force commander, confirmed in a statement to POLITICO shortly after midnight that the troops were out of the garage and back into the Capitol building as authorized by the Capitol Police Watch Commander. They will take their breaks near Emancipation Hall going forward.

In a statement, Capitol Police spokesperson Eva Malecki said the department recently asked that troops’ shifts be reduced from 12 hours to eight in order to allow for additional rest hours away from the Capitol complex. The statement did not explain why the Guardsmen were forced into parking garages.

On Friday morning, Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman insisted in a statement that the department “did not instruct the National Guard to vacate the Capitol Building facilities.”

“The Department is also working with the Guard to reduce the need for sleeping accommodations by establishing shorter shifts, and will ensure they have access to the comfortable accommodations they absolutely deserve when the need arises,” Pittman added.

Guardsmen who spoke with POLITICO were not given a clear reason why they were asked to vacate the buildings. The first Guardsman said it may have been due to a complaint that some troops were not wearing masks, but denied that was the case.

“We have strict guidance that masks are to be worn at all times unless soldiers are eating and drinking,” the Guardsman said.

Capitol Police asked troops to move their rest area on Thursday, said Guard spokesperson Maj. Matt Murphy.

“As Congress is in session and increased foot traffic and business is being conducted, Capitol Police asked the troops to move their rest area,” Murphy said. “They were temporarily relocated to the Thurgood Marshall Judicial Center garage with heat and restroom facilities. We remain an agile and flexible force to provide for the safety and security of the Capitol and its surrounding areas.”

Guard leadership did not make the decision and are “doing their best to provide rest shelter for troops who are still on 12-hour shifts protecting the Capitol and congressional grounds,” the second Guardsman said.

“There really may be an important reason for us to vacate and it just hasn’t been well communicated yet,” the second Guardsman said.

The troops are particularly concerned about being packed in tight quarters with limited bathroom access during a pandemic. At least 100 Guardsmen have tested positive for Covid-19, according to two Guardsmen. Some are quarantining in hotels.

A spokesperson previously declined to provide a specific number for troops who have tested positive for the virus.

After images went viral last week of troops sleeping on the floor in the halls of Congress, Guardsmen protecting the Capitol were initially provided cots, POLITICO first reported.

Thousands of troops have already left Washington after around 25,000 were called to D.C. to help defend it from potential threats ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday."

WASHINGTON (AP) — With a burst of executive orders, President Joe Biden served notice Thursday that America’s war on COVID-19 is under new command, promising an anxious nation progress to reduce infections and lift the siege it has endured for nearly a year.

At the same time, he tried to manage expectations in his second day in office, saying despite the best intentions “we’re going to face setbacks.” He brushed off a reporter’s question on whether his goal of 100 million coronavirus shots in 100 days should be more ambitious, a point pressed by some public health experts.

The 10 orders signed by Biden are aimed at jump starting his national COVID-19 strategy to increase vaccinations and testing, lay the groundwork for reopening schools and businesses, and immediately increase the use of masks — including a requirement that Americans mask up for travel. One directive calls for addressing health care inequities in minority communities hard hit by the virus.

“We didn’t get into this mess overnight, and it will take months to turn this around,” Biden said at the White House. U.S. deaths have have surged past 400,000, and he noted projections that they could reach 500,000 in a month.

But then, looking directly into the TV camera, Biden declared: “To a nation waiting for action, let me be clear on this point: Help is on the way.”

The new president has vowed to take far more aggressive measures to contain the virus than his predecessor, starting with stringent adherence to public health guidance. A key difference is that under Biden, the federal government is assuming full responsibility for the COVID response. And instead of delegating major tasks to states, he is offering to help them with technical backup and federal money.

He faces steep obstacles, with the virus actively spreading in most states, vaccine shortages, slow progress on distribution and political uncertainty over whether congressional Republicans will help him pass a $1.9 trillion economic relief and COVID response package.

Adding to the challenges are virus mutations, particularly one that has emerged in South Africa, that may make vaccines somewhat less effective. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters at the White House briefing that “we are paying very close attention to it.” Biden’s plan includes an expansion of research capabilities to map out the genetic structure of new variants.

On Thursday a group influential with Republican office holders lent its support to the president’s strategy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said, “We support the new administration’s focus on removing roadblocks to vaccinations and reopening schools, both of which are important steps to accelerating a broad-based economic recovery for all Americans.”

Biden officials have said they’ve been hampered by a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration during the transition. They say they don’t have a complete understanding of their predecessors’ actions on vaccine distribution. And they face a litany of complaints from states that say they are not getting enough vaccine even as they are being asked to vaccinate more categories of people.

Biden’s mask order for travel applies to airports and planes, ships, intercity buses, trains and public transportation. Travelers from abroad must furnish a negative COVID-19 test before departing for the U.S. and must quarantine upon arrival. Biden has already mandated masks on federal property.

Although airlines, Amtrak and other transport providers now require masks, Biden’s order makes it a federal mandate, leaving little wiggle room for passengers tempted to argue about their rights. The action was applauded by airline unions and supported by a major industry trade group.

It marks a sharp break with the culture of President Donald Trump’s administration, under which masks were optional, and Trump made a point of going maskless and hosting big gatherings of like-minded supporters. Science has shown that masks, properly worn, cut down on coronavirus transmission.

Biden said his administration’s coronavirus decisions would be based on science, not politics.

Biden is seeking to expand testing and vaccine availability, with the goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office . But some independent experts say his administration should strive for two or three times that number. Even with the slow pace of vaccinations, the U.S. is already closing in on 1 million shots a day.

“It’s a disappointingly low bar,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.

Asked about that at the White House on Thursday, Biden told a reporter: “When I announced it, you all said it’s not possible. Come on, give me a break, man.”

Fauci told reporters the U.S. could return to “a degree of normality” by the fall if the vaccination campaign goes well. Achieving widespread or “herd” immunity would require vaccinating as many as 280 million people.

Biden has directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to begin setting up vaccination centers, aiming to have 100 up and running in a month. He’s ordering the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin a program to make vaccines available through local pharmacies starting next month, building on a plan devised by the Trump administration. And he’s launching an effort to train more people to administer shots.

Biden has set a goal of having most K-8 schools reopen in his first 100 days, and he’s ordering the departments of Education and Health and Human Services to provide clear guidance for reopening them safely. States would also be able to tap FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund to help get schools back open.

Getting schools and child care going will help ease the drag on the U.S. economy, making it easier for parents to return to their jobs and for restaurants to find lunch-time customers.

But administration officials stressed that reopening schools safely depends on increased testing.

Biden is giving government agencies a green light to use the Cold War-era Defense Production Act . It allows the government to direct private industry to produce supplies needed in times of national emergency. In this case it could be anything from swabs, to masks, to certain chemicals.

“We do not have nearly enough testing capacity in this country,” said White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients.

The Biden plan estimates that a national vaccination strategy with expanded testing requires $160 billion, and he wants an additional $170 billion to aid the reopening of schools and universities.

As part of his strategy, Biden ordered establishment of a Health Equity Task Force to ensure that minority and underserved communities are not left out of the government’s response. Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans have borne a heavy burden of death and disease from the virus. Surveys have shown vaccine hesitancy is higher among African Americans, a problem the administration plans to address through an education campaign.

At least eight people were arrested in Portland on Wednesday after rioters damaged both federal and private property, police said.

Dozens of protesters took to the streets of Oregon's largest city following the inauguration of President Joe Biden. Some people were seen carrying Black Lives Matter signs, while others held banners with anti-Biden or anti-police slogans.

Although the demonstrations were largely peaceful, two protest events resulted in property damage and arrests, according to the Portland Police Bureau.

A crowd of about 150 people gathered at Revolution Hall, a music venue in southeast Portland, and marched to the headquarters of the Democratic Party of Oregon on Wednesday afternoon. Some individuals vandalized the building with graffiti and smashed windows, while others moved dumpsters into the middle of the street and lit the contents on fire, police said.

Eight people, ranging in age from 18 to 38, were arrested in connection with the event. The charges range from felony criminal mischief to possession of a destructive device. Various weapons were also seized, including Molotov cocktails, knives, batons, chemical spray and a crow bar, according to police.

Later that evening, a group of about 150 people marched to the Portland field office of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Some individuals in the crowd were seen carrying pepper ball guns, electronic control weapons similar to Tasers, large fireworks, shields and rocks. Many were also wearing helmets and gas masks, police said.

Within minutes of arriving at the ICE facility, some people began throwing rocks and eggs at the building while others applied graffiti. Federal law enforcement officers responded by launching ""crowd control munitions,"" while Portland police officers ""were standing by to address crimes in the surrounding neighborhood,"" according to police.

""Details about what munitions were used, and any arrests made, will have to come from federal law enforcement,"" Sgt. Kevin Allen of the Portland Police Bureau said in a statement early Thursday. ""Portland Police did not deploy any CS gas.""

ABC News has reached out to the ICE Office of Public Affairs for comment.

""As always, we appreciate those who made your voices heard without resorting to criminal activity,"" Allen added. ""We respect the rights of free speech and assembly."""
"COVID Lockdowns Have No Clear Benefit vs Other Voluntary Measures, International Study Shows",0,l23pnt,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/covid-lockdowns-have-no-clear-benefit-vs-other-voluntary-measures-international-study-shows/ar-BB1cKOmJ,4,1611280535.0,,"A new study evaluating COVID-19 responses around the world found that mandatory lockdown orders early in the pandemic did not provide significantly more benefits to slowing the spread of the disease than other voluntary measures, such as social distancing or travel reduction.

© JUSTIN TALLIS/Getty A new study shows that mandatory lockdown orders may not provide more significant benefits to curbing the spread of COVID-19 vs voluntary measures such as social distancing and travel restrictions. Here, one pedestrian walks on the pavement in central London in the morning on March 24, 2020 after Britain ordered a lockdown.

The peer reviewed study, which was conducted by a group of Stanford researchers and published in the Wiley Online Library on January 5, analyzed coronavirus case growth in 10 countries in early 2020.

The study compared cases in England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the U.S. – all countries that implemented mandatory lockdown orders and business closures – to South Korea and Sweden, which implemented less severe, voluntary responses. It aimed to analyze the effect that less restrictive or more restrictive measures had on changing individual behavior and curbing the transmission of the virus.

The researchers used a mathematical model that subtracted ""the sum of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) effects and epidemic dynamics in countries that did not enact more restrictive non-pharmaceutical interventions (mrNPIs) from the sum of NPI effects and epidemic dynamics in countries that did.""

Using that model, the researchers determined that there is ""no clear, significant beneficial effect of [more restrictive measures] on case growth in any country.""

""Implementing any NPIs was associated with significant reductions in case growth in 9 out of 10 study countries, including South Korea and Sweden that implemented only lrNPIs [less restrictive NPIs] (Spain had a non‐significant effect). After subtracting the epidemic and lrNPI effects, we find no clear, significant beneficial effect of mrNPIs on case growth in any country,"" the study said.

""We do not question the role of all public health interventions, or of coordinated communications about the epidemic, but we fail to find an additional benefit of stay-at-home orders and business closures,"" the research added.

The efficacy of lockdown orders has been a hotly debated topic since the start of the pandemic.

Though this study's approach did not determine any significant benefits to implementing mandatory lockdowns, others have shown that lockdowns have saved millions of lives.

A study published by researchers at Imperial College London in June found that some 3.1 million deaths had been averted due to lockdowns across Europe early on in the pandemic, Reuters reported. Additional research found that 530 million coronavirus infections had been avoided due to early lockdowns in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States, according to the news outlet.

Across the United States, mandatory lockdown orders have been a highly politicized issue.

Some Republican leaders, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, have vehemently opposed state or nationwide closures to curb the spread of COVID-19. In Democratic states, including New York and California, lockdown orders have been a consistent part of the coronavirus response since March.

According to a poll released by Vox and Data for Progress on December 24, more than half of Americans said they would support a nationwide lockdown for one month.

But President-elect Joe Biden said in an interview in November that he had no intention of implementing a national shutdown when he takes office on January 20.

""I'm not going to shut down the economy. I'm going to shut down the virus,"" Biden said. ""There is no circumstance which I can see that would require a total national shutdown. I think that would be counterproductive.""

As of Thursday, the United States had recorded over 23 million cases, and 385,178 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University.

"Biden administration promises an EV era, new world for the auto industry",43,l217bo,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/joe-biden-administration-ev-autos-transportation-infrastructure/,8,1611273591.0,,"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

At 12 p.m. ET on Jan. 20, Joe Biden was officially sworn in as the 46th President of the United States. With the newly minted administration, Biden now has the power to iron out and execute big changes for the automotive industry, transportation ecosystems and the overall US infrastructure. Here's what we can expect from Biden as he enters office.

Electric vehicles for the masses

During his campaign, Biden called for policy and investment changes to usher in a new era for American automakers -- one they're already starting to embrace. It starts with shifting personal transportation from cars powered solely by gas engines to a future where batteries and electric motors do the heavy lifting.

According to the policy Biden laid out during his campaign, his administration aims to restore the full federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, though we'll likely see other changes to the program along the way. In addition to giving automakers like General Motors and Tesla tax credits once again -- the two exhausted theirs at the start of 2020 -- the Biden administration will also pursue direct-consumer rebates to encourage American car buyers to swap out fossil-fuel-powered cars for zero-emission vehicles.

However, Biden wants the federal government to set an example. As part of the administration's Buy American campaign, Biden plans to include new government fleet vehicle purchases in a $400 billion procurement investment for American-made goods. This should encourage US businesses to adopt electric fleet vehicles, as well, and will include a proposal to convert all 500,000 US school buses to battery power by the end of this decade.

EV charging infrastructure

To complement a policy that champions EVs, Biden in the past called for a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers. According to the Biden campaign's estimates last year, this EV charging infrastructure would span the nation and allow any American to travel coast-to-coast in an EV by 2030.

Thus far, charging infrastructure funds came in the form of investments from businesses, occasionally supported by automakers themselves. With federal backing, electric vehicles will have a friend in the Biden administration. Perhaps most crucially, it's just as automakers begin to seriously give their vehicle portfolios electrified makeovers.

R&D investments into batteries and other technologies

Biden's Build Back Better plan targets aggressive federal research and development investments, and the automotive sector won't be left out. On his website, the president calls for a $300 billion investment into R&D spanning ""electric vehicle technology to lightweight materials, to 5G and artificial intelligence -- to unleash high-quality job creation in high-value manufacturing and technology.""

Specifically, $5 billion over five years in this proposed investment is meant for battery and energy storage ""that can boost the range and slash the price of electric cars,"" according to Biden's website.

Automotive manufacturing

The president spoke at length last year about ensuring the US auto industry thrives under his watch, and specific parts of a proposed, revamped tax code will reward automakers for making cars in America. A 10% advanceable tax credit is proposed for companies making investments that will create jobs for US workers -- for example, ""An auto company that retools an existing factory to produce next-generation electric vehicles,"" the Biden campaign website says. Additional grants and funding for carmakers looking to retool factories and invest in US manufacturing are also possible as Biden aims to create one million new jobs across the auto industry, including manufacturing, supply chain and infrastructure.

An overhaul to emissions and fuel economy standards

The Trump administration finalized new federal emissions and fuel economy regulations in 2020, but the Biden administration will more than likely seek to beef them up once again. Automakers have already started calling on the new administration to use a voluntary California agreement as a framework for a national standard. The voluntary California agreement worked out to fuel efficiency increases of 3.7% each year starting in 2022 -- lower than the Obama administration's goal, but far more aggressive than the Trump administration's.

On his campaign website, Biden called for an overhaul to the Clean Air Act signed into law decades ago and even included mention of all vehicles sold in the US to feature some form of electrification. A reminder that ""electrification"" does not boil down to only battery-electric vehicles -- instead, it includes everything from a mild-hybrid with a 48-volt motor-generator all the way to a full-blown EV. Each piece also intertwines the new administration's goal to aggressively tackle the ongoing climate change crisis.

Futuristic infrastructure and expanded transportation

In the here-and-now, President Biden aims to make major investments in the US infrastructure, which may amount to a proposed $2 trillion investment in his first term. Specifically, $50 billion will be earmarked in the Biden administration's first year to directly support road and highway repairs in all 50 states.

However, the president also said he will instruct the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy to work together to investigate and move forward the idea of ""complete streets."" The campaign defined these streets as ""designed to help drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and others safely share the road."" They may also prepare the US for the future of self-driving cars. In addition to ""complete streets,"" infrastructure investments may also move to include testing for new types of EV charging technologies, such as roads that charge EVs while they move. It's a far-out technology, for sure, but expanded federal investment to spur innovation was a hallmark to Biden's campaign. To further provide a boost to smart infrastructure and planning, Biden previously called for a $1 billion competitive grant program for the ongoing Smart Cities Challenge.

Perhaps the largest takeaway from Biden's words on transportation at-large is a push to finally provide high-speed rail to US citizens. The 46th president's relationship with Amtrak is well known, after all. Outside of rail, there will be a general push for different modes of transportation as the administration realizes there are other more efficient ways for people to move within an area. One concrete goal calls for Americans in municipalities of more than 100,000 people to have access to ""quality public transportation"" by 2030."
Tarnished by Trump: National security officials struggle to find new jobs,409,l20t6h,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/08/post-trump-jobs-national-security-456180,75,1611272390.0,,"POLITICO Dispatch: January 8 As lawmakers call for President Trump's removal from office after Wednesday's violent attempted coup, Trump is surrounding himself with an increasingly small circle of advisers.

Officials working in national security are particularly vulnerable to this challenge. Many are tied to controversial Trump policies and scandals, be it child separation at the border or the politicization of the military on display when top Pentagon leaders stood with Trump for a photo op after authorities forcefully cleared Lafayette Square of protesters.

In some cases, the resistance that officials are meeting from would-be employers is extreme. One senior defense official, who has been looking for a new job for two years without luck, recalled a conversation in which they were told that they were considered part of the ""Hitler Youth.”

“That attitude is not helpful,” the person said.

The senior defense official broadly described a sense of “Trump administration animus” from potential outside employers, which is frustrating for officials who don't consider themselves ""hardcore MAGA folks.”

During her own job search this summer, Troye was told directly by one potential employer that they could not offer her a job because she was a “liability.”

“I can’t tell you how hurtful it was to hear that,” said Troye, noting that the incident was a reality check.

National security jobs are more difficult to get than most, as applicants need a security clearance and a specialized set of skills.

A career civilian rather than a political nominee, Troye said she took the White House job to “make a difference,” and fought against policies she thought were wrong. Yet the incident with the employer “showed me firsthand the repercussions of trying to navigate in that space,” she said.

Elizabeth Neumann, another former civil servant and Homeland Security official who worked on counterterrorism, said she did not directly face challenges in finding a new job after she resigned in April. But that was primarily because she immediately spoke out against Trump’s policies.

Still, she recounted several instances during her job hunt in which she heard through her network that certain companies would never consider hiring her because she worked in the Trump administration.

While junior-level employees working on noncontroversial issues might not have problems finding new employment, anyone associated with controversial Trump policies, such as immigration, were blacklisted, Neumann said.

“There is absolutely an effect of a number of organizations out there trying to blacklist anybody that worked on child separation,"" for example, Neumann said.

Other former officials say they have heard from many former colleagues struggling to find work after Jan. 20. While more senior officials may have strong networks and won’t have much trouble finding employment, the younger officials who have limited experience and no previous reputation are challenged, said one former defense official.

“Some of these people are really smart, good and hardworking, but they are also strong Trump supporters, which is off-putting to many in the think tank community of D.C.,” the person said. “I think it’s going to be a rough few months for people.”

Another senior administration official looking for a new job compared the challenges Trump appointees will face to the backlash against George W. Bush officials. The person previously turned down a senior White House position, foreseeing that people who worked directly for Trump would be further challenged to find outside employment.

“Headhunters told me that talented people will get hired, it’s just going to be a matter of how many talented people there are,” the person said.

But many Trump appointees who are now struggling to find jobs — everyone from junior staffers to Cabinet secretaries — are facing questions for not leaving sooner. Many of these officials are the same people who privately bemoaned Trump’s instability, but were “all too willing to enable it,” said another former senior official.

“They are finding that staying silent had a cost: to their consciences and to their careers,” the person said. “People knew Trump would be toxic, yet they hedged anyway in hopes that they might get four more years of job stability.”

Others defended their gut-wrenching decision to stay on as long as they did, recalling that they were torn between trying to prevent the president from doing further damage, and taking a stand as an outsider.

Ultimately, Troye got to the point where she felt she was no longer making a difference and had to make a “moral decision,” she said.

But her decision has been a double-edged sword. Not only does she have the “baggage” of working for the Trump administration, she is also a whistleblower. She is concerned that future employers will not see her as someone to be trusted because of her decision to speak out.

“To some people you are a hero, to many you are a traitor,” Troye said."
Voting Machine Company Threatens Researchers for Exposing Valid Security Flaws,273,l1lx45,https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an7kj/election-hardware-vendor-threatens-researchers-for-exposing-valid-security-flaws,60,1611215489.0,,"A major manufacturer of voting machine hardware has threatened researchers for highlighting proven privacy and security vulnerabilities in their products.

But many experts, including Princeton University professor Andrew Appel, say the accusations and criticism levied against ES&S are absolutely correct.

“The ExpressVote XL, if hacked, can add, delete, or change votes on individual ballots — and no voting machine is immune from hacking,” Appel said. “That’s why optical-scan voting machines are the way to go, because they can’t change what’s printed on the ballot. And let me explain some more: The ExpressVote XL, if adopted, will deteriorate our security and our ability to have confidence in our elections, and indeed it is a bad voting machine. And expensive, too!”

Election security experts, integrity advocates, and experts have spent the better part of the last few decades warning local and state election officials about the dangers of touch-screen voting machines. The installation of fraudulent vote-stealing software, they’ve warned, can undermine democracy in an undetectable, uncorrectable way that’s easily avoided.



That hasn’t stopped officials from embracing such solutions anyway, usually doling out massive, lucrative contracts to a handful of powerful companies that routinely find themselves above meaningful scrutiny and the law. When experts and researchers point out the lack of robust security in such devices, lawsuits and threats are frequently their reward.

Such threats often work. In May of last year, the New York State Board of Elections halted certification of the ExpressVote XL over concerns that state regulations might not allow for its use. After ES&S threatened to sue the board, it capitulated and is now prepared to certify the device for use against the warnings of experts.



But detailed research on several fronts shows how the ExpressVote XL software could theoretically be modified to change votes if successfully hacked, without voters ever noticing. And states like Pennsylvania that recently purchased the machines say their first experience with the devices was “marred by miscounted vote tallies” in some counties.



While the general consensus among security researchers is that the 2020 election went smoothly, this success was largely thanks to researchers and experts who diligently exposed system vulnerabilities and shortcomings in a quest for transparency and accountability, and in some cases, a paper trail election officials can rely on and that couldn't be hacked. Georgia's close election, for example, recounted its 5 million votes by hand, ensuring the results were valid despite an unprecedented attack on election officials by the President of the United States.

The President's attacks on the democratic process are of course making an already difficult issue more confusing than it needs to be. Dominion Voting Systems, another major voting systems vendor, is currently suing Donald Trump's lawyer Sidney Powell for $1.3 billion for baselessly accusing the company of stealing the election from Trump.

Any voting systems company is right to push back against wild and misleading accusations, but another side effect of Trump's destructive attempt to steal the election here is that it muddies the waters around the very legitimate and critical work of election security experts who are trying to find real flaws with our voting systems."

Giving his inaugural address outside the Capitol building earlier, Mr Biden stressed that last November's election result was fair - declaring: ""This is democracy's day. The will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.

""We've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and at this hour my friends, democracy has prevailed.""

Mr Biden promised to ""press forward with speed and urgency"" during a ""winter of peril"" to tackle the ""once-in-a-century virus that silently stalks the country"" - and also vowed to confront white supremacy and terrorism.

He said his prevailing focus will now be on ""uniting our nation"", adding: ""With unity, we can do great things, important things - we can right wrongs.""

In an apparent snub to Mr Trump, he said he wanted to ""make America once again a leading force for good in the world"" - continuing: ""Let's start afresh... all of us.""

Mr Biden urged people to ""join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature"", and said without unity there will be ""no nation, only a state of chaos"".

He is the first outgoing president since 1869 to skip an inauguration ceremony, though departing vice president Mike Pence was in the audience, representing the outgoing administration.

Mr Trump gave a parting message before boarding Air Force One, telling a small group of supporters and family members gathered on the tarmac of Joint Base Andrews that ""we will be back in some form"".

""I wish the new administration great luck and great success,"" he added, before boarding the plane, which took off to the booming soundtrack of Frank Sinatra's My Way.

After the inauguration, Mr Biden and Ms Harris climbed into vehicles to travel to Arlington National Cemetery in neighbouring Virginia for a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier.

Later, the new president walked up to the entrance to the White House with his family, greeting a few supporters lining the route after they shouted ""we love you"".

His team have already announced the new administration will sign a series of executive orders reversing several of Mr Trump's policies, including on COVID-19, climate change and racial inequality.

Mr Biden's first tweet from the account said: ""There is no time to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face. That's why today, I am heading to the Oval Office to get right to work delivering bold action and immediate relief for American families.""

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Mr Biden and Ms Harris for being sworn in, and added: ""America's leadership is vital on the issues that matter to us all, from climate change to COVID, and I look forward to working with President Biden.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is moving swiftly to dismantle Donald Trump’s legacy on his first day in office, signing a series of executive actions that reverse course on immigration, climate change, racial equity and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

The new president signed the orders just hours after taking the oath of office at the Capitol, pivoting quickly from his pared-down inauguration ceremony to enacting his agenda. With the stroke of a pen, Biden ordered a halt to the construction of Trump’s U.S.-Mexico border wall, ended the ban on travel from some Muslim-majority countries, declared his intent to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and the World Health Organization and revoked the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline , aides said.

The 15 executive actions, and two directives, amount to an attempt to rewind the last four years of federal policies with striking speed. Only two recent presidents signed executive actions on their first day in office — and each signed just one. But Biden, facing the debilitating coronavirus pandemic, a damaged economy and a riven electorate , is intent on demonstrating a sense of urgency and competence that he argues has been missing under his Republican predecessor.

“There’s no time to start like today,” Biden said in his first comments to reporters as president.

Biden wore a mask as he signed the orders in the Oval Office — a marked departure from Trump, who rarely wore a face covering in public and never during events in the Oval Office. But virus precautions are now required in the building. Among the executive actions signed Wednesday was one requiring masks and physical distancing on federal property and by federal employees. Biden’s order also extended the federal eviction freeze to aid those struggling from the pandemic economic fallout, created a new federal office to coordinate a national response to the virus and restored the White House’s National Security Council directorate for global health security and defense, an office his predecessor had closed.

The actions reflected the new president’s top policy priority — getting a handle on a debilitating pandemic. In his inaugural address, Biden paused for what he called his first act as president — a moment of a silent prayer for the victims of the nation’s worst public health crisis in more than a century.

He declared that he would “press forward with speed and urgency” in coming weeks. “For we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities — much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build and much to gain,” he said in the speech.

But Biden’s blitz of executive actions went beyond the pandemic. He targeted Trump’s environmental record, calling for a review of all regulations and executive actions that are deemed damaging to the environment or public health, aides said Tuesday as they previewed the moves.

Another order instructs federal agencies to prioritize racial equity and review policies that reinforce systemic racism. Biden revoked two Trump orders related to the 2020 census. The first attempted to discern the citizenship status of every U.S. resident, and the second sought to exclude people in the U.S. illegally from the numbers used for apportioning congressional seats among the states.”

He also ordered federal employees to take an ethics pledge that commits them to upholding the independence of the Justice Department.

The president also revoked the just-issued report of Trump’s “1776 Commission” that promotes “patriotic education.”

Those moves and others will be followed by dozens more in the next 10 days, the president’s aides said, as Biden looks to redirect the country without having to go through a Senate that Democrats control by the narrowest margin and will soon turn to the impeachment trial of Trump, who is charged by the House with inciting the insurrection at the Capitol.

Republicans signaled that Biden will face fierce opposition on some parts of his agenda.

One of his orders seeks to fortify the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, a signature effort of the Obama administration that provided hundreds of thousands of young immigrants protection from deportation and a pathway to citizenship. That’s part of a broader immigration plan Biden sent to Congress on Wednesday that would provide an eight-year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal status.

The plan would lead to “a permanent cycle of illegal immigration and amnesty that would hurt hard-working Americans and the millions of legal immigrants working their way through the legal immigration process,” said Chris Hartline, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Even that familiar criticism seemed a return to the normalcy Biden has promised after years of disruptive and overheated politics. Hewing to tradition, Biden started his day by attending church with both Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress. His press secretary, Jen Psaki, held a briefing for reporters, a practice the Trump White House had all but abandoned in the final two months of the presidency. Psaki said she intended to restore regular briefings as part of the White House’s commitment to transparency.

“I have deep respect for the role of a free and independent press in our democracy and for the role all of you play,” she said.

Biden took other steps to try to signal his priorities and set the tone in his White House. As he swore in dozens of political appointees in a virtual ceremony, he declared he expected “honesty and decency” from all that worked for his administration and would fire anyone who shows disrespect to others “on the spot.”

“Everyone is entitled to human decency and dignity,” Biden said. “That’s been missing in a big way for the last four years.”"
Trump Has Discussed Starting a New Political Party,38,l1apb7,https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-impeachment-biden-inauguration/card/90pPMzFPqr5fMzg1Bkbs,19,1611183257.0,,"President Trump has talked in recent days with associates about forming a new political party, according to people familiar with the matter, an effort to exert continued influence after he leaves the White House.

Mr. Trump discussed the matter with several aides and other people close to him last week, the people said. The president said he would want to call the new party the “Patriot Party,” the people said.

Mr. Trump has feuded in recent days with several Republican leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who on Tuesday said Mr. Trump deserved blame for provoking the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Polls show Mr. Trump retains strong support among rank-and-file GOP voters.

The White House declined to comment.

It’s unclear how serious Mr. Trump is about starting a new party, which would require a significant investment of time and resources. The president has a large base of supporters, some of whom were not deeply involved in Republican politics prior to Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign.

Third parties have typically failed to draw enough support to play a major role in national elections. Any effort to start a new party would likely face intense opposition from Republican party officials, who would chafe at the thought of Mr. Trump peeling off support from GOP candidates.

Trump pardons ex-aide Bannon but not himself or family,224,l199n2,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pardons/as-he-leaves-office-trump-pardons-former-top-strategist-bannon-idUSKBN29P0BE,87,1611178508.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump granted clemency to former White House aide Steve Bannon as part of a wave of pardons and commutations issued in his final hours in office, but did not pardon himself, members of his family or lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

Trump left office on Wednesday when Joe Biden was sworn in as the nation’s next president. White House officials had argued to Trump that he should not pardon himself or his family because it might look like they are guilty of crimes, according to a source familiar with the situation.

Bannon, who was a key adviser in Trump’s 2016 presidential run, was charged last year with swindling the president’s own supporters over an effort to raise private funds to build the president’s wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He has pleaded not guilty.

“Bannon has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen,” the White House said in a statement.

White House officials had advised Trump against pardoning Bannon. The two men have lately rekindled their relationship as Trump sought support for his unproven claims of voter fraud, an official familiar with the situation said.

As part of more than 140 pardons and commutations, Trump also pardoned Elliott Broidy, a former top fundraiser for Trump who pleaded guilty last year to violating foreign lobbying laws, and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who was serving a 28-year prison term on corruption charges.

Rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black who were prosecuted on federal weapons offenses, were also granted pardons, as was Kenneth Kurson, the former editor of a newspaper Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner owned. Kurson had been accused of cyberstalking his ex-wife.

Albert Pirro Jr., the former husband of Fox News television commentator Jeanine Pirro who had represented Trump as a real estate lawyer two decades ago, received a pardon on Wednesday morning. He had been convicted on tax evasion and conspiracy charges.

Giuliani, who has been at the forefront of Trump’s unsuccessful efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, has not been charged with a crime, but investigators have been probing his activities in Ukraine.

Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House last week on charges of inciting the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by the president’s supporters. He may face a Senate trial and could be barred from running for president again if convicted.

PROMINENT ALLIES

The pardon power, which comes from the U.S. Constitution, is one of the broadest available to a president. While pardons are typically given to people who have been prosecuted, pardons can cover conduct that has not yet resulted in legal proceedings.

A pardon is not reviewable by other branches of government and the president does not have to give a reason for issuing one. But the pardon power is not absolute; it only applies to federal crimes.

Bannon, 67, is the latest prominent political ally to receive clemency from Trump, who has often used the powers of the executive branch to reward loyalists and punish his enemies.

Trump previously pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI about his conversation with the former Russian ambassador, and he commuted the prison term for Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The former executive chairman and co-founder of the right-wing news outlet Breitbart, Bannon is credited as being the architect behind the rise of “America First” right-wing populism. He was a key influencer behind some of Trump’s staunch anti-immigration policies in the early days of Trump’s presidency, as well as the border wall that was one of Trump’s key campaign promises.

He was fired from his post at the White House in August 2017.

Bannon can still be charged with fraud by New York state prosecutors, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former prosecutor now at the Buckley law firm. Fraud prosecutions are frequently brought by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, Alonso added.

Broidy, who was a top fundraiser for Trump during the 2016 campaign, pleaded guilty in October to violating lobbying laws by attempting to influence the administration on behalf of Chinese and Malaysian interests.

Lil Wayne, 38, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., pleaded guilty in federal court in December to illegally possessing a firearm and faced up to 10 years in prison. He has expressed support for Trump’s criminal justice reform efforts.

Kodak Black, 23, who was born Bill Kahan Kapri, is in federal prison for making a false statement in order to buy a firearm."
Biden to propose 8-year citizenship path for immigrants,372,l0u6jo,https://apnews.com/article/biden-8-year-citizenship-path-immigrants-4f2dffdb7a688e1e126a62a8acd59730,90,1611121778.0,,"President-elect Joe Biden waves to reporters as walks out of The Queen theater Monday, Jan. 18, 2021, in Wilmington, Del.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden plans to unveil a sweeping immigration bill on Day One of his administration, hoping to provide an eight-year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal status, a massive reversal from the Trump administration’s harsh immigration policies.

The legislation puts Biden on track to deliver on a major campaign promise important to Latino voters and other immigrant communities after four years of President Donald Trump’s restrictive policies and mass deportations. It provides one of the fastest pathways to citizenship for those living without legal status of any measure in recent years, but it fails to include the traditional trade-off of enhanced border security favored by many Republicans, making passage in a narrowly divided Congress in doubt.

ADVERTISEMENT

Expected to run hundreds of pages, the bill is set to be introduced after Biden takes the oath of office Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the legislation and granted anonymity to discuss it.

As a candidate, Biden called Trump’s actions on immigration an “unrelenting assault” on American values and said he would “undo the damage” while continuing to maintain border enforcement.

Under the legislation, those living in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021, without legal status would have a five-year path to temporary legal status, or a green card, if they pass background checks, pay taxes and fulfill other basic requirements. From there, it’s a three-year path to naturalization, if they decide to pursue citizenship.

For some immigrants, the process would be quicker. So-called Dreamers, the young people who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children, as well as agricultural workers and people under temporary protective status could qualify more immediately for green cards if they are working, are in school or meet other requirements.

The bill is not as comprehensive as the last major immigration overhaul proposed when Biden was vice president during the Obama administration.

For example, it does not include a robust border security element, but rather calls for coming up with strategies. Nor does it create any new guest worker or other visa programs.

It does address some of the root causes of migration from Central America to the United States, and provides grants for workforce development and English language learning.

Biden is expected to take swift executive actions to reverse other Trump immigration actions, including an end to the prohibition on arrivals from several predominantly Muslim countries.

During the Democratic primary, Biden consistently named immigration action as one of his “day one” priorities, pointing to the range of executive powers he could invoke to reverse Trump’s policies.

Full Coverage: Biden Transition

Biden allies and even some Republicans have identified immigration as a major issue where the new administration could find common ground with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and enough other GOP senators to avoid the stalemate that has vexed administrations of both parties for decades.

That kind of major win — even if it involves compromise — could be critical as Biden looks for legislative victories in a closely divided Congress, where Republicans are certain to oppose other Biden priorities that involve rolling back some of the GOP’s 2017 tax cuts and increasing federal spending.

As a candidate, Biden went so far as to say the Obama administration went too far in its aggressive deportations.

Two Guard members removed from Biden inauguration,21,l0qxzo,https://apnews.com/article/biden-inauguration-joe-biden-860c2c28bb3b45a28625352df50de294,4,1611112687.0,,"Riot shields are stacked at the ready as National Guard troops reinforce the security zone on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2021, before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Twelve U.S. National Guard members have been removed from securing President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration after vetting by the FBI, including two who made extremist statements in posts or texts about the Wednesday event, Pentagon officials said. There were no specific threats to Biden.

Two other U.S. officials told The Associated Press that all 12 were found to have ties with right-wing militia groups or posted extremist views online. The officials, a senior intelligence official and an Army official briefed on the matter, did not say which fringe groups the Guard members belonged to or what unit they served in. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity. The officials told the AP they had all been removed because of “security liabilities.”

Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, confirmed that Guard members had been removed and sent home but he said only two cases were for inappropriate comments or texts related to the inauguration. He said the other 10 were for other potential issues that may involve previous criminal behavior or other activities, but were not directly related to the inaugural event.

Their removal from the massive security presence at the nation’s capital comes as U.S. defense officials have been worried about a potential insider attack or other threat from service members following the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6 by Trump supporters. The FBI has been working to vet all 25,000 National Guard in town. Officials have said that the Pentagon has found no intelligence so far that would indicate an insider threat.

But the FBI has also warned law enforcement officials about the possibility that right-wing fringe groups could pose as members of the National Guard, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter.

Neither Hokanson, nor Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman would provide details on the comments or texts made by the two Guard members. Speaking at a Pentagon press conference, Hokanson said one was identified by his chain of command and the other was identified through an anonymous tip.

“Much of the information,” Hoffman said, “is unrelated to the events taking place at the Capitol or to the concerns that many people have noted on extremism. These are vetting efforts that identify any questionable behavior in the past or any potential link to questionable behavior, not just related to extremism.”

Hoffman added that officials aren’t asking questions right now of those who were flagged. “We’re, out of an abundance of caution, taking action and immediately removing them from the line of duty at the Capitol and the events taking place.”

“And then we will address them, whether it’s through law enforcement if necessary or through their own chain of command,” he added.

Washington has been on edge since the deadly insurrection at the Capitol, which has prompted extraordinary security measures ahead of Biden’s inauguration. A fire in a homeless camp roughly a mile from the Capitol complex prompted a lockdown Monday during a rehearsal for the inauguration.

U.S. Secret Service tightened security in and around the Capitol days earlier than usual in preparation, and the city center is essentially on lockdown with streets blocked, high fencing installed and tens of thousands of troops and law enforcement officers stationed around the area.

Federal law enforcement officials have also been wary of increased surveillance of military and law enforcement checkpoints and other positions after National Guard troops reported people taking pictures and recording them, said the law enforcement officials, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing security matters.

The Secret Service issued a bulletin over the weekend about what it sees as an “uptick” in National Guard troops posting pictures and details of their operations online.

The Associated Press obtained the “all concerned” message sent to all National Guard troops coming to Washington. Without getting into specific postings, the bulletin read, “No service members should be posting locations, pictures or descriptions online regarding current operations or the sensitive sites they are protecting” and urged them to stop immediately.

Full Coverage: Biden inauguration

Asked about the bulletin, a spokesperson for the Secret Service issued a statement saying it “does not comment on matters of protective intelligence.”

Contacted by the AP Tuesday morning, the National Guard Bureau referred questions to the U.S. Secret Service and said, “Due to operational security, we do not discuss the process nor the outcome of the vetting process for military members supporting the inauguration.”

Over the summer, a man was arrested in Los Angeles for impersonating a National Guard member during protests in the city near Los Angeles City Hall. The man, Gregory Wong, was carrying a sidearm and assault rifle but was taken into custody after actual Guardsmen confronted him when they noticed things out of place on his uniform.

US accuses China of 'genocide' of Uyghurs in Xinjiang,18,l0q3wn,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/19/us/us-xinjiang-china-genocide-intl/index.html,10,1611110366.0,,"(CNN) The US has officially determined that China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and ethnic and religious minority groups who live in the northwestern region of Xinjiang .

""This genocide is ongoing, and...we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Tuesday, on the last full day of the Trump administration.

""Since at least March 2017, local authorities dramatically escalated their decades-long campaign of repression against Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups, including ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Kyrgyz,"" Pompeo said.

The US State Department has previously estimated that up to two million Uyghurs, as well as members of other Muslim minority groups, have been detained in a sprawling network of internment camps in the region.

Former reeducation camp detainees have told CNN they experienced political indoctrination and abuse inside the camps, such as food and sleep deprivation and forced injections. CNN reporting has also found that some Uyghur women were forced to use birth control and undergo sterilization as part of a deliberate attempt to push down birth rates among minorities in Xinjiang.

China denies allegations of such human rights abuses in Xinjiang. It has insisted that its reeducation camps are necessary for preventing religious extremism and terrorism in the area, which is home to about 11 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that speak a language closely related to Turkish and have their own distinct culture.

Op-eds and reports in Chinese state-controlled media have also specifically argued against applying the term ""genocide"" to the situation.

At a press conference Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused Pompeo of spreading ""poison"" with his genocide declaration.

""This is just one of many of his absurd, big lies,"" Hua said in response to CNN's question. ""In our view, Pompeo's so-called declaration is a piece of scrap paper.""

Hua singled out Pompeo himself for special criticism. ""This American politician, who is notorious for lying, is turning himself into a doomsday clown and joke of the century,"" Hua said.

The State Department's declaration won't automatically trigger any immediate penalties, but Peter Irwin, senior program officer at the Uyghur Human Rights Project, said it would have a powerful symbolic impact, both in the US and internationally.

""Determinations like these are only meaningful insofar as they're supported by tangible, sustained pressure,"" he said. ""The worst thing that the US government can do, especially when we're in the midst of a transition of power, is to become self-satisfied with this powerful rhetorical statement about the crisis without following it up.""

A Washington-based advocacy group, Campaign for Uyghurs, welcomed the designation as a step toward justice.

""As any victim will tell you, having the eyes of the world community see us, and acknowledge that our horror is real, means everything,"" said CFU director Rushan Abbas in a statement Tuesday.

""My own sister's 20 year prison sentence on false charges is clearly linked to this genocidal intent by the Chinese regime. She, and all Uyghurs, deserve justice,"" she added.

Darren Byler, a Xinjiang expert and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Colorado, said he anticipated the ruling would strength Uyghur claims for asylum in the US as well as increase pressure to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. ""But I don't know what it will mean for Uyghurs in China,"" he said.

Concern over human rights issues in Xinjiang is a bipartisan issue in the US. However, the announcement in the final hours of the Trump administration could further complicate the incoming Biden administration's approach to and dealings with Beijing.

The president-elect has spoken out about China's human rights abuses and in November 2019 called the mass internment of Uyghur Muslims ""among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today."" ""The US cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world,"" Biden tweeted.

In a statement to Politico in August, his campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates described China's actions in Xinjiang as genocide. On Tuesday, Biden's nominee for Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he also agreed with the designation.

In his statement, Pompeo also said he had ""directed the US Department of State to continue to investigate and collect relevant information regarding the ongoing atrocities occurring in Xinjiang, and to make this evidence available to appropriate authorities and the international community to the extent allowable by law.""

The treatment of Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang has been widely condemned by the international community. In July 2019, twenty-two countries including Japan and the UK signed a letter urging China to end its ""mass arbitrary detentions and related violations"" and called on Beijing to allow UN experts to access the region.

In December, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning China over the forced labor allegations. The British government has also criticized Beijing and said earlier this month that it would fine companies which hide connections to Xinjiang.

The new measures are designed to ensure that all British organizations ""are not complicit in, nor profiting from, the human rights violations in Xinjiang,"" according to the UK Foreign Office."
Democratic lawmaker accuses Boebert of giving tours prior to insurrection,316,l0hr27,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/18/politics/steve-cohen-lauren-boebert-capitol-tours/index.html,103,1611083172.0,,"(CNN) Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee said that he and a fellow lawmaker personally saw Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado guiding a group of people through the Cannon House Office Building tunnel in the days leading up the Capitol insurrection on January 6.

Cohen's accusation is significant because it is the first time a member of Congress has specifically accused another member of giving a tour of the Capitol complex prior to the riot. It comes after several Democratic members have suggested that their Republican colleagues may have been providing the tours as an opportunity for the would-be rioters to get the lay of the land ahead of a planned insurrection.

""Only thing that I've seen, Congressman Yarmuth refreshed my recollection yesterday. We saw (Rep.) Boebert taking a group of people for a tour sometime after the 3rd and before the 6th. I don't remember the day we were walking in a tunnel and we saw her and commented who she was and she had a large group with her. Now whether these people were people that were involved in the insurrection or not, I do not know,"" Cohen told CNN's Jim Sciutto on ""CNN Newsroom.""

Cohen continued, ""She was a freshman, she might have had a large number of people coming to be with her on this historic occasion and just wanting to give them the opportunity to have a tour. But it is pretty clear that her team is the team -- she's not on the home team. She was with the visitors.""

Boebert sent a letter to Cohen responding to the allegations he made on CNN, disputing the congressman's characterization and saying his comments ""repeat irresponsible lies in order to elevate his own political relevance and to further fuel the division of our country.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — As the rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, many of the police officers had to decide on their own how to fight them off. There was no direction. No plan. And no top leadership.

One cop ran from one side of the building to another, fighting hand-to-hand against rioters. Another decided to respond to any calls of officers in distress and spent three hours helping cops who had been immobilized by bear spray or other chemicals.

Three officers were able to handcuff one rioter. But a crowd swarmed the group and took the arrested man away with the handcuffs still on.

Interviews with four members of the U.S. Capitol Police who were overrun by rioters on Jan. 6 show just how quickly the command structure collapsed as throngs of people, egged on by President Donald Trump, set upon the Capitol . The officers spoke on condition of anonymity because the department has threatened to suspend anyone who speaks to the media.

“We were on our own,” one of the officers told The Associated Press. “Totally on our own.”

The officers who spoke to the AP said they were given next to no warning by leadership on the morning of Jan. 6 about what would become a growing force of thousands of rioters, many better armed than the officers themselves were. And once the riot began, they were given no instructions by the department’s leaders on how to stop the mob or rescue lawmakers who had barricaded themselves inside. There were only enough officers for a routine day.

Full Coverage: Capitol siege

Three officers told the AP they did not hear Chief Steven Sund on the radio the entire afternoon. It turned out he was sheltering with Vice President Mike Pence in a secure location for some of the siege. Sund resigned the next day.

His assistant chief, Yogananda Pittman, who is now interim chief, was heard over the radio telling the force to “lock the building down,” with no further instructions, two officers said.

One specific order came from Lt. Tarik Johnson, who told officers not to use deadly force outside the building as the rioters descended, the officers recounted. The order almost certainly prevented deaths and more chaos, but it meant officers didn’t pull their weapons and were fighting back with fists and batons.

Johnson has been suspended after being captured on video wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat while moving through crowds of rioters. Johnson told colleagues he wore the hat as a tactic to gain the crowd’s confidence as he tried to reach other officers who were pinned down by rioters, one of the officers said. A video of the incident obtained by the Wall Street Journal shows Johnson asking rioters for help in getting his colleagues.

Johnson, who could not be reached for comment, was heard by an officer on the radio repeatedly asking, “Does anybody have a plan?”

The Capitol Police has more than 2,300 staff and a budget that’s grown rapidly over the last two decades to roughly $500 million, making it larger than many major metro police departments. Minneapolis, for example, has 840 officers and a $176 million budget.

Despite plenty of online warnings of a possible insurrection and ample resources and time to prepare, the Capitol Police planned only for a free speech demonstration on Jan. 6.

They rejected offers of support from the Pentagon three days before the siege, according to senior defense officials and two people familiar with the matter. And during the riot, they turned down an offer by the Justice Department to have FBI agents come in as reinforcements. The officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the decision-making process.

The riot left five people dead, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was hit in the head by a fire extinguisher. Another officer died in an apparent suicide after the attack.

The attack has forced a reckoning among law enforcement agencies. Federal watchdogs launched a sweeping review of how the FBI, the Pentagon and other agencies responded to the riot, including whether there were failures in information sharing and other preparations that left the historic symbol of democracy vulnerable to assault.

Top decision-makers have offered differing explanations for why they didn’t have enough personnel.

Sund told The Washington Post that he was worried about the possibility for violence and wanted to bring in the National Guard, but the House and Senate sergeants at arms refused his request. To bring in the Guard, the sergeants at arms would have had to ask congressional leaders.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, said congressional leaders had not been informed of any request for the National Guard before the day of the riot. The office of Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, declined to comment.

It’s not clear why the threat was not taken more seriously.

John Donohue, a 32-year veteran of the New York Police Department who advises the Capitol Police on intelligence matters, sent a memo on Jan. 3 warning of the potential for an attack on Congress from the pro-Trump crowd, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the memo first reported by The Washington Post. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal memo.

Donohue was well-versed in the extremist threat. At a congressional hearing in July, before he starting advising the Capitol Police, Donohue told lawmakers the federal government needed a system to better monitor social media for domestic extremists.

“America is at a crossroads,” he said in his testimony. “The intersection of constitutional rights and legitimate law enforcement has never been more at risk by domestic actors as it is now as seditionists actively promote a revolution.”

Tens of thousands of National Guard members have now been called to secure the Capitol in advance of the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday.

A spokeswoman for Capitol Police did not respond to questions Friday.

For major events, the Capitol Police normally holds meetings to brief officers on their responsibilities and plans in case of an emergency. Three of the officers interviewed by the AP said there were no meetings on or before Jan. 6. It’s also unclear whether the department held over its overnight shift or called in more officers early to help those who would be on duty that day.

“During the 4th of July concerts and the Memorial Day concerts, we don’t have people come up and say, ‘We’re going to seize the Capitol,’” one officer said. “But yet, you bring everybody in, you meet before. That never happened for this event.”

Another officer said he was only told that morning to pick up a riot helmet. He said he had training on dealing with large crowds, but not on how to handle a riot.

“We were under the impression it was just going to be a lot of yelling, cursing,” he said.

As Trump called on his supporters to go to the Capitol, telling them to “fight like hell,” members of the House and Senate were inside the building to certify Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College.

Crowds of Trump supporters, many of them linked to far-right or white supremacist groups, began gathering on both sides of the Capitol.

An officer working the western front of the building, which faces the White House and where risers were set up for the inauguration, quickly realized that the crowds were not peaceful. The rioters began breaking down short fences and systematically clipping off “Area Closed” signs, the officer said.

Videos from the event show the crowd climbing the walls on the western side and eventually breaching the building.

One officer listed the various weapons used to hit him and people near him: batons, flagpoles, sections of fencing, batteries, rubber bullets and canisters of bear spray that went further than the chemicals the officers themselves had. Some of the rioters showed their badges from other law enforcement agencies, claiming they were on the side of the Capitol Police, the officer said.

Most of the insurrectionists left without being arrested, which officers who spoke to the AP say was because it was next to impossible to arrest them given how badly the force was outnumbered. That was underscored by the rioters taking away a man who officers had tried to arrest inside the Capitol.

“The group came and snatched him and took him away in cuffs,” one officer said. “Outside of shooting people, what are you supposed to do?”

"Trump to issue around 100 pardons and commutations Tuesday, sources say",372,kzw39s,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/17/politics/trump-pardons-expected/index.html,81,1611010391.0,,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is preparing to issue around 100 pardons and commutations on his final full day in office Tuesday, according to three people familiar with the matter, a major batch of clemency actions that includes white collar criminals, high-profile rappers and others but -- as of now -- is not expected to include Trump himself.

The White House held a meeting on Sunday to finalize the list of pardons, two sources said.

Trump, who had been rolling out pardons and commutations at a steady clip ahead of Christmas, had put a pause on them in the days leading up to and directly after the January 6 riots at the US Capitol, according to officials.

Aides said Trump was singularly focused on the Electoral College count in the days ahead of time, precluding him for making final decisions on pardons. White House officials had expected them to resume after January 6, but Trump retreated after he was blamed for inciting the riots.

Initially, two major batches had been ready to roll out, one at the end of last week and one on Tuesday. Now, officials expect the last batch to be the only one -- unless Trump decides at the last minute to grant pardons to controversial allies, members of his family or himself.

The final batch of clemency actions is expected to include a mix of criminal justice reform-minded pardons and more controversial ones secured or doled out to political allies.

The pardons are one of several items Trump must complete before his presidency ends in days. White House officials also still have executive orders prepared, and the President is still hopeful to declassify information related to the Russia probe before he leaves office. But with a waning number of administration officials still in jobs, the likelihood that any of it gets done seemed to be shrinking.

The January 6 riots that led to Trump's second impeachment have complicated his desire to pardon himself, his kids and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. At this point, aides do not think he will do so, but caution only Trump knows what he will do with his last bit of presidential power before he is officially out of office at noon on January 20.

After the riots, advisers encouraged Trump to forgo a self-pardon because it would appear like he was guilty of something, according to one person familiar with the conversations. Several of Trump's closest advisers have also urged him not to grant clemency to anyone involved in the siege on the US Capitol, despite Trump's initial stance that those involved had done nothing wrong.

""There are a lot of people urging the President to pardon the folks"" involved in the insurrection, Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on Fox News. ""To seek a pardon of these people would be wrong.""

One White House official said paperwork had not yet been drawn up for a self-pardon.

Still, Trump is expected to leave the White House on January 20 and could issue pardons up until noon on Inauguration Day.

Other attention-grabbing names, like Julian Assange , are also not currently believed to among the people receiving pardons, but the list is still fluid and that could change, too.

It's also not certain whether Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon will receive a pardon.

Trump is still receiving multiple streams of recommendations on pardons from those advisers who remain at the White House, as well as people outside the building who have been lobbying for months for themselves or their clients.

The expectation among allies is that Trump will issue pardons that he could benefit from post presidency.

""Everything is a transaction. He likes pardons because it is unilateral. And he likes doing favors for people he thinks will owe him,"" one source familiar with the matter said.

Salomon Melgen clemency possible

Dr. Salomon Melgen, a prominent eye doctor from Palm Beach, Florida, who is in prison after being convicted on dozens of counts of health care fraud, is currently expected to be included in the clemency list, three sources familiar tell CNN.

Melgen, who is noteworthy for being the co-conspirator in a since-dismissed corruption case against Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, was sentenced to 17 years for health care fraud in 2018.

While his name surprised some Trump allies given the President's attitude toward Menendez, Melgen is seen as a wealthy and influential figure in south Florida. The corruption case against Menendez and Melgen was dropped by the Justice Department in January 2018

Inside the White House, there has been a scramble to petition for pardons on behalf of allies and advocacy groups and names could be added and taken off up until the last minute, sources say.

CNN previously reported there has been a crush of pardon requests during Trump's final days in office from allies, lobbyists and others hoping to cash in on their loyalty to Trump. The New York Times reported Sunday some of those people were getting paid tens of thousands of dollars to lobby on behalf of felons hoping for pardons.

FBI vetting Guard troops in DC amid fears of insider attack,280,kzlfmo,https://apnews.com/article/biden-inauguration-joe-biden-capitol-siege-ap-top-news-857bacc273e16ff82dc9fefed1242ae8,27,1610967089.0,,"National Guard troops reinforce security around the U.S. Capitol ahead of expected protests leading up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, in Washington, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2021, following the deadly attack on Congress by a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. defense officials say they are worried about an insider attack or other threat from service members involved in securing President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, prompting the FBI to vet all of the 25,000 National Guard troops coming into Washington for the event.

The massive undertaking reflects the extraordinary security concerns that have gripped Washington following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by pro-Trump rioters. And it underscores fears that some of the very people assigned to protect the city over the next several days could present a threat to the incoming president and other VIPs in attendance.

Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press on Sunday that officials are conscious of the potential threat, and he warned commanders to be on the lookout for any problems within their ranks as the inauguration approaches. So far, however, he and other leaders say they have seen no evidence of any threats, and officials said the vetting hadn’t flagged any issues that they were aware of.

”We’re continually going through the process, and taking second, third looks at every one of the individuals assigned to this operation,” McCarthy said in an interview after he and other military leaders went through an exhaustive, three-hour security drill in preparation for Wednesday’s inauguration. He said Guard members are also getting training on how to identify potential insider threats.

About 25,000 members of the National Guard are streaming into Washington from across the country — at least two and a half times the number for previous inaugurals. And while the military routinely reviews service members for extremist connections, the FBI screening is in addition to any previous monitoring.

Multiple officials said the process began as the first Guard troops began deploying to D.C. more than a week ago. And they said it is slated to be complete by Wednesday. Several officials discussed military planning on condition of anonymity.

“The question is, is that all of them? Are there others?” said McCarthy. “We need to be conscious of it and we need to put all of the mechanisms in place to thoroughly vet these men and women who would support any operations like this.”

In a situation like this one, FBI vetting would involve running peoples’ names through databases and watchlists maintained by the bureau to see if anything alarming comes up. That could include involvement in prior investigations or terrorism-related concerns, said David Gomez, a former FBI national security supervisor in Seattle.

Insider threats have been a persistent law enforcement priority in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But in most cases, the threats are from homegrown insurgents radicalized by al-Qaida, the Islamic State group or similar groups. In contrast, the threats against Biden’s inauguration have been fueled by supporters of President Donald Trump, far-right militants, white supremacists and other radical groups. Many believe Trump’s baseless accusations that the election was stolen from him, a claim that has been refuted by many courts, the Justice Department and Republican officials in key battleground states.

The insurrection at the Capitol began after Trump made incendiary remarks at the Jan. 6 rally. According to McCarthy, service members from across the military were at that rally, but it’s not clear how many were there or who may have participated in the breach at the Capitol. So far only a couple of current active-duty or National Guard members have been arrested in connection with the Capitol assault, which left five people dead. The dead included a Capitol Police officer and a woman shot by police as she climbed through a window in a door near the House chamber.

Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, has been meeting with Guard troops as they arrive in D.C. and as they gather downtown. He said he believes there are good processes in place to identify any potential threats.

“If there’s any indication that any of our soldiers or airmen are expressing things that are extremist views, it’s either handed over to law enforcement or dealt with the chain of command immediately,” he said.

The insider threat, however, was just one of the security concerns voiced by officials on Sunday, as dozens of military, National Guard, law enforcement and Washington, D.C., officials and commanders went through a security rehearsal in northern Virginia. As many as three dozen leaders lined tables that ringed a massive color-coded map of D.C. reflected onto the floor. Behind them were dozens more National Guard officers and staff, with their eyes trained on additional maps and charts displayed on the wall.

The Secret Service is in charge of event security, but there is a wide variety of military and law enforcement personnel involved, ranging from the National Guard and the FBI to Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department, U.S. Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police.

Commanders went over every aspect of the city’s complicated security lockdown, with McCarthy and others peppering them with questions about how the troops will respond in any scenario and how well they can communicate with the other enforcement agencies scattered around the city.

Hokanson said he believes his troops have been adequately equipped and prepared, and that they are rehearsing as much as they can to be prepared for any contingency.

The major security concern is an attack by armed groups of individuals, as well as planted explosives and other devices. McCarthy said intelligence reports suggest that groups are organizing armed rallies leading up to Inauguration Day, and possibly after that.

The bulk of the Guard members will be armed. And McCarthy said units are going through repeated drills to practice when and how to use force and how to work quickly with law enforcement partners. Law enforcement officers would make any arrests.

He said Guard units are going through “constant mental repetitions of looking at the map and talking through scenarios with leaders so they understand their task and purpose, they know their routes, they know where they’re friendly, adjacent units are, they have the appropriate frequencies to communicate with their law enforcement partners.”

The key goal, he said, is for America’s transfer of power to happen without incident.

“This is a national priority. We have to be successful as an institution,” said McCarthy. “We want to send the message to everyone in the United States and for the rest of the world that we can do this safely and peacefully.”

"Biden indicates plans to cancel Keystone XL pipeline permit on first day in office, sources confirm",5,kzjcdm,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/biden-keystone-xl-1.5877038,2,1610960049.0,,"U.S. president-elect Joe Biden has indicated plans to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline permit via executive action on his first day in office, sources confirmed to CBC News on Sunday.

A purported briefing note from the Biden transition team mentioning the plan was widely circulated over the weekend after being shared by the incoming president's team with U.S. stakeholders.

The words ""Rescind Keystone XL pipeline permit"" appear on a list of executive actions supposedly scheduled for Day 1 of Biden's presidency.

The list shown to stakeholders is a lengthier version of a list already reported in the media based on a memo released publicly over the weekend by Biden's chief of staff Ronald Klain. That publicly reported memo from Klain did not mention Keystone XL, but cautioned that the memo was not a complete list of planned actions.

The Biden team has announced plans to sign dozens of executive orders in the incoming president's first few days in office.

Climate actions planned for first day

They include a raft of environmental policies to be enacted on the first day of his presidency, including re-joining the Paris climate accord. The note shown to stakeholders has led some to expect that the first-day climate actions will include the move to cancel the project to carry Canadian bitumen.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in his first conversation with Biden as president-elect in November, indicated that he wanted to speak further about some potential irritants — including Keystone XL and Biden's proposed Buy American policies.

WATCH | Cancelling Keystone XL permit to be among Biden's first actions: sources:

Cancelling Keystone XL permit to be among Biden’s first actions, sources say The National Video 2:09 Joe Biden’s plans for his first 100 days in office are coming out, and sources confirmed to CBC News that Biden has indicated plans to cancel the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on Day 1 — along with dismantling several pieces of Trump’s legacy. 2:09

Biden foreshadowed such a cancellation months ago, announcing in a U.S. TV interview and through statements from his campaign team that he intended to cancel the $8-billion, cross-border pipeline.

However, proponents of the project have been hoping that he might reconsider once in office.

Federal Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole called on Trudeau to reach out to the incoming U.S. administration to ensure Keystone moves forward. ""Keystone XL is a project of national significance that supports countless workers on both sides of the border,"" he said in an emailed statement.

However, Green Party Leader Annamie Paul welcomed the news, calling Biden's potential actions a ""contrast in leadership"" to new offshore drilling projects greenlit by Canada's environment minister earlier this week.

Former TC Energy executive Dennis McConaghy is not surprised the project is among the first decisions by the new administration.

""I have consistently said Biden would indulge in this rescinding of the permit immediately because it's something he has to do largely to follow through for expectations of his political base and many of his donors,"" McConaghy told CBC's Kyle Bakx on Sunday.

The decision would likely lead to disappointment in the Canadian oilpatch, even after so many other setbacks for the project over the last decade.

""Ideally the project should have been completed and put into operation during the Trump administration,"" McConaghy said. ""It's a very audacious thing that is being done here by the Biden administration.""

Ambassador says Canada continues to support project

Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., said in a statement sent to The Canadian Press that the pipeline expansion fits with Canada's climate plan.

""The Government of Canada continues to support the Keystone XL project and the benefits that it will bring to both Canada and the United States,"" she said.

""Not only has the project itself changed significantly since it was first proposed, but Canada's oilsands production has also changed significantly. Per-barrel oilsands GHG emissions have dropped 31 per cent since 2000, and innovation will continue to drive progress.""

Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada, suggested Canada's continued support of the pipeline was akin to ""beating [a] dead horse.""

""The Biden administration offers us a fresh start on addressing the climate crisis with a willing partner, so let's not blow it by pushing pipelines,"" Stewart said

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the pipeline expansion a disaster in a tweet.

""With all of the major crises facing America, we must never lose sight of the most existential threat facing our planet: climate change,"" he wrote.

The Keystone pipeline is & always has been a disaster. I'm delighted that Joe Biden will cancel the Keystone permit on his first day in office. With all of the major crises facing America, we must never lose sight of the most existential threat facing our planet: climate change. <a href=""https://t.co/8lDZDOgsVy"">https://t.co/8lDZDOgsVy</a> —@BernieSanders

TC Energy said in a release late Sunday that the company plans to spend $1.7 billion US on a solar, wind and battery-powered operating system for the pipeline, hire a union-only workforce, sign Indigenous equity partners and establish zero-emissions operations by 2030, all with an eye toward securing Biden's approval.

Canadian leg of pipeline under construction for months

The Alberta government agreed last year to invest about $1.5 billion as equity in the project, plus billions more in loan guarantees. As a result, the Canadian leg of the project has been under construction for several months with around 1,000 workers in southeast Alberta.

If completed, the 1,897-kilometre pipeline, first announced in 2005, would carry 830,000 barrels of crude a day from the oilsands in Hardisty, Alta., to Nebraska. It would then connect with the original Keystone that runs to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has said previously he thinks Alberta could have legal options to recoup taxpayer money should the permit be cancelled.

On Sunday, Kenney said in a statement posted to social media that he's deeply concerned that Biden may repeal the pipeline's presidential permit.

""Doing so would kill jobs on both sides of the border, weaken the critically important Canada-U.S. relationship and undermine U.S. national security by making the United States more dependent on OPEC oil imports in the future,"" Kenney said.

Kenney said should the U.S. repeal the permit, ""Alberta will work with TC Energy to use all legal avenues available to protect its interest in the project.""

In 2016, TC Energy launched a lawsuit and a multi-billion dollar North American Free Trade Agreement claim against the U.S. government. The company changed course after the election of President Donald Trump.

TC Energy could now take similar action in order to prevent walking away from Keystone XL empty-handed after a dozen years of setbacks, billions of dollars spent and thousands of pages of filings.

""There are plausible legal claims. I think you have to say all of those are less than 50 per cent shots to get your money back. Whether it is the end of the road depends on whether the investors want to stick by it,"" said James Coleman, an associate professor of energy law at Southern Methodist University in Texas, told CBC.

Prospect of Pardons in Final Days Fuels Market to Buy Access to Trump,15,kzhc2d,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/us/politics/trump-pardons.html,3,1610953474.0,,"There are few historical parallels. Perhaps the closest occurred in the final hours of Bill Clinton’s administration when he issued 170 pardons and commutations, some of which went to people who paid six-figure sums to his family and associates. But even Mr. Clinton, who was seen as flouting protocols, mostly rewarded people who had gone through an intensive Justice Department review process intended to identify and vet the most deserving recipients from among thousands of clemency applications.

Mr. Trump has shunned that process more than any recent president, creating an ad hoc system in the White House that Mr. Kushner has had significant influence over and has relied on input from an informal network of outside advisers, including Mr. Tolman. That system favors pardon seekers who have connections to Mr. Trump or his team, or who pay someone who does, said pardon lawyers who have worked for years through the Justice Department system.

Few regulations or disclosure requirements govern presidential clemency grants or lobbying for them, particularly by lawyers, and there is nothing illegal about Trump associates being paid to lobby for clemency. Any explicit offers of payment to the president in return could be investigated as possible violations of bribery laws; no evidence has emerged that Mr. Trump was offered money in exchange for a pardon.

Some who used resources or connections to try to get to Mr. Trump say clemency should be granted to more people, independent of their clout.

“The criminal justice system is badly broken, badly flawed,” said the former senator, Tim Hutchinson, a Republican who served in Congress from 1993 to 2003. He has paid Mr. Tolman at least $10,000 since late last year to lobby the White House and Congress for a pardon for his son Jeremy Hutchinson, a former Arkansas state lawmaker who pleaded guilty in 2019 to accepting bribes and tax fraud, according to a lobbying disclosure filed this month."
"UK must not do trade deals with rights abusers, foreign minister says",124,kz6gll,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-trade/uk-must-not-do-trade-deals-with-rights-abusers-foreign-minister-says-idUSKBN29M0AL,8,1610919001.0,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should not engage in free trade with countries that abuse human rights, but proposals that the country’s courts should decide whether genocide has been committed by trade partners is flawed, foreign minister Dominic Raab said.

Last week, Raab said Britain would introduce new rules for its companies to try to prevent goods linked to China’s Xinjiang region entering their supply chains.

Some British lawmakers want to go further and are due to consider proposals passed in the upper house of parliament that would give courts the power to stop free-trade agreements with countries if they consider them to have committed genocide.

“The bar is being set incredibly high,” Raab told BBC television on Sunday. “I mean, frankly, we shouldn’t be engaged in free-trade negotiations with countries abusing human rights well below the level of genocide.”

He said the proposals in parliament were problematic because Britain’s High Court did not have the resources to investigate allegations of genocide.

“I think there’s a second issue, which is really in relation to what we now know about what’s going on in Xinjiang, the question is whether, in relation to any country that engaged in those human rights abuses, you engage in free-trade negotiations,” he said.

“We shouldn’t really be delegating the political question of who you engage in free-trade negotiations with to the courts,” Raab said. “That’s something MPs (members of parliament) should hold government to account about and we absolutely embrace that.”

Addressing parliament last week, Raab said there was evidence of forced labour among Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang after the United Nations estimated at least 1 million members of the minority among others were held in internment camps.

China denies the accusation. A foreign ministry spokesman denounced the accusations of abuse in Xinjiang as Western lies.

Britain is hoping to strike its own trade agreements with countries around the world following the expiry of a post-Brexit transition period for leaving the European Union."
U.S. state capitals on edge for armed protests as Trump presidency nears end,392,kyiy51,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-protests/us-capitols-on-edge-for-armed-protests-as-trump-presidency-nears-end-idUSKBN29L0CS,67,1610832601.0,,"(Reuters) - Ten days after rioters breached the U.S. Capitol in a deadly attack that stunned the world, cities nationwide were girding for a potential new wave of violent protests over the weekend, erecting barriers and deploying thousands of National Guard troops.

The FBI warned police agencies of possible armed demonstrations outside all 50 state capitol buildings starting Saturday through President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, fueled by supporters of President Donald Trump who believe his false claims of electoral fraud.

Michigan, Virginia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Washington were among more than a dozen states that activated their National Guards to strengthen security. Meanwhile, downtown Washington, D.C., was virtually empty, with streets near the Capitol closed and battalions of camouflaged National Guard soldiers taking up positions across the city center.

The nationwide security scramble followed the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mix of extremists and Trump supporters, some of whom called for the death of Vice President Mike Pence as he presided over the certification of Biden’s election victory.

The Democratic leaders of four U.S. congressional committees said on Saturday they had opened a review of the events and had written to the FBI and other intelligence and security agencies asking what was known about threats, whether the information was shared and whether foreign influence played any role.

“This still-emerging story is one of astounding bravery by some U.S. Capitol Police and other officers; of staggering treachery by violent criminals; and of apparent and high-level failures — in particular, with respect to intelligence and security preparedness,” said the letter.

It was signed by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.

There were scattered demonstrations on Saturday, but statehouses remained mostly quiet. Law enforcement officials have trained much of their focus on Sunday, when the anti-government “boogaloo” movement made plans weeks ago to hold rallies in all 50 states.

Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in a statement late Friday that intelligence indicated “violent extremists” may seek to exploit planned armed protests in Austin to “conduct criminal acts.” Texas closed its Capitol through Inauguration Day.

In Michigan, a fence was erected around the Capitol in Lansing, and troopers were mobilized from across the state to bolster security. The legislature canceled meetings next week, citing concern over credible threats.

In a nod to both the coronavirus pandemic as well as security concerns, festivities around Biden’s inauguration will largely be held online, though the president-elect still plans to be sworn in and deliver his inaugural address at the Capitol.

The inaugural committee’s virtual “welcome event” took place on Saturday evening, featuring appearances from union leaders, activists and celebrities such as actor Whoopi Goldberg.

“Make no mistake, the road ahead - it won’t be easy,” Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who closed out the event, told viewers. “But America is ready, and so are Joe and I.”

DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS

The perception that the Jan. 6 insurrection was a success could embolden domestic extremists motivated by anti-government, racial and partisan grievances, spurring them to further violence, according to a government intelligence bulletin dated Wednesday first reported by Yahoo News.

The Joint Intelligence Bulletin, produced by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center, further warned that “false narratives” about electoral fraud would serve as an ongoing catalyst for extremist groups.

Thousands of armed National Guard troops were on the streets of Washington in an unprecedented show of force after the assault on the U.S. Capitol. Bridges into the city were to be closed, and the National Mall and other iconic U.S. landmarks were blocked off into next week.

Authorities were on high alert. A Virginia man, Wesley Allen Beeler, was arrested on Friday evening at a security checkpoint after police said he presented an “unauthorized inauguration credential,” according to a Capitol Police spokeswoman. Beeler had a loaded handgun and more than 500 rounds of ammunition, according to court papers.

A tearful Beeler later told the Washington Post he had been working security in Washington all week and pulled up to the checkpoint after getting lost. He told the paper he forgot the gun was in his truck and denied having so much ammunition.

Beeler was released after an initial court appearance on Saturday and is due back in court in June, records show.

Responding to news of the arrest, Democratic U.S. Representative Don Beyer of Virginia said the danger was real and the city was on edge.

“Anyone who can avoid the area around the Capitol and Mall this week should do so,” Beyer wrote on Twitter.

The alarm extended beyond legislatures. The United Church of Christ, a Protestant denomination of more than 4,900 churches, warned its 800,000 members there were reports “liberal” churches could be attacked in the coming week.

Following the Jan. 6 violence in Washington, some militia members said they would not attend a long-planned pro-gun demonstration in Virginia, where authorities were worried about the risk of violence as multiple groups converged on the state capital, Richmond.

Some militias across the country have told followers to stay home this weekend, citing the increased security or the risk that the planned events were law enforcement traps."

BEIJING (AP) — China on Saturday finished building a 1,500-room hospital for COVID-19 patients to fight a surge in infections the government said are harder to contain and that it blamed on infected people or goods from abroad.

The hospital is one of six with a total of 6,500 rooms being built in Nangong, south of Beijing in Hebei province, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

China had largely contained the coronavirus that first was detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019 but has suffered a surge of cases since December.

A total of 645 people are being treated in Nangong and the Hebei provincial capital, Shijiazhuang, Xinhua said. A 3,000-room hospital is under construction in Shijiazhuang.

Virus clusters also have been found in Beijing and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning in the northeast and Sichuan in the southwest.

The latest infections spread unusually fast, the National Health Commission said.

“It is harder to handle,” a Commission statement said. “Community transmission already has happened when the epidemic is found, so it is difficult to prevent.”

The Commission blamed the latest cases on people or goods arriving from abroad. It blamed “abnormal management” and “inadequate protection of workers” involved in imports but gave no details.

“They are all imported from abroad. It was caused by entry personnel or contaminated cold chain imported goods,” said the statement.

The Chinese government has suggested the disease might have originated abroad and publicized what it says is the discovery of the virus on imported food, mostly frozen fish, though foreign scientists are skeptical.

Also Saturday, the city government of Beijing said travelers arriving in the Chinese capital from abroad would be required to undergo an additional week of “medical monitoring” after a 14-day quarantine but gave no details.

Nationwide, the Health Commission reported 130 new confirmed cases in the 24 hours through midnight Friday. It said 90 of those were in Hebei.

On Saturday, the Hebei government reported 32 additional cases since midnight, the Shanghai news outlet The Paper reported.

In Shijiazhuang, authorities have finished construction of 1,000 rooms of the planned hospital, state TV said Saturday. Xinhua said all the facilities are due to be completed within a week.

A similar program of rapid hospital construction was launched by the ruling Communist Party at the start of the outbreak last year in Wuhan.

More than 10 million people in Shijiazhuang underwent virus tests by late Friday, Xinhua said, citing a deputy mayor, Meng Xianghong. It said 247 locally transmitted cases were found.

Meanwhile, researchers sent by the World Health Organization were in Wuhan preparing to investigate the origins of the virus. The team, which arrived Thursday, was under a two-week quarantine but was due to talk with Chinese experts by video link.

The team’s arrival was held up for months by diplomatic wrangling that prompted a rare public complaint by the head of the WHO.

That delay, and the secretive ruling party’s orders to scientists not to talk publicly about the disease, have raised questions about whether Beijing might try to block discoveries that would hurt its self-proclaimed status as a leader in the anti-virus battle."
"NRA Files For Bankruptcy; Gun Lobby Under Investigation Hurls Insults At NY State, Plans To Reincorporate In Texas",43,kydw8r,https://deadline.com/2021/01/nra-bankruptcy-gun-lobby-under-investigation-hurls-insults-at-ny-state-plans-to-reincorporate-in-texas-1234675087/,7,1610808098.0,,"Powerful gun lobby the National Rifle Association of America has filed for bankruptcy in the Northern District of Texas where it will reincorporate as a nonprofit, leaving New York State, where it was founded in 1871.

In a bizarre statement Friday, the NRA, which has its physical headquarters in Fairfax, Va., said the plan “involves utilizing the protection of the bankruptcy court.” And it explained that the move will facilitate its exit from “a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York. The move will enable long-term, sustainable growth and ensure the NRA’s continued success as the nation’s leading advocate for constitutional freedom – free from the toxic political environment of New York.”

Basically, the Association “is dumping New York and organizing its legal and regulatory matters in an efficient forum. The move comes at a time when the NRA is in its strongest financial condition in years,” the group said.

The bankruptcy news follows leadership shakeups and scandals and allegations of financial mismanagement at the top, prompting a suit last summer by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The AG accused the NRA leadership — led by CEO Wayne LaPierre — of tax fraud and of diverting association funds for personal use. The self-dealing resulted in $63 million in losses over three years, she said.

Controversial LaPierre famously declared “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” The group has about five million members.

NRATV, the association’s online video channel ran from 2016 to 2019.

An NRA countersuit accused James of impeding the group’s First Amendment rights and said her suit was “without a shred of evidence.”

James shot back Friday, saying, “The NRA’s claimed financial status has finally met its moral status: bankrupt.” She said the group will not avoid accountability or her office with the move.

The NRA said Marschall Smith, a former top executive at 3M Company, will serve as chief restructuring officer.

The group has formed a committee to study opportunities for relocating segments of its business operations to Texas or other states. In the meantime, the NRA’s general business operations will remain in Fairfax.

Here’s the NRA statement:

Fairfax, VA – The National Rifle Association of America (“NRA”) today announced it will restructure the Association as a Texas nonprofit to exit what it believes is a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York. The move will enable long-term, sustainable growth and ensure the NRA’s continued success as the nation’s leading advocate for constitutional freedom – free from the toxic political environment of New York.

The NRA plan, which involves utilizing the protection of the bankruptcy court, has the Association dumping New York and organizing its legal and regulatory matters in an efficient forum. The move comes at a time when the NRA is in its strongest financial condition in years.

The NRA will continue with the forward advancement of the enterprise – confronting anti-Second Amendment activities, promoting firearm safety and training, and advancing public programs across the United States. There will be no immediate changes to the NRA’s operations or workforce.

The Association will seek court approval to reincorporate the Association in the State of Texas – home to more than 400,000 NRA members and site of the 2021 NRA Annual Meeting in Houston.

“This strategic plan represents a pathway to opportunity, growth and progress,” says NRA CEO & EVP Wayne LaPierre. “Obviously, an important part of this plan is ‘dumping New York.’ The NRA is pursuing reincorporating in a state that values the contributions of the NRA, celebrates our law-abiding members, and will join us as a partner in upholding constitutional freedom. This is a transformational moment in the history of the NRA.”

The restructuring plan aims to streamline costs and expenses, proceed with pending litigation in a coordinated and structured manner, and realize many financial and strategic advantages.

The Path Forward

The NRA will move quickly through the restructuring process. Its day-to-day operations, training programs, and Second Amendment advocacy will continue as usual.

By exiting New York, where the NRA has been incorporated for approximately 150 years, the NRA abandons a state where elected officials have weaponized the legal and regulatory powers they wield to penalize the Association and its members for purely political purposes.

In the summer of 2018, then New York Attorney General candidate Letitia James vowed that, if elected, she would use the powers of her office to investigate the “legitimacy” of the NRA.

Without a shred of evidence to support the claim, she called the Association a “terrorist organization” and a “criminal enterprise.” As promised, she commenced an “investigation” upon being elected to the Office of NYAG and, predictably, filed a lawsuit seeking to dissolve the NRA just prior to the November 2020 national election.

The NRA filed a lawsuit in August 2020 against the NYAG similar to its lawsuit against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Department of Financial Services, filed in 2018. The NRA pursues the defendants for attempting to “blacklist” the organization and its financial partners in violation of their First Amendment rights. The NRA will continue those legal actions.

“Under this plan, the Association wisely seeks protection from New York officials who it believes have illegally weaponized their powers against the NRA and its members,” says William A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA in those cases. “The NRA will continue the fight to protect the interests of its members in New York – and all forums where the NRA is unlawfully singled out for its Second Amendment advocacy.”

With respect to its headquarters, the NRA has formed a committee to study opportunities for relocating segments of its business operations to Texas or other states. The Association will analyze whether a move of its headquarters, now located in Fairfax, Virginia, is in the best interests of its members. In the meantime, the NRA’s general business operations will remain in Fairfax.

To facilitate its strategic plan and restructuring, the NRA and one of its subsidiaries filed voluntary chapter 11 petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. Chapter 11 proceedings are routinely utilized by businesses, nonprofits and organizations of all kinds to streamline legal and financial affairs.

The NRA also announced Marschall Smith will serve as Chief Restructuring Officer. A former Senior Vice President and General Counsel of 3M Company, Smith has more than 35 years of legal and business experience with an emphasis on compliance, corporate finance, and corporate governance.

“I am honored to join the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights organization during this important time,” Smith says. “Our goal is to work through the restructuring process efficiently and quickly – even as NRA leadership approaches 2021 with renewed energy and an expanding national platform. This plan has no impact on the NRA’s most important goal: serving its membership and protecting the Second Amendment.”

The NRA will propose a plan that provides for payment in full of all valid creditors’ claims. The Association expects to uphold commitments to employees, vendors, members, and other community stakeholders.

“The plan allows us to protect the NRA and go forward with a renewed focus on Second Amendment advocacy,” says NRA President Carolyn Meadows. “We will continue to honor the trust placed in us by employees, members and other stakeholders – following a blueprint that allows us to become the strongest NRA ever known.”"
One big mystery remains unsolved: Why was the Capitol left unguarded?,65,ky8oea,https://www.salon.com/2021/01/15/one-big-mystery-remains-unsolved-why-was-the-capitol-left-unguarded/,6,1610788427.0,,"This article was co-produced with Press Watch , an independent site that monitors and critiques American political coverage.

There is so much going on these days. But what I keep coming back to is that if the Capitol Police had been anything close to properly mobilized, none of it would have happened.

There would have been a protest on January 6, not an insurrection. Five people wouldn't be dead. Members of Congress and Capitol staff wouldn't have been terrorized. Donald Trump wouldn't be impeached.

Advertisement:

All but for a still inexplicable decision made by who-knows-who.

Because we still don't know how it was allowed to happen.

The other failures after the mob broke through the shoddy Capitol Police lines are hugely significant — including the long delay in help from federal law enforcement and the National Guard. But the Capitol Police, with its 2,100 sworn officers and staggering half-billion-dollar budget, could easily have contained the mob if it had actually tried.

Advertisement:

That's a force bigger than the entire Atlanta Police Department, and with more than twice the budget. They could have defended the Capitol if they wanted to.

Reporting on this topic has been highly unsatisfactory. The only article I've seen that gets close to indicating the depths of that failure was by Colleen Long, Michael Balsamo and Lisa Mascaro of the Associated Press, who wrote on Monday:

Despite ample warnings about pro-Trump demonstrations in Washington, U.S. Capitol Police did not bolster staffing on Wednesday and made no preparations for the possibility that the planned protests could escalate into massive violent riots, according to several people briefed on law enforcement's response.

Consider:

The department had the same number of officers in place as on a routine day. While some of those officers were outfitted with equipment for a protest, they were not staffed or equipped for a riot…. No fencing was erected outside the Capitol and no contingency plans were prepared in case the situation escalated, according to people briefed.

And officers were told not to shoot:

Once the mob began to move on the Capitol, a police lieutenant issued an order not to use deadly force, which explains why officers outside the building did not draw their weapons as the crowd closed in. Officers are sometimes ordered against escalating a situation by drawing their weapons if superiors believe doing so could lead to a stampede or a shootout.

It's dead wrong to call this an ""intelligence failure."" The FBI may not have felt it had enough evidence before Jan. 6 to arrest people, but it was common knowledge — amply supported by multiple, widely-shared intelligence reports — that Trump supporters would head to the Capitol after his rally, that those supporters expressed an intention to ""stop"" what Congress was doing, and that some of them had a history of violence.

It was a colossal policing failure. But why?

Speaks to motive

I have tried to consider the possibility that it was just gross incompetence. But no one could really be that incompetent.

So at this point, in the absence of any other plausible explanations, it is more than reasonable to assume that the people making decisions about Capitol Police deployment that day felt kinship with the Trump mob, and either were too racist to see the threat posed by Trump supporters or looked the other way on purpose.

Advertisement:

We need to know which it was.

Although no one has come forth with first-hand knowledge, it is abundantly obvious — and has been, from the first few minutes of the siege — that the Capitol Police as a whole enjoyed a comfort level with this mob that they wouldn't have felt with any other — or, more specifically, with the ""other.""

As Masha Gessen wrote for the New Yorker, just a day later:

Advertisement:

Black Lives Matter protesters are other to the Capitol Police. So are survivors of sexual assault or women who protest for the right to choose. But an armed mob storming the Capitol, and their Instigator-in-Chief, are, apparently, familiar enough to be dismissed as clowns.

As newly-elected Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo. — a veteran of many Black Lives Matter protests — put it on MSNBC: ""Had it been people who look like me, had it been the same amount of people, but had they been Black and brown, we wouldn't have made it up those steps. … We would have been shot, we would have been tear-gassed.""

So did the Capitol Police leadership simply not believe that a group of white Trump supporters was capable of violence? Or did they think that even if they got inside the building, they wouldn't do any harm?

And most importantly: Was there any collusion? Did anyone suggest they look the other way?

Reporters should be trying to get hold of communications between Capitol Police leadership, including the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, and any other party, in which Jan. 6 was mentioned.

Advertisement:

Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who has since resigned, has said he held a video conference with the FBI to discuss security planning in the days before the siege. We deserve to know exactly what was said.

The FBI had a command center set up in its Washington field office before and during the siege. We know that FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich was there, among probably dozens of others from all over the government. What did they know and when did they know it? Did anyone there understand why the Capitol was left so unguarded? When did they realize it was a problem? When did they realize they had to do something about it? (Eventually, several hundred FBI, ATF and U.S. marshals were sent to the scene, as well as the National Guard.)

At any point, when decisions were made to underreact, were political appointees involved?

Reporters should ask every Capitol Police officer they can find: What did you think your orders were, and why? And what were communications like during the siege?

Advertisement:

One of the few data points we have is from a BuzzFeed article by Emmanuel Felton, who interviewed two Black Capitol Police officers. One told him: ""Our chief was nowhere to be found, I didn't hear him on the radio. One of our other deputy chiefs was not there. You don't think it's all hands on deck?""

The officers said that ""upper management"" had told them to prepare as they would for any other protest.

The officers, Felton wrote, ""said they were wrong-footed, fighting off an invading force that their managers had downplayed and not prepared them for.""

A huge error of judgment was made. But how high — and low — did it go?

Advertisement:

Depends what you mean by ""intelligence""

Official Washington has certainly not been making it easy for reporters to get answers to their questions, which is cause for suspicion all on its own.

Senior officials like FBI Director Chris Wray, and acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen appear to be in hiding. Rosen released what looked like a hostage video of himself at midnight Tuesday on YouTube, in which he mouthed platitudes.

To this day, the federal government has not held a single real briefing — by which I mean a briefing of any substance, with a chance for reporters to ask multiple questions and follow-ups.

The public face of the FBI is now Steven D'Antuono, who heads the Washington field office. He profoundly muddled the narrative last week when he told reporters that ""there was no indication"" of anything planned for Jan. 6 ""other than First-Amendment protected activity.""

That simply wasn't true. And in what the Justice Department attempted to pass off as a briefing on Tuesday, D'Antuono described plenty of what normal people would consider such indications — maybe not enough to arrest specific individuals, but more than enough to warn other agencies about what was coming.

And warn they did.

Here's what D'Antuono said:

The FBI receives enormous amounts of information and intelligence. And our job is to determine the credibility and viability of it under the laws and policies that govern FBI investigations. We have to separate the aspirational from the intentional and determine which of the individuals saying despicable things on the internet are just practicing keyboard bravado, or they actually have the intent to do harm. In the latter, we work diligently to identify them and prevent them from doing so. As offensive as a statement can be, the FBI cannot open an investigation without a threat of violence or alleged criminal activity. However, when that language does turn to a call of violence or criminal activity, the FBI is able to undertake investigative action. And in this case, we had no indication information was linked to any specific person, but this is a matter of an online discussion. This information was immediately disseminated through a written product and briefed through our command post operations to all levels of law enforcement.

So even though it was raw and sometimes unspecific intelligence, they shared it. Everyone knew.

(Please note his use of the term ""keyboard bravado."" Apparently, when white guys discuss plans to attack the Capitol, that's not a terrorist threat, that's ""keyboard bravado"". When brown or Black people do it, the FBI goes into hysterics: Far too often, costly attempted stings, complete with entrapment by undercover informants, ensue.)

NBC's Pete Williams, to his great credit, started off the brief, no-follow-ups-allowed Q&A with exactly the right question:

So can you clarify for us, what intelligence did the FBI gather before the assault on the Capitol about the potential for violence, and how did it share it — and did it share it — to the Capitol Police?

D'Antuono dodged, saying generally that the FBI had received ""a lot of intelligence and information"" through social media and confidential informants, and that the information had been shared through the city's ""very robust"" joint terrorism task force, which of course includes the Capitol Police.

Reporters need to see that information.

A few days earlier, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, had been a tad more forthcoming in an interview with NPR's Martin Kaste:

Q. I'm sure you have many sources of intel before an event like this. Did you get warnings about the possibility of violence? A. Of course, there were warnings. I mean, look, you scrub social media, there is all types of intelligence indications. So, of course, there were warnings on social media, the different platforms, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and we were cognizant of those. There's always outliers but, yeah, there were warnings that people were going to coalesce and protest, and some individuals said, ""Yeah, we're going to take back our house."" So, yeah, those warnings were out there.

ProPublica's Sebastian Rotella reported that the FBI had actually acted on some of that intelligence:

FBI officials managed to dissuade people in several places from their suspected plans, a senior FBI official said — but there was not enough evidence to issue arrest warrants. ""Prior to this event, the FBI obtained information about individuals who were planning on potentially traveling to the protests, individuals who were planning to engage in violence,"" said the senior FBI official. ""The FBI was able to discourage those individuals from traveling to D.C.""

Rotella noted:

The FBI shared intelligence about potential threats with the Capitol Police, which has been part of the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force in Washington since 1995. But for reasons that remain unclear, a much-criticized security deployment by the police was unable to prevent the storming of the Capitol on Wednesday.

So everybody with half a brain knew what might be coming. The only question is whether they cared.

Who made the call?

It seems like the only person in Capitol Police leadership who's been talking to reporters is the former chief, Steven Sund, who has given only two interviews, both to the Washington Post.

Although he is the single person most clearly responsible for what may be the most historic police failure in American history, he has accepted no blame, while using the Post to spread the blame to others.

In Sund's telling, for instance, it was the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms who blocked his attempt to request help from the National Guard. While that technically may have an element of truth to it, it certainly doesn't explain why Sund didn't even mobilize his own officers, choosing instead to leave them as sitting ducks behind tiny fences. He denied knowing about one particular FBI warning, but that means nothing.

House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, appointed by John Boehner in 2012, quickly resigned and hasn't been heard from since.

Michael Stenger, a former Secret Service agent whom Mitch McConnell installed as Senate sergeant-at-arms in 2018 (and who also resigned on Jan. 7) certainly comes off as a pathetic figure.

The Washington Post's Karoun Demirjian, Carol D. Leonnig, Paul Kane and Aaron C. Davis described a scene during the siege when ""a large group of senators were secretly led to a room in a Senate office building. Stenger was with them, and the furious lawmakers peppered him with questions"":

""How does this happen? How does this happen?"" demanded Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) Stenger could not muster much of an answer, practically inaudible as he dispiritedly debriefed the senators. ""He was talking in circles,"" Graham thought to himself. Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., called Stenger's attempt to field that question ""absolutely pathetic"" and further reduced confidence in the room. As Graham pressed for a better explanation, Stenger's voice got weaker and smaller. … Finally, the Senate sergeant at arms sat down amid the others in the room, saying to no one in particular: ""I wish I had just retired last week.""

We need much more reporting about what these and other top officials did and why.

Judgment must come

Although initial reports appropriately focused on the Capitol Police's incompetent — and, in some cases, downright affable — response to the mob, we've learned since that some officers behaved admirably.

Videos shows dozens of them trying to push back the invaders. One officer, Eugene Goodman, may have saved the lives of many senators by single-handedly blocking and then luring away from the Senate chamber a group of angry rioters.

If it weren't important enough already to know how this massive, historic failure took place — and what we can learn from it — distinguishing between the heroes, on one hand, and the cowards and appeasers, on the other, is essential journalism."
America’s Biggest Owner Of Farmland Is Now Bill Gates,0,ky5v4n,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2021/01/14/americas-biggest-owner-of-farmland-is-now-bill-gates-bezos-turner/amp/?sh=3a9e7b726096&__twitter_impression=true,18,1610779456.0,,"Corbis via Getty Images

Bill Gates, the fourth richest person in the world and a self-described nerd who is known for his early programming skills rather than his love of the outdoors, has been quietly snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S. — enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.

After years of reports that he was purchasing agricultural land in places like Florida and Washington, The Land Report revealed that Gates, who has a net worth of nearly $121 billion according to Forbes, has built up a massive farmland portfolio spanning 18 states. His largest holdings are in Louisiana (69,071 acres), Arkansas (47,927 acres) and Nebraska (20,588 acres). Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.

According to The Land Report’s research, the land is held directly and through third-party entities by Cascade Investments, Gates’ personal investment vehicle. Cascade’s other investments include food-safety company Ecolab, used-car retailer Vroom and Canadian National Railway.

While it may be surprising that a tech billionaire would also be the biggest farmland owner in the country, this is not Gates’ only foray into agriculture. In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced $306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The foundation has further invested in the development and proliferation of “super crops” resistant to climate change and higher-yield dairy cows. Last year, the organization announced Gates Ag One, a nonprofit to advance those efforts.

It is not entirely clear how Gates’ farmland is being used, or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation. (Cascade did not return Forbes’ request for comment.) However, there is some indication that the land could be used in a way that aligns with the foundation’s values. Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade, is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections of crops, soil and water resources.

Gates is not the only billionaire on The Land Report’s list of top private farmland owners. Wonderful Company cofounders Stewart and Lynda Resnick (net worth: $7.1 billion) ranked number three with 190,000 acres. Their farmland produces the goods for their brands including POM Wonderful, Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Halos mandarins.

While Gates may be the country’s biggest farmland owner, he by no means is the largest individual landowner. In its list of 100 top American landowners, The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone, who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests. CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land across eight states. Even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is investing in land on a large scale, landing the 25th spot with his ownership of 420,000 acres, mainly in west Texas."
‘He has an obligation to them’: Attorney for ‘QAnon shaman’ asks Trump to pardon rioters,69,ky30dv,https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/15/attorney-qanon-shaman-trump-pardon-459608,31,1610771117.0,,"On Tuesday, Chansley became one of the first three people indicted by federal prosecutors in connection with the violence at the Capitol. He was charged with a felony violation of the Federal Anti-Riot Act, as well as obstruction of Congress and other offenses.

In a filing on Thursday, prosecutors said Chansley was as “an active participant in” and “the most prominent symbol of” what they described as a “violent insurrection.” Prosecutors also said Chansley had expressed his intention of returning to Washington, D.C., for President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration next week.

The language in the filing suggests more severe charges, such as sedition or insurrection, could be coming for those involved in the siege.

Watkins, Chansley’s attorney, said on Thursday that his client, “like a lot of other disenfranchised people in our country, felt very, very, very solidly in sync” with the president — suggesting Chansley was incited to storm the Capitol in Trump’s name.

“He felt like his voice was, for the first time, being heard,” Watkins said. “And what ended up happening, over the course of the lead-up to the election, over the course of the period from the election to Jan. 6 — it was a driving force by a man he hung his hat on, he hitched his wagon to. He loved Trump. Every word, he listens to him.”

Prior to the Capitol siege, the president, his family members and his political allies riled up his supporters at a rally on the White House Ellipse. When it was his turn to speak, Trump urged those in attendance to march on the Capitol amid Congress’ certification of Biden’s Electoral College victory.

“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said. He also said that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”

On Thursday, Trump became the only president in American history to be impeached twice — this time, in a bipartisan vote on a single count of “incitement of insurrection.”

“We all have to understand that the words that were spoken by the president meant something, not just to my client. They meant something to a lot of people,” Watkins said in his interview.

“They listened to those words. And those words meant something to them. And they had a right to rely on the words of their president that was strewed forth worldwide,” he said. “And they did. And now they’re turning around [and] they’re getting arrested, as well many should be.”

Nevertheless, Trump “needs to stand up and own these people,” Watkins argued. “He has an obligation to them. He has an obligation to our nation. It’s not going to happen.”

Pressed by host Chris Cuomo on what exactly he would like Trump to do, Watkins replied: “Oh, give a pardon.”

As Chansley’s attorney, “my role is not to judge somebody. My role is to be an advocate,” Watkins said. “If there’s one iota of a chance that the guy who’s the president of our country — who invited everybody down Pennsylvania [Avenue] — will give my client a pardon, you know what? I’m going to do it.”

Watkins acknowledged, however, that his plea was unlikely to succeed. “Am I holding my breath thinking that Donald Trump is going to be sitting around going, ‘You know what? … What’s the name of that guy with the horns? Yeah … let’s give him a pardon.’”

But “with Trump, you never know,” Watkins said. “He may say, ‘I want the guy with the horns.’ Next thing you know, maybe he’s represented by the shaman instead of Rudy Giuliani.”

Watkins went on to compare the president’s supporters who stormed the Capitol to the Jonestown cult members who committed mass suicide at their settlement in Guyana in 1978: “You know the only thing different here? There’s no Kool-Aid.”"

White House aides slammed over ‘illegal’ removal of government artwork,30,ky10we,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-white-house-art-removed-illegal-national-archives-b1787948.html,7,1610765411.0,,"A top aide to President Donald Trump was seen leaving the White House with a large framed photograph, stirring controversy as former officials alleged that the move was “illegal” and said the artwork belonged to the National Archives.

Peter Navarro, a top trade official in the Trump administration, was photographed by a Reuters journalist leaving the White House grounds earlier this week with the image of Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

It is not immediately clear whether or not Mr Navarro paid the US government for the photograph before removing it from the White House. Requests for comment from The Independent were not returned.

But some people who saw the Trump official leaving the White House with the photo declined to give him the benefit of the doubt and alleged that the move was illegal. These included Kenneth Baer, associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under former President Barack Obama.

“This is illegal. These photos belong to the American people, and go to the National Archives,” Mr Baer wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. “I know this as when I left the WH in 2012, I wanted to take with me the photo I had of @BarackObama and the 2008 World Champion @Phillies.”

Other items were seen being carried out of the White House – the wife of one official was seen loading a stuffed pheasant into a car – though the specific circumstances surrounding each item remained unclear.

Some former officials said it was possible to buy certain government photographs, including Jon Wolfsthal, a national security aide under Mr Obama, who recalled in a response to Mr Baer how he purchased artwork before leaving the White House.

“The frame has to stay,” he noted.

The Trump administration was seen throughout the week packing up offices across the West Wing ahead of Inauguration Day, as President-elect Joe Biden was set to be sworn in on the footsteps of the US Capitol.

"With partial blame for the Capitol attack, majority favors barring Trump from office",25,ky0scd,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/partial-blame-capitol-attack-majority-favors-barring-trump/story?id=75251123,3,1610764747.0,,"With partial blame for the Capitol attack, majority favors barring Trump from office Fifty-four percent also say Trump should be charged with inciting a riot.

Nine in 10 Americans oppose the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, seven in 10 say Donald Trump bears at least some responsibility for it and a majority in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll – 56% – favors efforts in Congress to bar him from holding elected office again.

Fifty-four percent in the national survey also say Trump should be charged criminally with inciting a riot for having encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol. More, 66%, say he has behaved irresponsibly, more broadly, in his statements and actions since the election.

Half the public, 51%, say the events of the past week in Washington, D.C., left them less confident in the stability of democracy in the United States. That said, just 20% are pessimistic about the future of the U.S. system of government, about the average in polling back to the 1970s.

See PDF for full results, charts and tables.

Further, while Trump’s claims of widespread fraud have raised fears he would undermine confidence in U.S. elections, Americans by 2-1, 62-31%, see no solid evidence for these claims. And the public by 63-36% expresses confidence in the electoral system overall. At the same time, confidence in the electoral system dives to 35% among Republicans, and, following their leader’s line, 65% of Republicans say they think there’s solid evidence of fraud.

The poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds Trump leaving office with a 38% job approval rating; 60% disapprove, matching (but not exceeding) his peak disapproval in August 2018. His career average approval rating is the lowest for any president in modern polling, back to 1939, and he is the first president in that time never to achieve majority approval at any point.

Fifty-nine percent expect him to be seen in history as a below-average president, including nearly half, 48%, who rate his tenure as “poor,” the most in polling dating to Gerald Ford in 1976. As noted, 56% favor Congress removing him from the presidency and barring him from holding elected office again – exceeding the 47% who supported his removal from office in his first impeachment last year.

Looking ahead, Americans by a wide margin say Republican officials should lead the party in a different direction rather than follow Trump’s leadership, 69-26%. But just among Republicans, a majority, 60%, wants to continue to follow Trump -- sharply fewer than in the past (83% in a similar question in 2018), but still marking the risk of a Trump/no Trump schism within the party.

Indeed, while 52% of all Americans say Republican leaders who supported Trump’s effort to overturn the election “went too far,” just 16% of Republicans say so, compared with 81% of Democrats and 54% of independents. And Trump maintains a 79% job approval rating in his own party, with 64% approving strongly.

The challenge for the Republicans, in what may or not be their post-Trump era, is how to straddle that continued in-party approval for the president with views outside the base. Among the predominant political group, independents -- often swing voters -- approval of Trump plummets to 35%, with 62% disapproving.

The riot

Given the sharp differences on most political issues between partisan groups, one result in the survey stands out for its level of agreement: Eighty-nine percent of Americans oppose the actions of the people who stormed the Capitol, including 80% who are strongly opposed. Eight percent are in support, with strong support at 5%.

Support for those who stormed the Capitol reaches 15% among conservatives and Republicans alike, and 19% among people who approve of Trump’s job performance. Still, even among Trump approvers, 76% are opposed, including 60% strongly opposed.

Partisan and ideological gaps widen on other issues. Sixty-six percent of Republicans think Trump has acted responsibly since the election; 26% of independents and 5% of Democrats agree. Similarly, 65% of Republicans think there is solid evidence for Trump’s claims of voter fraud, falling to three in 10 independents and 4% of Democrats.

When it comes to the events of the past week, 42% of Republicans think Trump bears at least some responsibility for the attack on the U.S. Capitol; that rises sharply to 72% of independents and 93% of Democrats. Many fewer Republicans, 12%, think Congress should remove Trump from office and disqualify him from holding elected office in the future, vs. nearly six in 10 independents and nine in 10 Democrats.

In terms of Trump’s legacy, three in 10 conservatives and a quarter of Republicans think he’ll go down in history as a below average president. That compares with 60% of independents, 71% of moderates, 86% of liberals and 89% of Democrats.

Even with his comparatively higher support among Republicans, fewer respondents report having voted for Trump than actually did in November, suggesting that some one-time supporters are shying away from him -- further evidenced by 19% disapproval in his own party, near his career high. Indeed, in recalled vote, Trump’s support is comparatively low among non-conservative Republicans, who also are more critical than their conservative counterparts of his post-election actions. (Note, though, that the sample size of non-conservative Republicans is a small one; 72% of Republicans identify themselves as conservatives.)

Those who report having voted for Trump two and a half months ago, by contrast, by and large are not expressing buyer’s remorse: Ninety-one percent in this group say if the election were rerun today, they’d vote for him again.

Approval

Trump’s approval rating is down 6 points from the last national ABC/Post poll in October. In contrast, most recent outgoing presidents have seen a bump in approval in their final days -- +5 points for Barack Obama in the last ABC/Post survey of his presidency, +5 for Bill Clinton and +7 for George Bush. Approval of George W. Bush, struggling with economic crisis and the unpopular war in Iraq, was just +3 points from December 2008, but +10 from the previous October.

Several elements of Trump’s closing approval rating stand out:

Disapproval among whites, 52%, matches the high in this group (from August 2017), and 49% of whites disapprove strongly, a record high. Disapproval grows to 75% among Hispanics and 89% among Black people.

Sixty-eight percent of women disapprove of Trump’s job performance, matching the high (also in August 2017), compared with 52% of men. This includes 56% disapproval among non-college educated white women, an important part of Trump’s coalition; in the ABC News exit poll, 63% of them supported him for reelection just in November.

Approval of Trump’s work in office is at record lows among seniors (37% approve) and higher-income Americans (33%). Approval among suburban residents, a sharply contested political group, is down 11 points from October, to 38%.

Whatever Trump’s role in the nation’s political future, the results make clear that his presidency -- and especially the events of last week -- have left deep divisions, not only in political attitudes, but also in views of American democracy. While, as noted, just 20% are outright pessimistic about the U.S. system of government, only 30% are optimistic -- near the low, and well off the average in polls back 46 years, 43%. The plurality, 48%, is uncertain.

Justice Dept. watchdog opens probe of response to riot,249,kxxu4n,https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-politics-519a8d22b0997b50a993e4799c29e491,12,1610756526.0,,"Members of the National Guard walk past the Dome of the Capitol Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 14, 2021.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal watchdogs launched a sweeping review of how the FBI, the Pentagon and other law enforcement agencies responded to the riot at the U.S. Capitol, including whether there were failures in information sharing and other preparations that left the historic symbol of democracy vulnerable to assault by a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters.

The inquiries, undertaken by the inspectors general for the departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Interior and Defense, could result in searing criticism of the government’s handling of a deadly breach at the Capitol in which armed loyalists of Trump overran the police and came in close contact with elected officials. The reviews will encompass everything from whether the FBI adequately shared information with other law enforcement agencies about the potential for violence to how the Pentagon mobilized for the Jan. 6 crisis.

The initiation of the coordinated inquiries comes as failings in the government’s preparation and response are coming into sharper focus more than a week after the riot.

The Capitol Police, for instance, has said it had planned for free speech activity at the Capitol but not for the sort of violence that erupted as lawmakers assembled to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. The lack of preparation is notable since Trump himself had encouraged his supporters to come to Washington and had called on them to “fight like hell” at a rally shortly before the riot.

The Pentagon has said the Capitol Police turned down an offer for help days before the riot. Once it became clear on the day of the event that more substantial aid would be needed, it was a logistically complicated struggle to bring in a larger force to back up the embattled police. Now, the Defense Department inspector general will review the Pentagon’s “roles, responsibilities, and actions” in preparing for and responding to the riot.

At the Justice Department, the inspector general investigation will examine whether information was adequately shared with other agencies, including the Capitol Police, about the potential for violence.

The inspector general said it “also will assess whether there are any weaknesses in DOJ protocols, policies, or procedures that adversely affected the ability of DOJ or its components to prepare effectively for and respond to the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6.”

The review will almost certainly include an assessment of intelligence that the Justice Department — and particularly the FBI — had collected before and after the riot.

Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, said last week that there had been “no indication” of anything other than First Amendment activity. Days later, The Washington Post revealed the existence of a Jan. 5 report from the FBI’s field office in Norfolk that cited an online thread with detailed threats from extremists to be ready for “war.”

D’Antuono later characterized the warning as a “thread on a message board” that was not attributable to any particular person, suggesting there was not much that could be done with that information. He said the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Washington.

Full Coverage: Capitol siege

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general office said it would look into the response of its component agencies, focusing in part on the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. That unit issues alerts to law enforcement agencies around the country.

The Interior Department’s internal watchdog, meanwhile, will review the actions of the Park Police, including how it handled law enforcement on the Ellipse, the site of Trump’s speech to supporters at a rally before the riot.

Trump explodes at Nixon comparisons as he prepares to leave office,44,kxmmlf,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/politics/donald-trump-presidency-ending/index.html,31,1610712463.0,,"(CNN) In his final days in office, President Donald Trump has found the parts of the job he loved replaced by cold legal warnings, forced video addresses and a shrinking circle of downtrodden aides , all anxiously wondering what life will be like after noon on January 20.

Gone are the clicks of flashing cameras. Absent is the roar of a cheering crowd. Instead of a commanding final full week of winning, the President is playing the role of victim and not a gracious leader departing office.

Trump has been consumed by the unraveling of his presidency during his last days in office, according to people around him, which included a casual discussion among advisers recently about a possible resignation.

Trump shut the idea down almost immediately. And he has made clear to aides in separate conversations that mere mention of President Richard Nixon, the last president to resign, was banned.

He told one adviser during an expletive-laden conversation recently never to bring up the ex-president ever again. During the passing mention of resigning this week, Trump told people he couldn't count on Vice President Mike Pence to pardon him like Gerald Ford did Nixon, anyway.

Eager for a final taste of the pomp of being president, Trump has asked for a major send-off on Inauguration Day next week, according to people familiar with the matter, before one last presidential flight to Palm Beach.

But the signs of his impending departure are everywhere -- including right outside his window. Workers hung bunting Thursday that read ""2021 Biden-Harris Inauguration"" from temporary stands across from the White House North Portico. It was visible from his third-story residence.

Inside the building, Trump has been weathering a second impeachment and growing isolation from his onetime allies in sullen desolation. He has grown more and more worried about what legal or financial calamities may await him when he is no longer president, people who have spoken to him said, fueled by warnings from lawyers and advisers. He is weighing pardons, including for himself and his family, as he attempts to muster a legal team for another impeachment trial. And he is resentful of Republicans who he feels abandoned him in his hour of need, including the GOP leaders of the House and Senate.

Aides have pleaded with Trump to deliver some type of farewell address, either live or taped, that would tick through his accomplishments in office. But he has appeared disinterested and noncommittal. On Thursday, it was Pence carrying out tasks ordinarily left to a president, like visiting national guardsmen posted at the US Capitol or visiting White House operators to say farewell.

Closing up shop

With less than a week left in office, Trump's staff is preparing to leave the White House campus for a final time. Many officials have already departed, but those who are still coming into the office have focused on the offboarding process and packing up their offices. There were signs of moving activity Thursday, including a gray van from the fine art movers Crozier. Debbie Meadows, the wife of the chief of staff, was spotted carrying out a stuffed pheasant from her husband's office and loading it into her car.

The upstairs of the White House press shop now sits virtually empty. Desks where assistants used to sit outside the office of the press secretary are now vacant, with the exception of boxes and stacks of documents. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who has been largely invisible during the final days of the Trump White House, has also started packing up her office.

One of Trump's Cabinet officials, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appeared on television from Palm Beach. Another official, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow, received applause from junior aides as he left the building.

As one of their final acts, Trump's team is working to organize a crowd to see him off on the morning of Biden's inauguration, when he plans to depart Washington while still president and is expecting a major send-off. Even though some of his allies had encouraged him to attend Biden's inauguration, and Trump quizzed his circle on whether he should, few ever expected him to participate in the swearing-in of his successor.

Trump told people he did not like the idea of departing Washington for a final time as an ex-president, flying aboard an airplane no longer known as Air Force One. He also did not particularly like the thought of requesting the use of the plane from Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter.

For now, Trump is undecided on whether he will pen a letter to Biden to leave in the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Some of his advisers have encouraged him to think about continuing the tradition. Early in his presidency, Trump liked to show off to visitors the letter he received from President Barack Obama , which included the now-prescient line: ""Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it's up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.""

Initially, Trump had planned to depart the White House a day early. But he now plans to leave on the morning of January 20. His departure aboard Marine One from the White House South Lawn will likely be visible and audible to the Bidens, who will spend the night before the inauguration at Blair House, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the executive mansion. Its use was offered to them by the State Department rather than the Trumps, who refuse to make contact with the incoming president and first lady.

Final plans for Trump's departure were still being laid a week ahead of time, but Trump has expressed interest to some in a military-style sendoff and a crowd of supporters, according to a person with whom he has discussed the matter. Whether that occurs at the White House, Joint Base Andrews or his final destination -- Palm Beach International Airport -- wasn't clear. Trump is expected to be ensconced in his Mar-a-Lago club or his nearby golf course by noon on Inauguration Day, when his term officially ends.

Having the outgoing president 1,000 miles away from the incoming one provides some logistical challenges. For instance, handoff of the nuclear football -- a 45-pound briefcase that accompanies the president everywhere he goes in case of nuclear attack -- won't be as simple as it would be if the two men were in each other's vicinity.

A person familiar with the matter said the White House Military Office will ensure there are multiple nuclear footballs -- one to accompany Trump to Florida and one that will be ready in Washington for when Biden officially becomes president. The nuclear codes Trump carries on a card alongside the football -- the so-called ""biscuit"" -- would no longer work past noon.

Legal and financial troubles

Though Trump, in private, still contends he won the 2020 election, he has fully resigned himself to leaving the White House and entering life as a private citizen -- and with it the potential legal exposure and business troubles sparked by his role in inciting the riots last week.

The first order of business will be his second impeachment trial, which is now set to begin after Biden is sworn in. Trump is still enlisting lawyers to represent him during the proceedings, and appears to have soured on Rudy Giuliani , whose legal fees he has ordered aides not to pay. A band of Trump associates had worked recently to dissuade the President from listening to Giuliani because they believed he was providing him with misinformation.

Instead, Trump is looking to a new set of attorneys, including potentially John Eastman, the conservative attorney who falsely told Trump that Pence could block the certification of Biden's win. A person familiar with the matter said Eastman could join Trump's legal team defending him in the upcoming impeachment trial.

Trump's senior advisers in the White House have said they don't believe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will vote to convict him, but is happy to let the option hang over his head during his final days in the White House, given his deep anger at the President.

According to those around him, Trump has been more focused on potential post-presidency legal woes since well before the November election, and his worry has increased in the months since, people familiar with the matter said.

Yet he has also been lashing out at aides, allies and lawyers trying to protect him from criminal exposure following his role in inciting rioters during last week's insurrection attempt at the US Capitol. Some of his attorneys have tried to explain that his notion of a self-pardon may not hold up, which has led some inside Trump's circle to believe he is less likely to attempt it before he leaves office.

Those concerns are partly what helped convince Trump to record a video on Wednesday condemning the riots and insisting they did not reflect his political movement.

""No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag,"" he said from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.

Trump had seemed reluctant to tape the video, in part because he believes the carefully denunciations of his supporters make him look like he's caving to pressure to tone down his stance on the election.

A source familiar with conversations said there was a coordinated full-court press by allies and aides, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, chief of staff Mark Meadows and senior adviser Jared Kushner to convince the President he had to come out forcefully against further violence and that if he didn't -- and another incident happened -- he would ""own it.""

""Silence is not an option,"" the source said in describing one of the conversations. ""We need to break the cycle.""

After an ad-libbed video on the day of the insurrection attempt, Trump's subsequent appearances have been more tightly scripted, with heavy input from the White House counsel's office on the text. Trump has read them from teleprompters set up by the White House Communications Agency as senior officials look on, ensuring he does not diverge from the words as written.

While Trump has long fretted about his potential legal troubles, it has only been recently that he has weighed anxiously the potential business downsides to his divisive tenure. The decision by the PGA this week to strip his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course of a championship tournament infuriated the President.

Another discussion that could be hampered by the fallout from the riot he helped stoke is his presidential library. Before Trump's rabble-rousing speech, there had been talk of securing property in Florida and having Dan Scavino, his longtime aide, run it. But now there are questions about who would donate to Trump's library in the current climate.

For a man highly attuned to the kind of pomp he believes affirms his elevated position in life, the abrupt removal of the PGA honor came as a blow not only to his bottom line but to his ego. And it provided an unpleasant harbinger of the life he might lead once he leaves office, without the fanfare that accompanied his every move as president.

This week has provided him a preview of sorts. He has remained behind closed doors for most days, with no cameras documenting his moves and no audiences to applaud him as he goes about his day. The circle of obsequious aides that have surrounded him for most of his term is shrinking, replaced by only a few -- such as Scavino and personnel chief Johnny McEntee -- who will remain with him until he departs the White House.

The President has been discussing his election conspiracy theories with his former chief strategist Steve Bannon -- who's facing federal fraud charges -- in recent weeks, a senior Trump adviser confirmed, as he pushes away advisers who tell him what he doesn't want to hear.

Events that would ordinarily be open to press, such as ceremonies awarding the Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts, have been limited to only government cameras.

According to one official, aides worried that Trump might respond off-the-cuff to a question about the riots and veer from the carefully scripted comments condemning the actions. They determined it was better to limit Trump's opportunities before the media.

No Bail for QAnon Believer Who Texted ‘War Time’ and Threatened to Kill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,600,kxgr81,https://lawandcrime.com/u-s-capitol-siege/no-bail-for-qanon-believer-who-texted-war-time-and-threatened-to-kill-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi/,12,1610692959.0,,"A U.S. Magistrate Judge on Thursday ruled a QAnon adherent arrested in connection with last week’s deadly protests at the capitol building in Washington, D.C., should not be released from bail before his trial.

On the day of the U.S. Capitol siege, that man, Cleveland Grover Meredith, Jr. received a text message from an undisclosed person stating “Pence blew it.” Meredith replied with two words: “War time.” That’s according to court papers seeking his continued pretrial detention.

Prosecutors note that Meredith never made it to the riot; rather, he arrived late to the insurrection. He drove his truck from Colorado to the nation’s capital, only to be intercepted by authorities who found an enormous stash of weapons in his vehicle after learning of his alleged threat to kill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Meredith’s chilling words became public in court papers on Wednesday, including his floating an assassination plot against Pelosi: “Thinking about heading over to Pelosi CUNT’s speech and putting a bullet in her noggin on Live TV.”

“If I had a more concerning threats case before me, I do not remember it,” Judge G. Michael Harvey ruled, adding that the alleged actions qualify as a “crime of violence.”

The decision fell a day after outgoing President Donald Trump‘s second impeachment for inciting an insurrection.

Imagining a conversation with a hypothetical FBI agent surveilling his communications, Meredith allegedly seethed: “You get that one Mr. Marxist FBI Agent? Go FK yourself.”

Pelosi wasn’t the only female politician against whom prosecutors believe Meredith targeted misogynist rage: “I may wander over to the [office of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser] and put a 5.56 in her skull, FKG cunt.”

Meredith’s public defender, Ubong Akpan, argued that her client has been charged with a statute criminalizing threats to kidnap, which she claimed would not meet the threshold of a “crime of violence” under the relevant precedent.

Finding that unconvincing, Harvey said: “A threat to trick someone into being kidnapped, that makes no sense to me.”

Assistant U.S. Attorney Ahmet Baset said Meredith traveled from Colorado to D.C. in order to “participate in a violent insurrection” on Jan. 6, which the prosecutor called one of the most “hellish” days in the history of our nation’s capital.

Though defense attorney Akpan claimed her client intended his messages as a “joke,” prosecutors noted that the physical evidence suggests otherwise. Meredith wrote that he wanted to use “armor piercing bullets,” a form of ammunition that “just so happened” to be found in his vehicle, the prosecutor noted.

Baset added that the claim was also inconsistent with Meredith’s FBI interview.

Asked by the FBI about whether his threats were serious or a joke, Meredith replied: “It’s a little of both,” according to Baset.

“Clearly this is someone who relished in the carnage,” Baset told the judge, referring to his reaction to the assault on the Capitol. “He relished [it], even after seeing what had happened.”

During his short time in Washington, D.C., Meredith assaulted a city resident whom he head-butted in an act of “road rage” and then called someone the N-word, prosecutors say.

Prosecutors revealed that Meredith believed in the QAnon conspiracy theory.

China tosses more obstacles at WHO team investigating pandemic’s origin,30,kxb976,https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/china-tosses-more-obstacles-at-who-team-investigating-pandemics-origin/,3,1610676970.0,,"Chinese authorities have held up two scientists sent to Wuhan, China, by the World Health Organization to investigate the origins of the novel coronavirus—yet another obstacle the Chinese government has thrown at the health agency’s efforts to understand how the devastating pandemic began.

The two scientists were traveling as part of an international team of 15 that has long been working to gain access to the city where the virus first emerged in late 2019. Thirteen of the scientists—who all repeatedly tested negative for the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in their home countries—were allowed to travel on. They have now arrived in Wuhan, the WHO said on Twitter earlier today. However, China is still requiring the 13 scientists to undergo a 14-day quarantine in Wuhan.

The two scientists held back also tested negative for the virus multiple times prior to traveling. But while in Singapore en route to Wuhan, they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggesting past exposure to the virus. Despite their negative PCR tests, Chinese authorities had them remain in Singapore for additional testing.

On its own, the holdup of two scientists may seem like a minor travel snag. But it’s just the latest obstacle in the scientific effort to study how SARS-CoV-2 jumped from animals to humans.

Last year, China dismissed requests from Australia, the US, and other countries to let independent scientific investigators have access to Wuhan to study the origins of the virus. In July, the Chinese government allowed two WHO investigators into the country for three weeks to “lay the groundwork for an investigation into the source of the virus.” However, the two investigators were not permitted to visit Wuhan at any point in their stay.

Plagued probe

Earlier this month, the larger WHO team had planned to set out on a trip to Wuhan, only to have their plans cancelled at the last minute. The team’s trip was based on “arrangements jointly developed between WHO, the Chinese government, and countries for which the team was meant to travel through on their way to Wuhan,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a January 5 press briefing. But “today we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalized the necessary permissions for the team’s arrival in China. I am very disappointed with this news given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute.”

China is apparently wary of refreshing criticism and scrutiny of its early handling of the pandemic. However, its continual effort to hamper the investigation will likely only fuel the persistent suggestions that SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a Chinese lab. Though it’s difficult to entirely rule out the possibility, the evidence used to support the lab-escape ideas are circumstantial at best and wild speculation at worst.

Coronavirus experts have long and repeatedly argued that the far more likely cause of the pandemic was the virus jumping species into humans, as was seen with other outbreak-causing coronaviruses. In addition, independent researchers say there are no telltale signs of human tinkering in SARS-CoV-2’s genetic blueprints."
Australia to kill pigeon that crossed Pacific from Oregon,108,kxaa19,https://apnews.com/article/pacific-ocean-australia-birds-united-states-faae5a66c336c8b2dc902b1ed4270345,13,1610674201.0,,"FILE - In this Jan. 13, 2021, file image made from video, a pigeon with a blue leg band stands on a rooftop in Melbourne, Australia.

(Channel 9 via AP, File)

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A pigeon that Australia declared a biosecurity risk has received a reprieve after a U.S. bird organization declared its identifying leg band was fake.

The band suggested the bird found in a Melbourne backyard on Dec. 26 was a racing pigeon that had left the U.S. state of Oregon, 13,000 kilometers (8,000 miles) away, two months earlier.

On that basis, Australian authorities on Thursday said they considered the bird a disease risk and planned to kill it.

But Deone Roberts, sport development manager for the Oklahoma-based American Racing Pigeon Union, said on Friday the band was fake.

ADVERTISEMENT

The band number belongs to a blue bar pigeon in the United States which is not the bird pictured in Australia, she said.

“The bird band in Australia is counterfeit and not traceable,” Roberts said. “They do not need to kill him.”

Australia’s Agriculture Department, which is responsible for biosecurity, agreed that the pigeon dubbed Joe, after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, was wearing a “fraudulent copy” leg band.

“Following an investigation, the department has concluded that Joe the Pigeon is highly likely to be Australian and does not present a biosecurity risk,” it said in a statement.

The department said it will take no further action.

Acting Australian Prime Minister Michael McCormack had earlier said there would be no mercy if the pigeon was from the United States.

“If Joe has come in a way that has not met our strict biosecurity measures, then bad luck Joe, either fly home or face the consequences,” McCormack said.

Martin Foley, health minister for Victoria state where Joe is living, had called for the federal government to spare the bird even if it posed a disease risk.

“I would urge the Commonwealth’s quarantine officials to show a little bit of compassion,” Foley said.

Andy Meddick, a Victorian lawmaker for the minor Animal Justice Party, called for a “pigeon pardon for Joe.”

“Should the federal government allow Joe to live, I am happy to seek assurances that he is not a flight risk,” Meddick said.

Melbourne resident Kevin Celli-Bird, who found the emaciated bird in his backyard, was surprised by the change of nationality but pleased that the bird he named Joe would not be destroyed.

“I thought this is just a feel-good story and now you guys want to put this pigeon away and I thought it’s not on, you know, you can’t do that, there has got to be other options,” Celli-Bird said of the threat to euthanize.

Celli-Bird had contacted the American Racing Pigeon Union to find the bird’s owner based on the number on the leg band. The bands have both a number and a symbol, but Celli-Bird didn’t remember the symbol and said he can no longer catch the bird since it has recovered from its initial weakness.

The bird with the genuine leg band had disappeared from a 560-kilometer (350-mile) race in Oregon on Oct. 29, Crooked River Challenge owner Lucas Cramer said.

That bird did not have a racing record that would make it valuable enough to steal its identity, he said.

“That bird didn’t finish the race series, it didn’t make any money and so its worthless, really,” Cramer said.

He said it was possible a pigeon could cross the Pacific on a ship from Oregon to Australia.

“In reality, it could potentially happen, but this isn’t the same pigeon. It’s not even a racing pigeon,” Cramer said.

The bird spends every day in the backyard, sometimes with a native dove on a pergola.

“I might have to change him to Aussie Joe, but he’s just the same pigeon,” Celli-Bird said.

Lars Scott, a carer at Pigeon Rescue Melbourne, a bird welfare group, said pigeons with American leg bands were not uncommon around the city. A number of Melbourne breeders bought them online and used them for their own record keeping, Scott said.

Australian quarantine authorities are notoriously strict. In 2015, the government threatened to euthanize two Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, after they were smuggled into the country by Hollywood star Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard.

Faced with a 50-hour deadline to leave Australia, the dogs made it out in a chartered jet."
"Trump administration shelves planned investment ban on Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu: sources",33,kx6u6g,https://www.reuters.com/article/BigStory12/idUSKBN29I2RW,13,1610663937.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has scrapped plans to blacklist Chinese tech giants Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, four people familiar with the matter said, providing a brief reprieve to Beijing’s top corporates amid a broader crackdown by Washington.

Washington nonetheless plans to move forward this week with a bid to add as many as nine other Chinese companies to the list, one of the people said.

The decision to shelve plans to add the Chinese tech giants is a blow to China hawks in the administration, who have been seeking to cement outgoing President Donald Trump’s tough-on-China legacy before his presidency ends on Jan. 20.

E-commerce giant Alibaba, search engine giant Baidu and video game leader Tencent, which owns messaging app WeChat, were on the short list to be added to a catalogue of alleged Chinese military companies, which would have subjected them to a new U.S. investment ban.

But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, widely seen as taking a more dovish stance on China, pushed back, freezing the plans, the people said. The companies as well as the Treasury, State and Defense departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The abrupt decision throws into stark relief the deep divisions within the Trump administration on China policy, even as Trump seeks to lock President-elect Joe Biden into aggressive postures against the world’s second-largest economy.

Last month, the White House added China’s top chipmaker, SMIC, and oil giant CNOOC to the blacklist. Trump also unveiled an executive order in January banning U.S. transactions with eight Chinese apps including Ant Group’s Alipay. Both measures were first reported by Reuters.

While Trump touted a trade deal between the rival nations, relations between Washington and Beijing soured last year over China’s handling of the deadly coronavirus and its crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong.

But Greene in the interview cited an argument advanced by several Trump allies in the final months of his reelection campaign that while vice president, Biden threatened to withhold a loan to Ukraine if then-Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was not replaced.

Shokin at the time was investigating the founder of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas giant in Ukraine, of which Biden’s son Hunter Biden had served as a member of the board since 2014.

The U.S. threatened to withhold roughly $1 billion in loan guarantees if Shokin was not replaced as prosecutor general, a message Joe Biden delivered to officials in Kyiv while serving as vice president and recounted during a 2018 Council on Foreign Relations conference.

Taylor Greene shared a clip from the 2018 conference on Wednesday, writing “Quid Pro Joe, in his own words...” and “Americans will not tolerate this.”

While Biden did leverage aid in order to persuade Ukraine to oust Shokin in March 2016, it came amid larger criticism that Shokin was not pursuing allegations of corruption among the country’s politicians.

The former vice president has denied acting with his son's business interests in mind, and there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either of the Bidens. There is no evidence that Hunter Biden's work influenced U.S. policy.

In her Newsmax interview Wednesday, which aired hours after the House voted to impeach Trump for a second time, the Greene said she plans on filing the articles of impeachment to show Americans that “there are Republicans in Congress that are willing to stand up and fight for them.”

“I’m a big believer of having people in office who are actually willing to do the job, and I can’t imagine people in this country being so fearful of a future of a Biden presidency that they may be willing to commit violence like they did in the Capitol here in Washington, D.C. We cannot have that, I do not condone that violence,” the congresswoman said.

Trump was impeached in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress for pressuring Ukraine’s then-newly elected president to investigate the dealings of the Biden family in a phone call. He was acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate last February.

Last week’s deadly pro-Trump riot on the Capitol came after Trump urged his supporters at a rally earlier in the day to march toward Congress in opposition to lawmakers’ official Electoral College count of Biden’s 2020 presidential win, repeating his unsubstantiated claims that the election was “stolen.”

Greene’s pledge to move to impeach Biden came the same day the House voted in favor of an article of impeachment against Trump, which charged him with inciting the violent mob on the Capitol. Ten House Republicans sided with Democrats in the 232-197 vote."
Trump impeached for 'inciting' US Capitol riots - BBC News,451,kwqhl1,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55656385,90,1610602392.0,,"No US president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Mr Trump was impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings in Ukraine, but acquitted by the Senate. So was Bill Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868."
House Republicans say they won’t impeach Trump because of death threats,41,kwq24v,https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22229052/capitol-hill-riot-intimidate-legislators,14,1610601168.0,,"There is a disturbing reason Republicans in Congress are giving for refusing to break with President Donald Trump: They fear for their lives.

According to Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), this is a major reason why more House Republicans aren’t voting to impeach Donald Trump in the wake of the attack on the Capitol.

“The majority of them are paralyzed with fear,” Crow said in a Wednesday MSNBC appearance. “I had a lot of conversations with my Republican colleagues last night, and a couple of them broke down in tears — saying that they are afraid for their lives if they vote for this impeachment.”

Tim Alberta, Politico’s chief political correspondent, found in his own reporting that “Crow was right.”

“I know for a fact several members *want* to impeach but fear casting that vote could get them or their families murdered,” Alberta writes. “Numerous House Republicans have received death threats in the past week.”

This fear has not only affected the impeachment vote. Rep. Pete Meijer (R-MI) has said that he personally knows several House Republicans who wanted to vote to certify Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral win but were afraid for their lives if they chose to do so.

“I had colleagues who, when it came time to recognize reality and vote to certify Arizona and Pennsylvania in the Electoral College, they knew in their heart of hearts that they should’ve voted to certify, but some had legitimate concerns about the safety of their families,” Meijer told Reason magazine’s Matt Welch. “They felt that that vote would put their families in danger.”

The comments from Crow, Alberta, and Meijer illustrate a devastating truth: The Capitol Hill attack was, in large part, a success.

The violent seizure of the Capitol demonstrated to legislators that crossing Donald Trump puts them in the literal crosshairs. This was explicitly part of the point for some: In online comments cited in an FBI document on the violent threats before the attack, one person wrote that “Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in.”

“We get our President or we die,” they added. “NOTHING else will achieve this goal.”

Convincing Congress to install Trump for another presidential term was always an unattainable goal. But influencing legislators to vote differently in the future, in ways more congenial to the Trumpist movement, was not.

In weak and young democracies, especially ones with recent experience of civil war, you often see a phenomenon called “electoral violence,” in which armed groups use intimidation and force to coerce voters into supporting their preferred political parties.

In the United States, it seems like we’re seeing the emergence of something more properly termed “legislative violence.” Far-right demonstrators in both DC and state capitals are using both threats and actual violence to coerce members of their own broad political faction, the Republican Party, to toe their line. In a country where firearms are omnipresent and easily attainable by legal means, legislators have good reason to take such threats seriously.

Of course, both electoral and legislative violence are antithetical to democracy. They replicate the political conditions of an authoritarian state, where the fear of physical violence prevents citizens and government officials from having an authentic voice in their government. It is the antithesis of the democratic ideal of self-government, its replacement with the rule of the most ruthless and brutal.

It is alarming that this is happening in the United States today. And there are very good reasons to believe that the success of these tactics — that the rioters successfully took the Capitol and scared elected officials — will lead to them being tried again.

A recent Politico article describes an unnamed GOP House member flying home after the Capitol attack, expecting support after their ordeal from constituents. Instead, he recalls being greeted by a striking refrain from his supporters.

“Do you think that Congress got the message?”"
Exclusive: Facebook tracking a rise in violent rhetoric tied to U.S. presidential inauguration,29,kwp2w4,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook-extremists-excl/exclusive-facebook-tracking-a-rise-in-violent-rhetoric-tied-to-u-s-presidential-inauguration-idUSKBN29I28L,5,1610598395.0,,"PALO ALTO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has seen an increase in signals indicating potential future acts of violence associated with efforts to contest the result of the U.S. presidential election since the Capitol siege last week, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.

The spokeswoman, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said late Tuesday the storming of the U.S. Capitol by armed pro-Trump demonstrators appeared to be a galvanizing event, spawning efforts to organize gatherings across the country for multiple dates around President-elect Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.

Signals Facebook tracked included digital flyers promoting the events, some of them featuring calls to arms or the insignia of militias or hate groups, she said.

The FBI has warned of armed protests being planned for Washington and all 50 U.S. state capitals in the run-up to the inauguration. The Facebook spokeswoman said the pace of the company’s exchange of information with law enforcement officials had likewise increased since the Capitol protests.

The FBI and Biden’s inauguration team did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Facebook report.

Violent rhetoric on online platforms had already ramped up in the weeks before last week’s unrest as right-wing groups planned the assault, largely in open public view, according to researchers and public postings.

Lawmakers were forced to flee as the Capitol was mobbed by Trump loyalists, white nationalist groups and militias who overwhelmed security forces. Five people died in the violence, including a Capitol Police officer who was beaten as he tried to ward off the crowds.

After the unrest, tech companies took unprecedented steps to crack down on the baseless claims of election fraud that had spurred calls for violence. Twitter Inc and Facebook blocked Trump’s accounts, while Amazon Web Services and the major mobile app stores cut off social media network Parler.

On Monday, Facebook banned content promoting the phrase “stop the steal,” which has become a rallying cry at armed pro-Trump protests. The company was also blocking searches for “storm the Capitol” and flagging posts that include those phrases for further review, the spokeswoman said.

Under pressure from civil rights groups, Alphabet Inc’s YouTube suspended Trump’s channel for seven days."
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf resigns,4,kwb6f9,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/11/politics/chad-wolf-homeland-security/index.html,5,1610549692.0,,"(CNN) Chad Wolf is resigning as the acting secretary of Homeland Security, he said in a letter to the department Monday obtained by CNN.

Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor will be the new acting secretary, taking over in the wake of the US Capitol attack and as the national security apparatus prepares for possible violence leading up to Inauguration Day.

""I am saddened to take this step, as it was my intention to serve the Department until the end of this Administration,"" Wolf wrote, citing ongoing litigation challenging the validity of his appointment.

""Unfortunately, this action is warranted by recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as Acting Secretary. These events and concerns increasingly serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power,"" Wolf added.

Wolf was in the chief role at the department in an acting capacity for 14 months. His tenure has repeatedly come up in litigation against the Trump administration's immigration actions, most recently last week regarding asylum limits.

Wolf is the latest Cabinet secretary to resign in recent days, though his letter did not cite last week's riots. Betsy DeVos, who served as education secretary, and Elaine Chao, who was transportation secretary, have also resigned.

House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson called the timing of Wolf's resignation ""questionable,"" citing the concerns about the legality of his appointment.

""He has chosen to resign during a time of national crisis and when domestic terrorists may be planning additional attacks on our government. Unlike others, he is apparently not leaving the Trump Administration on principle,"" the Mississippi Democrat said, adding that Wolf's number two, Ken Cuccinelli, should also resign over questions about his authority.

Heading into a week with the FBI warning of warning of possible armed protests at all 50 state capitols and at the US Capitol, almost all the key national security agencies are being run by acting leaders, including the Department of Justice and Department of Defense. DHS will now have a new chief with only nine days until Inauguration Day.

Before announcing he was stepping down Monday, Wolf said he had instructed the US Secret Service to begin National Special Security Event operations for the inauguration on Wednesday instead of January 19, citing in part ""events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration.""

Last week, Wolf urged President Donald Trump and all elected officials to condemn the violence on Capitol Hill in a sharply worded statement, while vowing to stay in his position until President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

""What transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening. While I have consistently condemned political violence on both sides of the aisle, specifically violence directed at law enforcement, we now see some supporters of the President using violence as a means to achieve political ends,"" Wolf said. ""This is unacceptable.""

Legal concerns about Wolf as acting secretary

On Thursday, it was revealed that the White House had withdrawn Wolf's official nomination to the secretary post, sparking concerns among DHS officials about whether Wolf could legally stay, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

Last Friday, DHS legal counsel spoke to the Office of Legal Counsel about the withdrawal and the legal implications for the secretary role, according to another source.

Wolf's legitimacy has been a struggle for the department and has threatened to derail policies and other actions put in place during his tenure.

Former DHS General Counsel John Mitnick, who served in the Trump administration, wrote that the withdrawal of Wolf's nomination ""raises the issue of whether he ""can continue to perform the functions of the Secretary.""

Wolf has been serving as chief of the Department of Homeland Security -- the third largest federal department -- since November 2019 after the resignation of his predecessor, Kevin McAleenan.

In late August, weeks into the unrest in Portland, Oregon, Trump announced his intention to nominate Wolf to serve as Homeland Security secretary -- a surprising maneuver given Trump's preference to have Cabinet officials serve as acting because, he says, it gives him ""more flexibility."" DHS has not had a Senate-confirmed secretary since April 2019.

The nomination came on the heels of a Government Accountability Office report that found the appointments of Wolf and his deputy Cuccinelli were invalid.

While the Senate Homeland Security Committee cleared the way for a Senate confirmation vote in the fall, it did not come for a floor vote, leaving Wolf to continue serving in an acting capacity.

His tenure has repeatedly come up in litigation against the administration's immigration actions. Wolf's appointment was notably cited in a challenge against new rules limiting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

In November, a federal judge found Wolf had not been legally serving as acting Homeland Security secretary when he signed rules limiting applications and renewals for DACA, which shields undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation, and said those rules are now invalid. The program -- which Trump pledged to terminate -- was later restored.

In a previous attempt to self-correct the succession order, DHS had Gaynor, who is the Senate-confirmed FEMA administrator, temporarily exercise the authority of Homeland Security secretary to try to alleviate concerns over Wolf's legitimacy as acting chief of the department. Under one interpretation, Gaynor would be the lawfully serving acting secretary based on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

According to his FEMA bio , Gaynor, who was confirmed last January, has more than 11 years of experience in emergency management. Under his tenure, the agency juggled natural disasters as well as response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Gaynor told his workforce he will assume the role of acting Homeland Security secretary until January 20, when Biden is inaugurated, according to a message obtained by CNN.

FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton will serve as the senior official performing the duties of the FEMA administrator, Gaynor said, until the next administrator is confirmed.

The moves by Trump's banks are the clearest signs yet of looming financial blowback to his business empire as he leaves office facing widespread repudiation for stoking the Jan. 6 mob attack that disrupted Biden's election certification. A growing number of major financial institutions and other corporations have spoken out against the events and announced plans to cut off financial support for Republican officials.

Deutsche Bank's break with Trump follows years of intense public scrutiny and litigation triggered by its association with the president. After winning control of the House majority in 2018, Democrats launched an investigation into the bank's dealings with Trump, issuing subpoenas that sparked a legal battle all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment on its relationship with Trump. The New York Times earlier reported the bank's decision to stop doing business with the president.

"McConnell is said to be pleased about impeachment, believing it will be easier to purge Trump from the G.O.P.",28,kw4vyl,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/us/mitch-mcconnell-trump-impeachment.html,28,1610527035.0,,"[Watch live impeachment vote analysis.]

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has told associates that he believes President Trump committed impeachable offenses and that he is pleased that Democrats are moving to impeach him, believing that it will make it easier to purge him from the party, according to people familiar with his thinking. The House is voting on Wednesday to formally charge Mr. Trump with inciting violence against the country.

At the same time, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader and one of Mr. Trump’s most steadfast allies in Congress, has asked other Republicans whether he should call on Mr. Trump to resign in the aftermath of the riot at the Capitol last week, according to three Republican officials briefed on the conversations.

While Mr. McCarthy has said he is personally opposed to impeachment, he and other party leaders have decided not to formally lobby Republicans to vote “no,” and an aide to Mr. McCarthy said he was open to a measure censuring Mr. Trump for his conduct. In private, Mr. McCarthy reached out to a leading House Democrat to see if the chamber would be willing to pursue a censure vote, though Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ruled it out.

Taken together, the stances of Congress’s two top Republicans — neither of whom has said publicly that Mr. Trump should resign or be impeached — reflected the politically challenging and fast-moving nature of the crisis that the party faces after the assault by a pro-Trump mob during a session to formalize President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s electoral victory."
"'No limit' - the more exercise the better, heart health study finds",27,kw17gy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-fitness/no-limit-the-more-exercise-the-better-heart-health-study-finds-idUSKBN29H2NN,6,1610515801.0,,"LONDON (Reuters) - When it comes to matters of heart health, no amount of exercise is too much, scientists said on Tuesday in research that debunks the myth that high levels of vigorous physical activity might not always be beneficial.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

The research found “every move counts” towards improving cardiovascular health, the scientists said, with the lowest risk for heart disease seen in people who exercised the most.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading world’s number one cause of death - killing almost 18 million people a year globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

This research, which involved more than 90,000 people studied over a five-year period, found that those in the top 25% of people who engaged in vigorous-intensity activity had an average reduction in risk heart disease of between 54% and 63%.

For those in the top quarter of all types of exercise - covering activity from moderate to vigorous - the average heart disease risk reduction was between 48% to 57%.

“This debunks the myth that there is a peak beyond which you should not do more exercise,” said Rema Ramakrishnan, a biostatistician and epidemiologist at Oxford University who co-led the study. “There is no limit to what you can do in terms of physical activity (to improve heart health).”

Aiden Doherty, an Oxford professor who worked with Ramakrishnan, said the study’s results were a robust endorsement for WHO advice that people should aim to do at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise a week.

“This is the largest ever study of device-measured physical activity and cardiovascular disease,” he said. It shows that “physical activity is probably even more important ... than we previously thought.”

The study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, used wrist-worn activity tracking devices known as accelerometers to accurately record the activity of more than 90,000 participants.

The researchers said the results were similar for men and women, although the benefits of vigorous exercise appeared to be particularly strong for women.

And while people who exercised more were also more likely to not smoke, to have a healthy weight and a moderate alcohol intake, the researchers said they adjusted for these factors and still found a strong link between higher levels of exercise and lower rates heart disease."
Trump warns impeachment for Capitol riot is 'tremendous danger' to U.S.,459,kvzded,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/trump-warns-impeachment-is-a-danger-to-us-in-first-public-comments-since-riot.html,125,1610510430.0,,"""It's ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous,"" Trump said in his first comments to the media since the riot, which killed a Capitol police officer and left at least four other people dead.

In his comments before departing for Texas on Tuesday, Trump again used the type of language that critics say fueled the mob, calling the planned impeachment by the Democratic-led House ""really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in politics.""

""People thought what I said was totally appropriate,"" Trump told reporters when he was asked what his personal responsibility was for the violence.

Trump also claimed that his inflammatory comments at a rally shortly before the invasion of the halls of Congress by thousands of his supporters on Wednesday were not harmful.

President Donald Trump doubled down Tuesday on the incendiary rhetoric that incited the Capitol riot, warning darkly that it was dangerous to the United States for him to be impeached for his conduct.

""This impeachment is causing tremendous anger, and you're doing it, and it's really a terrible thing that they're doing,"" Trump said, apparently blaming reporters for his looming impeachment.

""For [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi and [Senate Democratic leader] Chuck Schumer to continue on this path, I think it's causing tremendous danger to our country, and it's causing tremendous anger,"" he said.

The president then added, ""I want no violence.""

""As far as this is concerned, we want no violence, we want absolutely no violence,"" Trump said.

But he did not explicitly condemn the actions by the mob of his supporters at the Capitol, who were motivated to protest against and prevent congressional confirmation of Biden's election as the next president.

Schumer later said, ""Donald Trump should not hold office one day longer, and what we saw in his statement today is proof positive of that.""

Trump, who has been banned from a slew of social media platforms since last week because of his comments, also said in his comments: ""I think Big Tech has made a terrible mistake.""

In an apparent reference to his ban on Twitter and elsewhere, Trump said it is ""very, very bad for our country and that's leading others to do the same thing.""

""And it causes a lot of problems and a lot of danger. Big mistake. They shouldn't be doing it,"" the president said.

""But there's always a counter move when they do that. I've never seen such anger as I see right now, and that's a terrible thing.""

Asked whether he would resign before the end of his term next week, Trump did not answer.

Trump addressed his supporters' invasion of the Capitol later Tuesday, at the start of a speech in Alamo, Texas, on the U.S.-Mexico border. Again, he did not take any responsibility for inciting the crowd, and he did not outright condemn the violence.

""Millions of our citizens watched on Wednesday as a mob stormed the Capitol and trashed the halls of government. As I have consistently said throughout my administration, we believe in respecting America's history and traditions, not tearing them down. We believe in the rule of law, not violence or rioting,"" Trump said.

""Now is the time for our nation to heal, and it's time for peace, for calm,"" he added in the speech. ""Respect for law enforcement, and the great people within law enforcement — so many are here — is the foundation of the MAGA agenda. And we're a nation of law, and we're a nation of order.""

Trump's looming impeachment, like his first one, directly stems from his actions seeking to prevent Biden from becoming president.

House Democrats first impeached Trump in late 2019 for pressuring the president of Ukraine that summer to announce that country was investigating Biden and his son Hunter over purported misconduct. While leaning on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine, which was battling pro-Russian forces, even though the aid was already approved by Congress.

On Wednesday, the riot interrupted a joint session of Congress confirming Biden's election victory. His win was later confirmed early Thursday in a proceeding overseen by Vice President Mike Pence.

Three members of Trump's Cabinet have resigned in the wake of last Wednesday's riot: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and Chad Wolf, who had been acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

The District of Columbia's attorney general said Monday that he will investigate whether to criminally charge Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., for inciting the riot with their statements at the White House rally just before Trump's supporters invaded the Capitol.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., reportedly told GOP caucus members on the same day that Trump bore some responsibility for the riot."
Roots Of U.S. Capitol Insurrectionists Run Through American West,72,kvy4s4,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/12/955665162/roots-of-u-s-capitol-insurrectionists-run-through-american-west,9,1610506877.0,,"Roots Of U.S. Capitol Insurrectionists Run Through American West

As the violent mob broke into the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday, and livestreams showed pro-Trump insurrectionists defacing property and posing in the House Speaker's chair, here in the West, feelings of shock quickly faded to familiarity.

""There are years of warning signs,"" said Eric Ward of the Western States Center, which tracks extremism in Oregon and the West.

It was five years ago this month when anti-government militants led an armed siege of a federal wildlife refuge in rural eastern Oregon. Far-right extremists led by Ammon Bundy occupied government buildings, vandalized and defaced property and at one point bulldozed a road across land considered sacred to local Native Americans.

""We will go out of this state and out of this country as free men,"" proclaimed Bundy to reporters in January of 2016, referring to an attempt to seize control more broadly of US public lands.

Bundy did eventually leave Oregon free, a jury acquitted him late in 2016. Late last month, he posted a video urging his followers to go to Washington on Jan. 6.

""God bless you, drive safe, fly safe, don't wear a mask and stand for freedom,"" Bundy said.

Extremist group monitors say violent acts like the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol have been incubating in the western U.S. for years. Self-identified ""patriots"" have stormed government buildings, vandalized property and frequently threatened public employees often with few, if any legal consequences.

A western ""ethos""

The freed Bundy has been a far right fixture in the response to the pandemic in the West, leading protests portraying public health restrictions like mask rules as tyranny.

In August, he violently forced his way into the Idaho Capitol, disrupting legislative hearings. His ""People's Rights"" group followers frequently target the homes of local officials. In December, then-Ada County, Idaho Commissioner Diana Lachiando had to race home from a public health meeting upon learning that protesters were banging on her door where her son was alone. Boise's mayor and police chief canceled the meeting citing safety reasons.

Last week, Lachiando said she'd seen some of the same protesters who were outside her home in social media feeds from inside the U.S. Capitol. She called their notion of freedom as divorced from responsibility.

""Now we see that nationally, people have adopted this sort of ethos, whether they are aligning with the Proud Boys or the Three Percent [militia],"" Lachiando says.

Eric Ward at the Western States Center said the Trump loyalists last week were emboldened after watching recent western uprisings.

""What we're seeing now is the anticipated outcome of allowing these groups to practice their insurrection on the streets and rural roads of the western region,"" Ward says, noting that many of the scofflaws are now free.

President Trump pardoned the Oregon ranchers who were in prison on arson charges and whose fight with federal land managers inspired the standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. He also just pardoned a Utah legislator convicted on federal charges for leading an off-road vehicle ride through sensitive public land.

""Go get the job done""

And then there's Cliven Bundy, Ammon's father, who led an armed standoff near the family's Nevada ranch in 2014. He walked out of the federal courthouse in Las Vegas a free man after the federal government's case against him collapsed in January 2018.

""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters at the time.

He continues to graze his cattle on federal land without paying or following any federal environmental laws. After the Capitol insurrection, the rancher posted heaping praise for President Trump on Facebook, who Bundy said pointed his loyalists towards Congress, ""and nodded his head to go get the job done.""

""It is a movement that feels that it has received permission to act out its fantasies of political violence,"" Ward says.

The movement also enjoys support from some elected Republican leaders in the region. After his return from Washington, D.C., last week, Couy Griffin, a defiant Otero County, New Mexico commissioner, posted a video on Facebook boasting about a future far-right rally in Washington.

""We could have a Second Amendment rally on those same steps, you know, and if we do, it's gonna be a sad day because there's going to be blood running out of that building,"" Griffin says.

The video has since been taken down. But in others still on the site, Griffin, who founded the group ""Cowboys for Trump,"" rails against Democratic Party leaders and promises activists will reconvene in D.C. ahead of the inauguration.

""A Joe Biden presidency is something that we can never allow,"" he says in one video.

Sagebrush rebels

These aren't just the sagebrush rebels in cowboy hats as they're so often cast.

The recent western uprisings drew people from cities around the nation: from Alex Jones and his conspiracy theorists to anti-Islamic campaigners to white nationalists.

Back in Boise, Diana Lachiando is worried about far-right extremism further reaching into the mainstream. She lost her bid for reelection to the Ada County Commission in Idaho last fall. Friday was her last day in office.

""I don't have a lot of patience for the people who all of the sudden, it was a step too far to see some people take over the [U.S.] Capitol,"" Lachiando says. ""There are politicians who have been coddling those sentiments for years.""

Westerners such as Lachiando drew another parallel as they watched the Capitol insurrectionists post their illegal entry and vandalizing right to their own social media feeds. The Bundys and their followers largely did the same back in 2016.

WASHINGTON (AP) — They came from across America, summoned by President Donald Trump to march on Washington in support of his false claim that the November election was stolen and to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden as the victor.

“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted a week before Christmas. “Be there, will be wild!”

The insurrectionist mob that showed up at the president’s behest and stormed the U.S. Capitol was overwhelmingly made up of longtime Trump supporters, including Republican Party officials, GOP political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, members of the military and adherents of the QAnon myth that the government is secretly controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophile cannibals. Records show that some were heavily armed and included convicted criminals, such as a Florida man recently released from prison for attempted murder.

The Associated Press reviewed social media posts, voter registrations, court files and other public records for more than 120 people either facing criminal charges related to the Jan. 6 unrest or who, going maskless amid the pandemic, were later identified through photographs and videos taken during the melee.

The evidence gives lie to claims by right-wing pundits and Republican officials such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., that the violence was perpetrated by left-wing antifa thugs rather than supporters of the president.

“If the reports are true,” Gaetz said on the House floor just hours after the attack, “some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters. They were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa.”

Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, told reporters that investigators had seen “no indication” antifa activists were disguised as Trump supporters in Wednesday’s riot.

The AP found that many of the rioters had taken to social media after the November election to retweet and parrot false claims by Trump that the vote had been stolen in a vast international conspiracy. Several had openly threatened violence against Democrats and Republicans they considered insufficiently loyal to the president. During the riot, some livestreamed and posted photos of themselves at the Capitol. Afterwards, many bragged about what they had done.

As the mob smashed through doors and windows to invade the Capitol, a loud chant went up calling for the hanging of Vice President Mike Pence, the recent target of a Trump Twitter tirade for not subverting the Constitution and overturning the legitimate vote tally. Outside, a wooden scaffold had been erected on the National Mall, a rope noose dangling at the ready.

So far, at least 90 people have been arrested on charges ranging from misdemeanor curfew violations to felonies related to assaults on police officers, possessing illegal weapons and making death threats against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Among them was Lonnie Leroy Coffman, 70, an Alabama grandfather who drove to Washington to attend Trump’s “Save America Rally” in a red GMC Sierra pickup packed with an M4 assault rifle, multiple loaded magazines, three handguns and 11 Mason jars filled with homemade napalm, according to court filings.

The truck was found during a security sweep involving explosives-sniffing dogs after two pipe bombs were found and disarmed Wednesday near the national headquarters of the Republican and Democratic parties. Coffman was arrested that evening when he returned to the truck carrying a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun and a .22-caliber derringer pistol in his pockets. Federal officials said Coffman is not suspected of planting the pipe bombs, though he was charged with having Molotov cocktails in the bed of his truck.

His grandson, Brandon Coffman, told the AP on Friday his grandfather was a Republican who had expressed admiration for Trump at holiday gatherings. He said he had no idea why Coffman would show up in the nation’s capital armed for civil war.

Also facing federal charges is Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr., a Georgia man who in the wake of the election had protested outside the home of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump had publicly blamed for his loss in the state. Meredith drove to Washington last week for the “Save America” rally but arrived late because of a problem with the lights on his trailer, according to court filings that include expletive-laden texts.

Full Coverage: Capitol Siege

“Headed to DC with a (s—-) ton of 5.56 armor-piercing ammo,” he texted friends and relatives on Jan. 6, adding a purple devil emoji, according to court filings. The following day, he texted to the group: “Thinking about heading over to Pelosi (C——’s) speech and putting a bullet in her noggin on Live TV.” He once again added a purple devil emoji, and wrote he might hit her with his truck instead. “I’m gonna run that (C—-) Pelosi over while she chews on her gums. … Dead (B——) Walking. I predict that within 12 days, many in our country will die.”

Meredith, who is white, then texted a photo of himself in blackface. “I’m gonna walk around DC FKG with people by yelling ‘Allahu ak Bar’ randomly.”

A participant in the text exchange provided screenshots to the FBI, who tracked Meredith to a Holiday Inn a short walk from the Capitol. They found a compact Tavor X95 assault rifle, a 9mm Glock 19 handgun and about 100 rounds of ammunition, according to court filings. The agents also seized a stash of THC edibles and a vial of injectable testosterone.

Meredith is charged with transmitting a threat, as well as felony counts for possession of firearms and ammunition.

Michael Thomas Curzio was arrested in relation to the riots less than two years after he was released from a Florida prison in 2019 after serving an eight-year sentence for attempted murder. Court records from Florida show that he shot the boyfriend of his former girlfriend in a fight at her home.

Federal law enforcement officials vowed Friday to bring additional charges against those who carried out the attack on the Capitol, launching a nationwide manhunt for dozens of suspects identified from photographic evidence

The FBI has opened a murder probe into the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick , who was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation publicly. He died at a hospital.

The Trump supporters who died in the riot were Kevin D. Greeson , 55, of Athens, Alabama; Benjamin Philips, 50, of Ringtown, Pennsylvania; Ashli Babbitt , 35, of San Diego; and Rosanne Boyland , 34, of Kennesaw, Georgia.

Boyland’s sister told the AP on Friday she was an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory that holds Trump is America’s savior. Her Facebook page featured photos and videos praising Trump and promoting fantasies, including one theory that a shadowy group was using the coronavirus to steal elections. Boyland’s final post on Twitter — a retweet of a post by White House social media director Dan Scavino — was a picture of thousands of people surrounding the Washington Monument on Wednesday.

“She would text me some things, and I would be like, ‘Let me fact-check that.’ And I’d sit there and I’d be like, ‘Well, I don’t think that’s actually right,’” Lonna Cave, Boyland’s sister, said. “We got in fights about it, arguments.”

The AP’s review found that QAnon beliefs were common among those who heeded Trump’s call to come to Washington.

Doug Jensen, 41, was arrested by the FBI on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, after returning home from the riot. An AP photographer captured images of him confronting Capitol Police officers outside of the Senate chamber on Wednesday.

Jensen was wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with a large Q and the phrase “Trust The Plan,” a reference to QAnon. Video posted online during the storming of the Capitol also appears to show Jensen, who is white, pursuing a Black police officer up an interior flight of stairs as a mob of people trails several steps behind. At several points, the officer says “get back,” but to no avail.

Jensen’s older brother, William Routh, told the AP on Saturday that Jensen believed that the person posting as Q was either Trump or someone very close to the president.

“I feel like he had a lot of influence from the internet that confused or obscured his views on certain things,” said Routh, of Clarksville, Arkansas, who described himself as a Republican Trump supporter. “When I talked to him, he thought that maybe this was Trump telling him what to do.”

Jensen’s employer, Forrest & Associate Masonry in Des Moines, announced Friday that he had been fired.

Tara Coleman, a 40-year-old mother who lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was arrested at the Capitol for a curfew violation and for unlawful entry. On her Facebook page, Coleman re-posted articles supporting the QAnon beliefs about a “deep state” conspiracy to target children. The AP could not find a working phone number for Coleman and her attorney, Peter Cooper, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

And Jake Chansley, who calls himself the “QAnon Shaman” and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, surrendered to the FBI field office in Phoenix on Saturday. News photos show him at the riot shirtless, with his face painted and wearing a fur hat with horns, carrying a U.S. flag attached to a wooden pole topped with a spear.

Chansley’s unusual headwear is visible in a Nov. 7 AP photo at a rally of Trump supporters protesting election results outside of the Maricopa County election center in Phoenix. In that photo, Chansley, who also has gone by the last name Angeli, held a sign that read, “HOLD THE LINE PATRIOTS GOD WINS.” He also expressed his support for the president in an interview with the AP that day.

The FBI identified Chansley by his distinctive tattoos, which include bricks circling his biceps in an apparent reference to Trump’s border wall. Chansley didn’t respond last week to messages seeking comment to one of his social media accounts.

There were also current and former members of the U.S. military in the crowd.

Army commanders at Fort Bragg in North Carolina are investigating Capt. Emily Rainey’s involvement in the Wednesday rally. The 30-year-old psychological operations officer told the AP she led 100 members of Moore County Citizens for Freedom who traveled to Washington to “stand against election fraud” and support Trump. She insisted she acted within Army regulations and that no one in her group entered the Capitol or broke the law.

“I was a private citizen and doing everything right and within my rights,” Rainey told the AP.

Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Larry Rendall Brock Jr. of Texas was charged in federal court on Sunday after he was identified in photos showing him standing in the well of the Senate, wearing a military-style helmet and body armor while holding a pair of zip-tie handcuffs.

The insurrectionist mob also included members of the neofascist group known as the Proud Boys, whom Trump urged to “stand back and stand by” when asked to condemn them by a moderator during a presidential debate in September.

Nicholas R. Ochs, 34, was arrested Saturday after returning home to Hawaii, where he is the founder of the local Proud Boys chapter. On Wednesday, Ochs posted a photo of himself on Twitter inside the Capitol, grinning broadly and smoking a cigarette. According to court filings, the FBI matched photos of Ochs taken during the riot to photos taken when Ochs campaigned unsuccessfully last year as the Republican nominee for a seat in the Hawaii statehouse.

Proud Boys leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio was arrested Monday in Washington on weapons charges and ordered to stay out of the nation’s capital. Tarrio is accused of vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church last month.

Jay Robert Thaxton, 46, was arrested near the Capitol for curfew violations on Wednesday. A North Carolina man with the same name has also been linked to the Proud Boys. He told The Stanly News & Press in 2019 that he was a Proud Boys supporter but wouldn’t say if he was an official member of the group. Another North Carolina newspaper, The Jacksonville Daily News, published a photo of Thaxton wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat at a 2019 protest over the removal of Confederate statues.

A man who answered a telephone number associated with Thaxton hung up on an AP reporter. The recipient of a text message to the same number responded with an expletive.

Also arrested at the Capitol was William Arthur Leary, who owns a manufactured housing business in Utica, New York. In an interview Friday, Leary told the AP that he strongly believes the election was stolen from Trump and that he went to Washington to show his support.

Leary said he doesn’t trust information reported by the mainstream media and that one of his main sources of information was Infowars, the far-right conspiracy site run by Alex Jones. He denied he ever set foot in the Capitol and complained that he was held for more than 24 hours and had his cell phone seized.

“They treated us like animals,” he complained. “They took all our phones. I didn’t get to make a phone call to tell anybody where I was.”

Leary said he remembers seeing a woman, Kristina Malimon, 28, sobbing at the detention center because she had been separated and not allowed to translate for her mother, who primarily speaks Russian. Both women had been charged with curfew violation and unlawful entry. According to a video posted on her Instagram account, the younger Malimon says she was born in Moldova, where her family had faced persecution under the Soviet-era regime for their Christian beliefs.

Malimon, who traveled to D.C. from Portland, Oregon, is vice chairwoman of the Young Republicans of Oregon, according to the group’s website and is also listed as an “ambassador” for the pro-Trump group Turning Point USA. Her social media feeds are full of photos taken at Trump events, including the earlier “Million MAGA March” held in Washington last month. She also posted photos of herself posing with Donald Trump Jr. and Roger Stone, who was convicted of crimes including obstruction of justice and pardoned by Trump on Christmas Eve.

Media reports from Oregon quoted Malimon in August as the primary organizer of a Trump boat parade on the Willamette River, where big waves created by speeding boats flying Trump flags swamped and sank a smaller boat that was not participating, throwing a family into the water to be rescued by the sheriff’s department.

“Oregon, today you came out and showed your love and support for our wonderful President, Donald J. Trump thank you!” Kristina Malimon wrote on Facebook following the parade.

Malimon also served as a Republican poll watcher in Georgia and spoke at an event organized by the Trump campaign in December, claiming to have seen voting machines and tabulation computers in Savannah, Georgia, with suspiciously blinking green lights she interpreted as a sign they were being secretly controlled by outside hackers — a claim debunked as false by GOP election officials in the state.

A phone number listed for Kristina Malimon rang without being answered on Friday. At the address listed for her in southeast Portland on Friday night, her teenage brother answered the door as other family members, including young children, ran around.

The family spoke Russian to each other and the brother, Nick Malimon, translated. He said his sister was still in Washington but had called the family following her release from jail and didn’t seem upset about her arrest.

Others are facing consequences even beyond arrest.

A Texas sheriff announced Thursday that he had reported one of his lieutenants to the FBI after she posted photos of herself on social media with a crowd outside the Capitol. Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said Lt. Roxanne Mathai, a 46-year-old jailer, had the right to attend the rally but he’s investigating whether she may have broken the law.

One of the posts Mathai shared was a photo that appeared to be taken Wednesday from among the mass of Trump supporters outside the Capitol, “Not gonna lie......aside from my kids, this was, indeed, the best day of my life. And it’s not over yet.”

A lawyer for Mathai, a mother and longtime San Antonio resident, said she attended the Trump rally but never entered the Capitol.

Attorney Hector Cortes said Mathai’s contract bars her from speaking directly with the press but that she welcomes an FBI investigation and that her actions were squarely within the bounds of the First Amendment.

Brad Rukstales, a Republican political donor and CEO of Cogensia, a Chicago-based data analytics firm, was arrested with a group of a half-dozen Trump supporters who clashed with officers Wednesday inside the Capitol. Campaign finance reports show Rukstales contributed more than $25,000 to Trump’s campaign and other GOP committees during to 2020 election cycle.

He told a local CBS news channel last week that he had entered the Capitol and apologized. He was fired Friday and did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.

Derrick Evans, a Republican recently sworn in as a delegate to the West Virginia House, resigned Saturday following his arrest on two charges related to the Capitol riot. He had streamed video of himself charging into the building with the mob.

“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans, 35, says in the video, as the door to the Capitol building is smashed and rioters rush through. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!”

On Saturday he issued a statement saying he regretted taking part.

“I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians,” the statement said.

"Every Deleted Parler Post, Many With Users' Location Data, Has Been Archived",9,kvdrdv,https://gizmodo.com/every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-users-location-dat-1846032466,2,1610432710.0,,"The Parler App popular with right-wing supporters has been suspended by Amazon store over continued postings by users that incite violence. Photo : Hollie Adams ( Getty Images )

In the wake of the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by scores of President Trump’s supporters, a lone researcher began an effort to catalogue the posts of social media users across Parler, a platform founded to provide conservative users a safe haven for uninhibited “free speech” — but which ultimately devolved into a hotbed of far-right conspiracy theories, unchecked racism, and death threats aimed at prominent politicians.



The researcher, who asked to be referred to by her Twitter handle, @donk_enby, began with the goal of archiving every post from January 6, the day of the Capitol riot; what she called a bevy of “very incriminating” evidence. According to the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, among other sources, Parler is one of a several apps used by the insurrections to coordinate their breach of the Capitol, in a plan to overturn the 2020 election results and keep Donald Trump in power.

Five people died in the attempt.

Hoping to create a lasting public record for future researchers to sift through, @donk_enby began by archiving the posts from that day. The scope of the project quickly broadened, however, as it became increasingly clear that Parler was on borrowed time. Apple and Google announced that Parler would be removed from their app stores because it had failed to properly moderate posts that encouraged violence and crime. The final nail in the coffin came Saturday when Amazon announced it was pulling Parler’s plug.

In an email first obtained by BuzzFeed News, Amazon officials told the company they planned to boot it from its clouding hosting service, Amazon Web Services, saying it had witnessed a “steady increase” in violent content across the platform. “It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service,” the email read.

Operating on little sleep, @donk_enby began the work of archiving all of Parler’s posts, ultimately capturing around 99.9 percent of its content. In a tweet early Sunday, @donk_enby said she was crawling some 1.1 million Parler video URLs. “These are the original, unprocessed, raw files as uploaded to Parler with all associated metadata,” she said. Included in this data tranche, now more than 56 terabytes in size, @donk_enby confirmed that the raw video files include GPS metadata pointing to exact locations of where the videos were taken.

@donk_enby later shared a screenshot showing the GPS position of a particular video, with coordinates in latitude and longitude.

The privacy implications are obvious, but the copious data may also serve as a fertile hunting ground for law enforcement. Federal and local authorities have arrested dozens of suspects in recent days accused of taking part in the Capitol riot, where a Capitol police officer, Brian Sicknick, was fatally wounded after being struck in the head with a fire extinguisher.

@donk_enby describes herself as hacker, in the sense that she’s “someone with a creative, but skeptical attitude toward technology,” to paraphrase a definition offered by the Chaos Computer Club, Europe’s largest hacker association. “I want this to be a big middle finger to those who say hacking shouldn’t be political,” she said. @donk_enby work has aided other researchers, including one at New York University’s Center for Cybersecurity.

Advertisement

@donk_enby, whose efforts are documented on the website ArchiveTeam.org, said the data will eventually be hosted by the Internet Archive. (The two sites are not affiliated.)

@donk_enby told Gizmodo that she began digging into Parler after the company issued denials about an email leak unearthed by the hacktivist Kirtner, who has been credited with founding the hacker group Anonymous. @donk_enby said she was able to independently locate the same material herself at the time.

Kirtaner, creator of 420chan — a.k.a. Aubrey Cottle — reported obtaining 6.3 GB of Parler user data from an unsecured AWS server in November. The leak reportedly contained passwords, photos and email addresses from several other companies as well. Parler CEO John Matze later claimed to Business Insider that the data contained only “public information” about users, which had been improperly stored by an email vendor whose contract was subsequently terminated over the leak. (This leak is separate from the debunked claim that Parler was “hacked” in late November, proof of which was determined to be fake.)

In December, Twitter suspended Kirtaner for tweeting, “I’m killing Parler and its fucking glorious,” citing its rules against threatening “violence against an individual or group of people.” Kirtaner’s account remains suspended despite an online campaign urging Twitter’s safety team to reverse its decision. Gregg Housh, an internet activist involved in many early Anonymous campaigns, noted online that the tweet was “not aimed at a person and [was] not actually violent.”

Advertisement

@donk_enby said she believes Twitter has been relying too much on its automated moderation tools, which have led to dubious suspensions of users not actually violating of its rules. This has the effect of “driving people to toxic echo chambers like Parler,” she said.

Parler investor Dan Bongino, a Fox News commentator and former NYPD police officer, said in a Parler post on Saturday — shared on Twitter by BuzzFeed reporter John Paczkowski — that the company was “not done with Apple and Google” and encouraged users to “Stay tuned to hear what’s coming.” One user replied: “It would be a pity if someone with explosives training were to pay a visit to some AWS Data Centers - the location of which are public knowledge.”

Advertisement

On Sunday, CEO Matze sharply criticized the tech companies’ actions, claiming on Fox News that Amazon, Apple, and Google were attempting to “actually destroy the entire company.” Matze added that the company had also been “ditched” by its lawyers.

In an interview last year, Matze said that Parler — which has also taken money from Rebekah Mercer, a deep-pocketed, pro-Trump Republican donor — had planned to generate revenue using an “influencer” model. Prominent users would be tapped to post organic-looking posts promoting outside companies and products. Users could then “boycott” the influencers they didn’t like. On Tuesday, @donk_enby posted images of what the influencer panel looked like, as well as a function that enabled Parler to conceal the capability from certain users.

Parler is unlikely to rebound quickly, if at all. As the Duckbill Group’s Corey Quinn recently explained on Twitter, migrating a large product off AWS can take months of staging and possibly years to execute. Apps that integrate AWS’s wide array of services cannot be easily transposed onto a different hosting environment, Quinn said.

Should the platform relaunch anytime soon, it’s possible in terms of functionality, it will only be a shell of its former self."

WASHINGTON (AP) —

An Alabama man arrested near the U.S. Capitol after the rioting had a truckload of weapons, including components for 11 explosive devices, guns, smoke devices and machetes, along with a note containing information about a member of Congress, prosecutors wrote in court documents Tuesday.

Federal prosecutors wrote that the note and volume of weapons Lonnie Leroy Coffman, 70, had in his truck suggest he had “an intent to provide them to others” and to attack members of Congress. Coffman was charged with multiple firearms crimes.

“This is a defendant with access to firearms and numerous other lethal weapons, dangerous incendiary mixtures creating napalm, who appears to have been motivated to conduct violence against our elected representatives, prosecutors wrote in a motion asking for Coffman to remained jailed until trial.

The note in the truck referred to a judge appointed by then-president Barack Obama as a “bad guy” and gave the name of a member of Congress, noting the representative is of Muslim faith.

“The defendant brought these weapons to the immediate vicinity of the U.S. Capitol Building, and traveled the area with two firearms on his person. The amount of weapons suggests an intent to provide them to others, as no one person could reasonably use so many at once,” prosecutors wrote.

Coffman, who is from Falkville, was arrested the evening of Jan. 6, after a riot in the U.S. Capitol by a mob backing President Donald Trump. The breach of the Capitol followed a rally earlier in the day in which the president spoke.

Prosecutors said Coffman left his truck in the morning that day of chaos and rioting and was arrested when he returned to the truck in the evening. Law enforcement officers said they swept the area after pipe bombs were found near two buildings.

“The defendant told law enforcement that he had been trying to get back to the pickup truck throughout the day, but that he was turned away in light of the explosives investigations,” prosecutors wrote.

Another Alabama man, who was out on bond on drug charges, was taken into custody Monday after being accused of participating in last week’s riot.

Court records show that a judge on Monday revoked the bond for 23-year-old William Watson after prosecutors said he was identified in photographs and video of the riot.

“Video surveillance from inside the Capital Building recorded images of protestors inside the building, including images of the Defendant dressed in a yellow sweatshirt standing next to a man with horned hat. The Defendant was identified by local authorities,” prosecutors wrote in a motion.

The FBI released the image of the bearded man in the yellow sweatshirt among photos of rioters they were hoping to identify.

WRBL reported that Watson was arrested Monday afternoon in Auburn. Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said Watson is in the county jail after having his bond revoked. He does not have any federal charges at this time, according to a search of court records.

Authorities noted that they were also able to identify Watson by the distinctive tattoos on his hand, and that Watson himself appeared to describe his participation in a social media post.

“They wanna call me antifa because I have a video game tattoo on my hand and I was pleading for peaceful discourse. Let em say what they will. The fake news won’t win against thousands of patriots who recorded today,” read a social media post that prosecutors attributed to Watson."

After the House vote, the articles are expected to move immediately to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated a trial — presided over by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts — likely won’t start until the upper chamber returns on Jan. 19.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, is looking at reconvening the chamber under emergency powers granted to Senate leaders in 2004, as a way to move immediately to an impeachment trial. But this would require buy-in from McConnell, who is unlikely to agree to it.

Some top Democrats, including House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), had been privately discussing the idea of holding onto the impeachment article for a few weeks to fast-track the confirmation of Biden’s national security team, but are now rallying around the idea of sending them immediately.

“I think we should pass it and the Senate should take it up immediately,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a lead author of the impeachment resolution, told reporters Monday. “This is urgent. This president represents a real danger to our democracy.”

Biden told reporters Monday afternoon he has spoken to members in both chambers about a potential plan to “bifurcate” the Senate proceedings, with senators potentially holding the trial in the morning and working to confirm his Cabinet nominees in the afternoon.

Unlike Trump’s 2019 impeachment — for abuse of power and obstruction of congressional investigations — several House Republicans appear to be willing to support this effort. Only Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) has said publicly he could vote in favor, though House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming has privately signaled she may support impeachment, according to multiple sources. But there are as many as 10 House Republicans who are seriously weighing it.

Democrats are directing their attention at several GOP members: Reps. John Katko of New York, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Fred Upton of Michigan, Cheney, Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington and Peter Meijer of Michigan.

The move to impeach Trump comes as Democrats continue to mount an eleventh hour pressure campaign for Pence to intervene and remove Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment. The House will also take up a measure on Tuesday night urging Pence to step in and initiate procedures to declare the president unfit and remove him without congressional action.

At a brief House session on Monday morning, the House formally accepted the resignation of Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, who was partly responsible for security arrangements on Jan. 6. And moments later, Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) blocked unanimous consideration of the resolution from Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) that would have urged Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment process to remove Trump from power.

The House will take up the measure on Tuesday night, though it’s not clear when the Senate, which will hold pro forma sessions on Tuesday and Friday, would take up the Raskin resolution. In theory, a senator could try to pass the House resolution by unanimous consent, but as of now it appears unlikely that it would pass.

Although some Democrats have voiced worry that impeaching Trump with just days left in his term could hamstring President-elect Joe Biden’s early weeks in office, momentum has only grown as new and disturbing footage of the violence wrought by the rioters has emerged. That footage included the beating of a Capitol Police officer, yanked out of the building by a crowd of Trump supporters. The officer in the video has not been identified, but it surfaced after the news that at least one officer, Brian Sicknick, died of injuries sustained during the onslaught.

Every new indication that the rioters included a more sophisticated contingent of insurrectionists has inflamed the House anew, even as Republicans have continued to express wariness, if not outright opposition, to impeachment.

""We need to take very seriously what happened ... Hours and days matter,"" Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.) said in an interview. ""I wish we could just hold our breath"" for 10 days. “But I don't think we should or can afford to. I think we’ve seen that our nation and our homeland is in danger.""

""I’ve heard a lot of people say, Is it the right thing politically to impeach this president? ... Will it harm the Democratic Party?"" Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich) said in a press conference Monday. ""In terms of whether it could harm the Democratic Party, I could not care less.""

Democrats’ effort to pressure Trump to resign or force him from office come just nine days left in his term. But Pelosi has argued that Trump is “unhinged” and a threat to America who warrants immediate removal. Some of her allies say acting to remove Trump could box in his worst impulses ahead of his departure and is simply the right thing to do, given his monthslong campaign to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 election, which led to the violent riots.

“In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,” Pelosi said in the letter to Democrats on Sunday night laying out next steps.

Across the Capitol, at least two Republicans — Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — have called on Trump to resign. On Saturday, Toomey told Fox News, “I do think the president committed impeachable offenses,” but told CNN the next day that he does not believe there is enough time to impeach.

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) has also said he would consider articles of impeachment.

FBI agents found a rifle, handgun, and ""hundreds of rounds of ammunition"" in his vehicle in Washington, DC, according to charging documents.

Meredith is an adherent to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which believes that President Donald Trump is fighting a ""deep state"" of Democratic officials who are Satanic cannibals.

A man who traveled to Washington, DC, to participate in President Donald Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally on January 6 has been charged with threatening to kill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr. was confronted by FBI agents on Thursday, January 7, at a Holiday Inn in Washington, DC, where he was staying. He was charged with transmitting a threat, possessing an unregistered firearm, and unlawfully possessing ammunition, according to court documents obtained by the George Washington University Program on Extremism.

""Thinking about heading over to Pelosi C---'s speech and putting a bullet in her noggin on Live TV,"" Mederith said in one text message to an acquaintance, according to charging documents. ""Headed to DC with a s--- ton of 5.56 armor piercing ammo,"" he wrote in another.

According to charging documents, a search of Meredith's vehicles found an assault rifle, a pistol, and ""hundreds of rounds of ammunition."" FBI officials said Meredith told them he moved his weapons to his trailer because he knew he was not supposed to carry weaponry in Washington, DC.

Meredith traveled from Colorado to Washington, DC, to attend Trump's rally where he incited the riot that stormed the Capitol building Wednesday but arrived too late. In another text message reviewed by the FBI, he threatened to run Pelosi over with his truck, according to charging documents.

It's not clear if Meredith was arrested upon being charged. A Justice Department press release says he was charged but does not include his name among the people who have been arrested. A representative for the FBI referred Insider to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Meredith is a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was known in the Atlanta area for erecting a billboard that said ""#QAnon"" along with the name of his company, Car Nutz car wash. The baseless conspiracy theory movement alleges that Trump is secretly fighting a ""deep state"" cabal of satanic, Democratic party pedophiles and cannibals.

""Dead B--- Walking,"" Meredith wrote in one text message obtained by the FBI in an apparent reference to Pelosi. ""I predict that within 12 days, many in our country will die.""

Emails sent to Car Nutz were not immediately returned Monday."
The Police’s Tepid Response To The Capitol Breach Wasn’t An Aberration—Authorities are more than twice as likely to break up a left-wing protest than a right-wing protest.,17,kv029p,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polices-tepid-response-to-the-capitol-breach-wasnt-an-aberration,3,1610389427.0,,"The Police’s Tepid Response To The Capitol Breach Wasn’t An Aberration Authorities are more than twice as likely to break up a left-wing protest than a right-wing protest.

As images from Wednesday’s riot by pro-Trump extremists at the U.S. Capitol filled our TV screens and social media feeds, one thing was notably absent: the kind of confrontation between police and protesters that we saw during the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. Even though the Capitol mob was far more violent — and seditious — than the largely peaceful BLM demonstrators, police responded far less aggressively toward them than toward BLM protesters across the country. Researchers who track this sort of thing for a living say that fits a pattern.





What Trumpism has cost the GOP and the nation | FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast

Instead of National Guard troops being posted en masse around landmarks before a protest even began, we saw the Defense Department initially deny a request to send in troops — and that was after the Capitol had been breached. Instead of peaceful protesters being doused in tear gas, we saw a mob posing for selfies with police and being allowed to wander the corridors of power like they couldn’t decide whether they were invading the Capitol or touring it. Instead of President Trump calling these violent supporters “thugs,” as he called racial justice protesters, and advocating for more violent police crackdowns, we saw him remind his followers that they were loved before asking them nicely to go home.

[Related: Storming The U.S. Capitol Was About Maintaining White Power In America]

“It feels really unbelievable,” said Roudabeh Kishi, director of research and innovation with the nonprofit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. But, she said, it’s also totally unsurprising.

That’s because the discrepancies we saw Wednesday are just another example of a trend Kishi’s team has been tracking for months as they collect data on protester and law enforcement interactions across America. “We see a different response to the right wing,” she said.

While protesters themselves have long perceived that police tend to crack down on left-wing protesters and align with those on the right wing, there hasn’t really been data to demonstrate that effect before, said Ed Maguire, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Arizona State University and an expert on police and protester interactions.

But in 2020, Kishi’s ACLED — a data-reporting project that began documenting armed conflicts and protests in African nations — extended its work into the United States. Using information gathered from local media, NGOs, individual journalists and partner organizations, ACLED researchers have catalogued months of detailed information about protests, including when clashes with law enforcement have happened and the type of force used by police. “We don’t necessarily have information on the number of Black vs. white protesters … but we do have a larger view,” Kishi said. “How is law enforcement responding to demonstrations associated with the Black Lives Matter movement versus demonstrations by the right wing … in support of [a] president that may or may not involve organized armed illegal groups?”

What they have found is striking.





What Trump revealed about America | FiveThirtyEight

Between May 1 and November 28, 2020, authorities were more than twice as likely to attempt to break up and disperse a left-wing protest than a right-wing one. And in those situations when law enforcement chose to intervene, they were more likely to use force — 34 percent of the time with right-wing protests compared with 51 percent of the time for the left. Given when this data was collected, it predominantly reflects a difference in how police respond to Black Lives Matter, compared with how they respond to anti-mask demonstrations, pro-Trump extremists, QAnon rallies, and militia groups.

[Related: QAnon Isn’t Going To Take Over Congress In 2020. But It’s Found A Home In The GOP.]

The differences in intervention weren’t because BLM protests were particularly violent. ACLED found that 93 percent of the protests associated with BLM were entirely peaceful. “Even if we were to put those [7] percent of demonstrations aside and look purely at peaceful [BLM protests], we are seeing a more heavy handed response [compared with right-wing protests],” Kishi said.

This data is new and limited, but it is in keeping with long-documented biases in how police think about and treat Black people compared with white people, and with research that shows police and military personnel overlapping significantly with the same far-right groups they treat preferentially.

It is also in keeping with how different groups of protesters perceive the situation themselves, Maguire said. In his years spent traveling to protests and embedding in crowds to observe and document police and protester interactions, he has interviewed protesters extensively. “Protesters on the left virtually universally believe that police are rougher on them. And protesters on the right almost universally believe police are on their side,” Maguire said. Some of that sentiment was evident yesterday:

“This is not America,” a woman said to a small group, her voice shaking. “They’re shooting at us. They’re supposed to shoot BLM, but they’re shooting the patriots.” https://t.co/XN2pSct54i — The Nation (@thenation) January 7, 2021

Even absent statistical evidence, those beliefs have consequences, Maguire told me. “I think protesters on the right, because they view the police as in their corner, they feel a sense of tacit permission,” he said. This is only exacerbated when police live up to those expectations. But, while it is true that law enforcement responded with far less force to Wednesday’s storming of the Capitol than to Black Lives Matter protests, there was some force, which resulted in one woman being shot and killed by police.

And Maguire says this represents a jarring breach between the treatment right-wing extremists expect and the reality. The consequences of that worry him. He’s been watching this year as those extremists’ beliefs about themselves and their relationship with police grew increasingly religious and apocalyptic. “[They told me] that leftists are godless and they hate god and hate America. That’s what I heard from folks on the right. [But] they were god fearing moral people and police would always back them for that reason,” he said. Now, you have a situation where police are giving these people more leeway and, at the same time, right-wing groups may perceive their relationship with police being undermined. “I can … see the possibility that people who feel the police have broken some type of implicit or imagined pact may try to outmaneuver police and behave destructively,” he said.

[Related: How Trump Changed America]

The police, meanwhile, he worries, are likely to see criticism of a lack of force in D.C. and respond with more force elsewhere — whether that be against right-wing or left-wing groups. “Every other police department facing an angry crowd will be concerned about being overrun, and overcorrecting in response to that concern may lead to overly forceful, unconstitutional responses.”

Violence, as they say, begets violence. And disparities in police force may well beget more disparities.

The former chief of U.S. Capitol Police says security officials at the House and Senate rebuffed his early requests to call in the National Guard ahead of a demonstration in support of President Trump that turned into a deadly attack on Congress.

Former chief Steven Sund -- who resigned his post last week after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for him to step down -- made the assertions in an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday.

Sund contradicts claims made by officials after Wednesday's assault on Capitol Hill. Sund's superiors said previously that the National Guard and other additional security support could have been provided, but no one at the Capitol requested it.

Sund told the Post that House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving was concerned with the ""optics"" of declaring an emergency ahead of the protests and rejected a National Guard presence. He says Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger recommended that he informally request the Guard to be ready in case it was needed to maintain security.

Like Sund, Irving and Stenger have also since resigned their posts.

Sund says he requested assistance six times ahead of and during the attack on the Capitol. Each of those requests was denied or delayed, he says.

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser also wanted a light police presence at the Capitol. She reportedly wanted to avoid a similar scenario as last summer, when federal forces responded to demonstrators opposed to police abuses who assembled near the White House.

During Wednesday's violence, Bowser requested, and received, a limited force of 340 from the D.C. National Guard. Those troops were unarmed and their job was to help with traffic flow — not law enforcement, which was meant to be handled by D.C. police.

When the mob reached the Capitol complex at about 12:40 p.m. ET on Wednesday, it took about 15 minutes for the west side perimeter of the building to be breached, he says. The Capitol Police contingent, which numbered around 1,400 that day, was quickly overrun by the estimated 8,000 rioters.

""If we would have had the National Guard we could have held them at bay longer, until more officers from our partner agencies could arrive,"" he says.

Sund says during a conference call with several law enforcement officials at about 2:26 p.m., he asked the Pentagon to provide backup.

Senior Army official Lt. Gen. Walter E. Piatt, director of the Army Staff, said on the call he couldn't recommend that Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy authorize deployment, Sund and others on the call told the Post. Piatt reportedly said, ""I don't like the visual of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background,"" the Post reported.

It would be more than three hours before any National Guard troops arrived, well after the damage at the Capitol had been done.

In the interview, Sund also issued a warning to federal officials, saying ""if they don't get their act together with physical security, it's going to happen again."""
Donald Trump axes discrimination protections in ‘parting assault on LGBT+ community’,76,kukq7d,https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/09/donald-trump-lgbt-discrimination-protections-health-human-services/,48,1610335065.0,,"Donald Trump holds an LGBT+ Pride flag given to him by supporter. (Getty/ Chip Somodevilla)

Donald Trump has launched a “parting assault on the LGBT+ community” in America by stripping discrimination protections, days before he leaves office.

Amid the fallout from extremist riots at the US capitol, Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has officially adopted new rules allowing recipients of federal HHS grants to discriminate against LGBT+ people in the name of religious freedom.

The final regulations, which were proposed in November, 2019, were released Thursday (7 January) in an 86-page document.

They roll back Obama-era rules which ban discrimination by those receiving grants from HHS against people on the basis of age, disability, sex, race, colour, national origin, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation.

The rules also rescind the requirement for HHS grantees to “treat as valid the marriages of same-sex couples”.

Now, the regulations read: “It is a public policy requirement of HHS that no person otherwise eligible will be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination in the administration of HHS programs and services, to the extent doing so is prohibited by federal statute.”

Except federal statute does not protect LGBT+ people from discrimination, therefore Trump has effectively given HHS grantees the green light to discriminate against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Where the HHS regulations used to require grantees to treat same-sex marriages as valid, they now read: “HHS will follow all applicable Supreme Court decisions in administering its award programs.”

While the change allow discrimination under the guise of “religious liberty” in healthcare services like HIV and STI prevention programs, opioid programs and youth homelessness services, adoption and fostering services also come under the HSS department.

If faith-based adoption and fostering services are funded by the government, they will be able to refuse to place children with families based on sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status, a change that religious conservatives have been pushing for.

Alphonso David, president of Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement: “At the 11th hour, the lame duck Trump-Pence administration has published its parting assault on the LGBT+ community via a federal regulation that would permit discrimination across the entire spectrum of HHS programs receiving federal funding.

“The Biden-Harris administration and Secretary Designate Xavier Becerra must urgently work to rescind this discriminatory regulation.”"
‘Our President Wants Us Here’: The Mob That Stormed the Capitol,378,kuigbv,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/us/capitol-rioters.html,91,1610327783.0,,"Now, dozens of them have been arrested — including an armed Alabama man who had Molotov cocktails in his car and a West Virginia lawmaker charged with illegally entering the Capitol — and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is asking for help in identifying those who “actively instigated violence.” Many participants in the march are frantically working to erase digital evidence of their presence for fear of losing a job or being harassed online.

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been broadly condemned and cut off from his social media megaphones, as a new administration prepares to take power.

Kevin Haag, 67, a retired landscaper from North Carolina who ascended the Capitol steps as the crowd surged forward, said he did not go inside and disapproved of those who did. Even so, he said he would never forget the sense of empowerment as he looked down over thousands of protesters. It felt so good, he said, to show people: “We are here. See us! Notice us! Pay attention!”

Now, back home after several days of reflection, Mr. Haag, an evangelical Christian, wonders whether he went too far. “Should I get down on my knees and ask for forgiveness?” he said in an interview. “I am asking myself that question.”

But the experience seemed to have only hardened the resolve of others. Couy Griffin, 47, a Republican county commissioner from New Mexico, spoke of organizing another Capitol rally soon — one that could result in “blood running out of that building” — in a video he later posted to the Facebook page of his group, Cowboys for Trump."

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia lawmakers are set to start this year’s legislative session focused on COVID-19 relief efforts and legalizing marijuana.

The 2021 session will kick off Wednesday, with lawmakers meeting away from the Capitol as the state continues to wrestle with the impacts of a global pandemic that’s shut down schools, closed businesses and left more than 5,000 Virginians dead in last 10 months, including a state senator.

The House of Delegates plans to meet remotely, while the Senate will meet at a large conference center near the Capitol. This will be the second regular legislative session controlled by Democrats since they won control of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation in 2019.

Republicans, upset that the House is meeting remotely and that lawmakers held an extended special session last year, have signaled they will limit what’s normally a 45-day session to only 30 days. Democrats can extend the the number of legislative working days by having Gov. Ralph Northam call a special session.

Here’s a look at key issues that lawmakers will debate:

MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION:

Northam is pushing to legalize marijuana for recreational use in Virginia, which could be the first Southern state to do so. Northam announced his support for legalization in November, saying he wants a responsible approach that promotes racial equity and preserves youth safety.

It’s unclear if there are enough votes for the measure to pass, but lawmakers in both parties have been more open to marijuana issues, and the state decriminalized the drug last year.

Northam’s push comes as marijuana becomes more broadly accepted throughout the United States.

COVID-19 RELIEF & STATE BUDGET:

Like in every session, lawmakers will have to deal with adjustments to the state’s spending plan.

Northam outlined his proposed amendments last month, presenting a plan that includes hundreds of millions in spending on the pandemic response and restores Democratic priorities put on hold in the spring over economic uncertainty.

The governor’s proposals typically serve as a starting point for lawmakers. Administration officials have said the governor’s proposals account for the fact that Virginia’s economy has held up better than expected amid the pandemic. The proposal is based on a revenue forecast that anticipates $1.2 billion more than a forecast released in August.

Northam’s proposal restores about half of the $2.7 billion in spending that was put on hold earlier this year, including funding allocated for expanding access to early childhood education, for higher education tuition assistance and for his G3 Program to provide free or low-cost job skills training at community colleges.

State Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg said a top priority will be ensuring that schools have “robust” funding, including money for extra counselors, to help teachers deal with the fallout from the coronavirus once students return to the classroom.

“It’s not going to be smooth,” said VanValkenburg, who is also a high school teacher.

Virginia currently has a mix of schools currently offering in-person and virtual instruction.

Liberal lawmakers are also set to push for paid sick leave as part of the state’s coronavirus relief efforts. Similar bills failed to pass last year.

DEATH PENALTY REPEAL

Opponents of the death penalty are confident there’s a real shot of getting legislation through the General Assembly that would end executions in Virginia.

Democratic Sen. Scott Surovell is again sponsoring a death penalty repeal bill, and Republican Sen. Bill Stanley said he will sign on this year as a chief co-patron. The measure would commute the sentences of the only two inmates on Virginia’s death row to life in prison without parole.

OTHER ISSUES

Other issues that will likely see pitched debate this session include Democrats’ push to expand voting access.

And Del. Marcus Simon said he’s going to push for legislation to bring Virginia in line with almost every other state and ban the personal use of political campaign funds. Despite support for such a measure by officials in both parties, including Northam, the legislation has recieved a cool reception by the General Assembly in past years."
"Amazon, Apple, and Google Cut Off Parler, an App That Drew Trump Supporters",327,ku69ca,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/apple-google-parler.html,140,1610277581.0,,"Amazon, Apple and Google’s moves could also spur other apps to strengthen their enforcement.

DLive, a livestreaming site that rioters storming the Capitol used to broadcast the moment, said on Friday that it had indefinitely suspended seven channels and permanently removed over 100 previous broadcasts of the mob. It added that the “lemons,” a DLive currency that can be converted into real money, sent to the suspended channels would be refunded to donors in the next few days.

Other platforms that host posts by right-wing influencers, including CloutHub and MyMilitia — a forum for militia groups — adjusted their terms of service recently to ban threats of violence.

DLive was pressured by Tipalti, a payment company that helps it operate. Tipalti said in a statement that it had suspended its service until DLive removed the accounts that had broadcast the riots on Wednesday.

Such third-party companies that help apps and websites function, from payment processors to cybersecurity firms to web-hosting providers like Amazon, have used their positions to influence how their customers handle extremist or criminal activity. In 2019, Cloudflare, a company that protects sites from cyberattacks, effectively delivered the death knell to 8chan, an anonymous online message board that hosted the manifesto of a mass shooter, by halting its protections for the site. After Cloudflare backed away from 8chan, the site struggled to find other service providers that could keep it active.

Parler could have the same problem now that it lacked a way to host its website, particularly as the company suddenly became a pariah after Wednesday’s riot, which was partially planned on Parler. Amazon had faced pressure from its own employees and at least one member of Congress before it pulled its support for Parler, and other companies could fear unwanted attention if they took its business.

BuzzFeed News first reported Amazon’s decision to pull its support for Parler.

If Parler is able to find a provider and resume its service, it will still have an uphill journey to find new users without a place in the major app stores. Apple’s decision blocks iPhone owners from downloading the Parler app. People who already have the app will still be able to use it — if it comes back online — but their versions of the app will soon become obsolete as Apple updates the iPhone software.

Google cut Parler out of its flagship Android app store, but it also allows apps to be downloaded from elsewhere, meaning Android users would still be able to find the Parler app, just with a bit more work. If Parler finds a new web-hosting provider, its website would also be available via web browsers on phones and computers."

FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky’s anti-abortion attorney general would be given new power to regulate abortion clinics under a bill that won final passage Saturday from the Republican-dominated legislature.

The Senate voted 30-5 to send the measure to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who vetoed similar legislation in 2020. Last year’s bill passed shortly before the session ended, preventing lawmakers from overriding the veto. Now, just days into their 30-day session, lawmakers would have plenty of time to take up an override of this year’s bill.

The abortion-related proposal became the first bill to clear the legislature during this year’s pandemic-dominated session. In the opening week of the session, GOP lawmakers expedited work on bills dealing with abortion and limiting the governor’s emergency powers to deal with the COVID-19 crisis.

The abortion proposal that passed Saturday would give Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron the power to seek civil and criminal penalties for any violation of Kentucky’s abortion laws.

Cameron tweeted Saturday that he was grateful for lawmakers giving his office “clear legal authority to act” if an abortion law is violated.

In recent years, Kentucky lawmakers have moved aggressively to put restrictions and conditions on abortion since Republicans assumed total control of the General Assembly.

Democratic Sen. Karen Berg criticized lawmakers for making the abortion measure a priority at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is raging.

“This is what we are spending our time, our energy and our taxpayers’ money on,” she said Saturday. “I think it is a great disservice to the people of this commonwealth.”

The attorney general’s new powers would be concurrent with state Cabinet for Health and Family Services’ authority to enforce abortion laws and seek penalties for violations, said Republican Sen. Whitney Westerfield.

Abortion-rights advocates called the bill a shift in power to the anti-abortion attorney general. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Indiana and Kentucky said in a release that Cameron “has no medical background and has showed he’ll use the powers of his office to push abortion care out of reach” for Kentuckians.

Another bill backed by abortion opponents that won final passage Saturday would require doctors to give life-saving measures to any infant “born alive” during a “failed abortion” or premature birth.

The measure also was included in the 2020 legislation vetoed by Beshear. The governor noted in his veto message that existing law already protects the life of infants."

Twitter permanently bans President Donald Trump,593,ktenzk,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-permanently-bans-president-donald-trump-n1253588,195,1610177377.0,,"Twitter permanently suspended President Donald Trump’s account on Friday, citing “the risk of further incitement of violence.”

The president’s account, with 88 million followers, was initially banned for 12 hours on Wednesday due to “severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,” after he used the platform to condemn Vice President Mike Pence as his supporters stormed the Capitol.

“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” the company said in a tweet.

Almost immediately, the account that Trump had used for years to convey his every thought, to denounce his enemies and praise his friends, to convey uncountable false statements and official White House announcements, simply disappeared. It was suddenly impossible to see his previous tweets, or even to see his reaction to Twitter's decision. Instead, his empty account had been marked: ""Account suspended.""

Trump's attempts to tweet from associated accounts also were blocked. At one point, he was tweeting from his campaign account, but that was promptly suspended.

In a blog post, Twitter detailed the reasoning behind the decision.

“In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action,” Twitter wrote. “Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open.”

“However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence,” the post continued. “We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Twitter banned the president’s account after years of public pressure and several attempts to limit the reach of his account in recent days. Hundreds of Twitter employees recently signed a letter urging Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to ban the president for using the platform to incite violence in the wake of the Capitol siege. An employee at Twitter who has been pushing for the company to delete the president’s account this week told NBC News that “leadership took a beating” at a meeting Friday morning with employees, many of whom pleaded with executives to delete his account.

“A lot of us are so happy, and so proud to work for a company that did the right thing,” the employee said.

This was the second time in a week Twitter had taken action against the president’s account. Twitter removed three tweets that promoted conspiracy theories about the election and locked Trump’s account on Wednesday, citing “a risk of violence,” after a violent riot at the Capitol. Trump’s official @POTUS account is still active, but if the company determines he’s using it to evade the ban, it will take action to limit its use, a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement.

About two hours after his ban, Trump did turn to the official @POTUS account, railing against Twitter, Democrats, and “the Radical Left,” in a series of tweets that were quickly deleted. A Twitter spokesperson said, “As we’ve said, using another account to try to evade a suspension is against our rules. We have taken steps to enforce this with regard to recent Tweets from the @POTUS.”

In the blog post, Twitter cited Trump’s two most recent tweets as an explanation for the permanent suspension.

In the first one, Trump wrote: “The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”

In the next, he tweeted, “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.”

Taken together, the company determined, they were “likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so.”

The suspension drew immediate praise from Democratic politicians.

""Thank you @twitter for taking this action,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., tweeted. ""We must come together as a country to heal and find a common path forward.""

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., tweeted: ""An overdue step. But it’s important to remember, this is much bigger than one person. It’s about an entire ecosystem that allows misinformation and hate to spread and fester unchecked.""

Republican politicians and Trump loyalists pushed back on the decision.

""Disgusting. Big Tech wants to cancel all 75M @realDonaldTrump supporters,"" tweeted Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump's 2020 campaign.

Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted: ""Silencing people, not to mention the President of the US, is what happens in China not our country. #Unbelievable""

Trump was an early adopter of Twitter, joining the platform in 2009. He has long favored Twitter as a means of communicating his policies, opinions and grievances directly to supporters while circumventing the traditional media.

But after his election in 2016, Trump told ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl that as president he would use the platform differently.

""I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained,"" Trump said. ""I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication.""

Trump was not restrained, using his account to make ad hominem attacks against political opponents and announce public firings, posts that were widely criticized as unpresidential but allowed by Twitter.

In 2020, as the pandemic raged and the president used his account to spread misinformation about Covid-19 and the coming election, Twitter — under fire from public health experts and lawmakers — began to enforce new policies on Trump’s account.

Twitter first took action against Trump’s account last May, adding a warning label to a pair of tweets that claimed mail-in ballots were fraudulent. The label said the tweet contained “potentially misleading information about voting processes.”

In the months that followed, the company played whack-a-mole, adding labels to tweets for violating nearly all of the company’s rules, including abusive behavior, misinformation, glorifying violence and manipulated media.

On election night, Twitter took the unprecedented step of hiding behind warnings tweets from the president that claimed his votes had ""started to magically disappear."" Since then, Twitter has labeled Trump’s tweets disputing the free and fair election — sometimes daily."
"As riot raged at Capitol, Trump tried to call senators to overturn election",80,kte0z8,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/politics/mike-lee-tommy-tuberville-trump-misdialed-capitol-riot/index.html,7,1610175435.0,,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani both mistakenly made calls to Republican Sen. Mike Lee as deadly riots were unfolding at the US Capitol earlier this week, a spokesman for the senator confirmed to CNN -- calls that were intended for another GOP senator the White House was frantically trying to convince to delay the counting of Electoral College votes.

Lee's spokesman said the calls from Trump and his attorney were intended for Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a newly elected Republican from Alabama.

The effort by the White House to get Tuberville to delay certification of the votes provides insight into the President's thinking and priorities as a mob of his supporters lay siege to the iconic building. As the President worked to convince Tuberville to delay the process, he and other top White House officials did little to check in on Vice President Mike Pence while he and members of his family were inside the breached Capitol, a source close to the vice president told CNN.

Trump first called the personal cell phone of Lee, a Utah Republican, shortly after 2 p.m. ET. At that time the senators had been evacuated from the Senate floor and were in a temporary holding room, as a pro-Trump mob began breaching the Capitol.

Lee picked up the phone and Trump identified himself, and it became clear he was looking for Tuberville and had been given the wrong number. Lee, keeping the President on hold, went to find his colleague and handed Tuberville his phone, telling him the President was on the line and had been trying to reach him.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Warnings flashing, Democrats in Congress laid plans Friday for swift impeachment of President Donald Trump, demanding decisive, immediate action to ensure an “unhinged” commander in chief can’t add to the damage they say he’s inflicted or even ignite nuclear war in his final days in office.

As the country comes to terms with the violent siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters that left five dead , the crisis that appears to be among the final acts of his presidency is deepening like few other periods in the nation’s history. With less than two weeks until he’s gone, Democrats want him out — now — and he has few defenders speaking up for him in his own Republican party.

“We must take action,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared on a private conference call with Democrats.

And one prominent Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told the Anchorage Daily News that Trump simply “needs to get out.”

The final days of Trump’s presidency are spinning toward a chaotic end as he holes up at the White House, abandoned by many aides, top Republicans and Cabinet members. After refusing to concede defeat in the November election, he has now promised a smooth transfer of power when Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. But even so, he says he will not attend the inauguration — the first such presidential snub since just after the Civil War.

In Congress, where many have watched and reeled as the president spent four years breaking norms and testing the nation’s guardrails of democracy, Democrats are unwilling to take further chances with only a few days left in his term. The mayhem that erupted Wednesday at the Capitol stunned the world and threatened the traditional peaceful transfer of power.

Pelosi said she had spoken to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley “to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes” for nuclear war. She said Milley assured her longstanding safeguards are in place.

The president has sole authority to order the launch of a nuclear weapon, but a military commander could refuse the order if it were determined to be illegal. Trump has not publicly made such threats, but officials warn of grave danger if the president is left unchecked.

“This unhinged president could not be more dangerous,” Pelosi said of the current situation.

Biden, meanwhile, said he is focused on his job as he prepares to take office. Asked about impeachment, he said, “That’s a decision for the Congress to make.”

The Democrats are considering lightning-quick action. A draft of their Articles of Impeachment accuses Trump of abuse of power, saying he “willfully made statements that encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — imminent lawless action at the Capitol,” according to a person familiar with the details who was granted anonymity to discuss them.

The articles are expected to be introduced on Monday, with a House vote as soon as Wednesday.

If Trump were to be impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, he might also be prevented from running again for the presidency in 2024 or ever holding public office again. He would be only the president twice impeached. A person on the call said Pelosi also discussed other ways Trump might be forced to resign.

Senators from a bipartisan group convened their own call to consider options for congressional action, according to an aide granted anonymity to reveal the private discussions.

Not helpful, the White House argued. Trump spokesman Judd Deere said, “A politically motivated impeachment against a President with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country.”

Trump was tweeting again Friday, his Twitter account reinstated after a brief ban, and he reverted to an aggressive statement that his supporters must not be “disrespected” after he had sent out a calmer Thursday video decrying the violence. Toward evening, Twitter said it was permanently suspending him from its platform, citing “risk of further incitement of violence.”

The soonest the Senate could begin an impeachment trial under the current calendar would be Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.

Conviction in the Republican Senate at this late date would seem unlikely, though in a sign of Trump’s shattering of the party many Republicans were silent on the issue.

One Trump ally, Republican Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, did speak up, saying as the White House did that “impeaching the President with just 12 days left in his term will only divide our country more. ”

McCarthy said he has reached out to Biden and plans to speak with the Democratic president-elect about working together to “lower the temperature.”

But Murkowski said she wants Trump to resign now, not wait for Biden’s swearing in on Jan. 20.

“I want him out,” she said in a telephone interview with the Anchorage newspaper.

Another leading Republican critic of Trump, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, said he would “definitely consider” impeachment.

Strong criticism of Trump, who urged the protesters to march to the Capitol, continued unabated.

“Every day that he remains in office, he is a danger to the Republic,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

Schiff, who led Trump’s impeachment in 2019, said in a statement that Trump “lit the fuse which exploded on Wednesday at the Capitol.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, tweeted that some people ask, why impeach a president who has only a few days left in office?

“The answer: Precedent. It must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the U.S. government,” Sanders said.

Pelosi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer both had private calls with Biden late Friday.

They have called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to to force Trump from office. It’s a process for removing the president and installing the vice president to take over.

Pelosi said later that option remains on the table. But action by Pence or the Cabinet now appears unlikely, especially after two top officials, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao suddenly resigned in the aftermath of the violence and would no longer be in the Cabinet to make such a case.

Trump had encouraged loyalists at a rally Wednesday at the White House to march on the Capitol where Congress was certifying the Electoral College tally of Biden’s election.

The House impeached Trump in 2019, but the Republican-led Senate acquitted him in early 2020.

The invasion of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday was stoked in plain sight. For weeks, the far-right supporters of President Donald Trump railed on social media that the election had been stolen. They openly discussed the idea of violent protest on the day Congress met to certify the result.

“We came up with the idea to occupy just outside the CAPITOL on Jan 6th,” leaders of the Stop the Steal movement wrote on Dec. 23. They called their Wednesday demonstration the Wild Protest, a name taken from a tweet by Trump that encouraged his supporters to take their grievances to the streets of Washington. “Will be wild,” the president tweeted.

Ali Alexander, the founder of the movement, encouraged people to bring tents and sleeping bags and avoid wearing masks for the event. “If D.C. escalates… so do we,” Alexander wrote on Parler last week — one of scores of social media posts welcoming violence that were reviewed by ProPublica in the weeks leading up to Wednesday’s attack on the capitol.

Thousands of people heeded that call.

For reasons that remained unclear Wednesday night, the law enforcement authorities charged with protecting the nation’s entire legislative branch — nearly all of the 535 members of Congress gathered in a joint session, along with Vice President Mike Pence — were ill-prepared to contain the forces massed against them.

On Wednesday afternoon, a thin line of U.S. Capitol Police, with only a few riot shields between them and a knot of angry protesters, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rioters on the steps of the West Front. They struggled with a flimsy set of barricades as a mob in helmets and bulletproof vests pushed its way toward the Capitol entrance. Videos showed officers stepping aside, and sometimes taking selfies, as if to usher Trump’s supporters into the building they were supposed to guard.

A former Capitol policeman well-versed in his agency’s procedures was mystified by the scene he watched unfold on live television. Larry Schaefer, a 34-year Capitol Police veteran who retired in December 2019, said his former colleagues were experienced in dealing with aggressive crowds.

“It’s not a spur-of-the-moment demonstration that just popped up,” Schaefer said. “We have a planned, known demonstration that has a propensity for violence in the past and threats to carry weapons — why would you not prepare yourself as we have done in the past?”

A spokesperson for the Capitol Police did not respond to a request for comment.

In recent years, federal law enforcement agencies have stepped up their focus on far-right groups, resulting in a spate of arrests. In October, the FBI arrested a group of Michigan extremists and charged them with plotting to kidnap the state’s governor. On Monday, Washington police arrested Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys, on charges of burning a Black Lives Matter banner.

Conversations on right-wing platforms are monitored closely by federal intelligence. In September, a draft report by the Department of Homeland Security surfaced, identifying white supremacists as the biggest threat to national security.

The warnings of Wednesday’s assault on the Capitol were everywhere — perhaps not entirely specific about the planned time and exact location of an assault on the Capitol, but enough to clue in law enforcement about the potential for civil unrest.

On Dec. 12, a poster on the website MyMilitia.com urged violence if senators made official the victory of President-elect Joe Biden.

Wrote another person: “It’s already apparent that literally millions of Americans are on the verge of activating their Second Amendment duty to defeat tyranny and save the republic.”

The easily overpowered police force guarding the Capitol on Wednesday posed a stark contrast to the tactics deployed by local police during this summer’s Black Lives Matter protests. Then, the city felt besieged by law enforcement.

On June 1, following a few days of mostly peaceful protests, the National Guard, the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a nonviolent crowd in Lafayette Square outside the White House to allow Trump to pose with a Bible in front of a nearby church.

“We need to dominate the battlespace,” then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on a call with dozens of governors, asking them to send their National Guard forces to the capital.

On June 2 — the day of the primary election in Washington — law enforcement officers appeared on every corner, heavily armed in fatigues and body armor. Humvees blocked intersections. Buses full of troops deployed into military columns and marshaled in front of the Lincoln Memorial in a raw show of force. Police kettled protesters in alleys. Choppers thudded overhead for days and sank low enough over protesters to generate gale-force winds.

Such dominance was nowhere in evidence Wednesday, despite a near-lockdown of the downtown area on Tuesday night. Trump supporters drove to the Capitol and parked in spaces normally reserved for congressional staff. Some vehicles stopped on the lawns near the Tidal Basin.

The contrast shook Washington’s attorney general, Karl Racine, who seemed to be almost in disbelief on CNN Wednesday evening.

“There was zero intelligence that the Black Lives Matter protesters were going to ‘storm the capitol,’” he remembered, after ticking down the many police forces present in June. “Juxtapose that with what we saw today, with hate groups, militia and other groups that have no respect for the rule of law go into the capitol. ... That dichotomy is shocking.”

The question of how law enforcement and the national security establishment failed so spectacularly will likely be the subject of intense focus in coming days.

David Carter, director of the Intelligence Program at Michigan State University, said that sometimes, the best intelligence in the world doesn’t translate into adequate preparedness. Perhaps the security officials responsible for protecting the Capitol simply could not envision that a crowd of Americans would charge through a police line and shatter the glass windows that stood as the only physical barrier to entering the building.

“I go back to the 9/11 commission report,” Carter said. “It was a failure of imagination. They didn’t imagine something like this. Would you imagine people were going to break into the Capitol and go into the chambers? That failure of imagination sometimes makes us drop the ball.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — Three days before supporters of President Donald Trump rioted at the Capitol , the Pentagon asked the U.S Capitol Police if it needed National Guard manpower. And as the mob descended on the building Wednesday, Justice Department leaders reached out to offer up FBI agents. The police turned them down both times, according to senior defense officials and two people familiar with the matter.

Despite plenty of warnings of a possible insurrection and ample resources and time to prepare, the Capitol Police planned only for a free speech demonstration.

Still stinging from the uproar over the violent response by law enforcement to protests last June near the White House, officials also were intent on avoiding any appearance that the federal government was deploying active duty or National Guard troops against Americans.

The result is the U.S. Capitol was overrun Wednesday and officers in a law enforcement agency with a large operating budget and experience in high-security events protecting lawmakers were overwhelmed for the world to see. Four protesters died, including one shot inside the building.

The rioting and loss of control has raised serious questions over security at the Capitol for future events. The actions of the day also raise troubling concerns about the treatment of mainly white Trump supporters, who were allowed to roam through the building for hours, while Black and brown protesters who demonstrated last year over police brutality faced more robust and aggressive policing.

“This was a failure of imagination, a failure of leadership,” said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, whose department responded to several large protests last year following the death of George Floyd. “The Capitol Police must do better and I don’t see how we can get around that.”

Acevedo said he has attended events on the Capitol grounds to honor slain police officers that had higher fences and a stronger security presence than what he saw on video Wednesday.

Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said that as the rioting was underway, it became clear that the Capitol Police were overrun. But he said there was no contingency planning done in advance for what forces could do in case of a problem at the Capitol because Defense Department help was turned down. “They’ve got to ask us, the request has to come to us,” said McCarthy.

U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, under pressure from Schumer, Pelosi and other congressional leaders, was forced to resign. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asked for and received the resignation of the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, Michael Stenger, effective immediately. Paul Irving, the longtime Sergeant at Arms of the House, also resigned.

“There was a failure of leadership at the top,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.

The U.S. Capitol had been closed to the public since March because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 360,000 people in the U.S. But normally, the building is open to the public and lawmakers pride themselves on their availability to their constituents.

It is not clear how many officers were on-duty Wednesday, but the complex is policed by a total of 2,300 officers for 16 acres of ground who protect the 435 House representatives, 100 U.S. senators and their staff. By comparison, the city of Minneapolis has about 840 uniformed officers policing a population of 425,000 in a 6,000-acre area.

There were signs for weeks that violence could strike on Jan. 6, when Congress convened for a joint session to finish counting the Electoral College votes that would confirm Democrat Joe Biden had won the presidential election.

On far-right message boards and in pro-Trump circles, plans were being made.

The leader of the far-right extremist group Proud Boys was arrested coming into the nation’s capital this week on a weapons charge for carrying empty high-capacity magazines emblazoned with their logo. He admitted to police that he had made statements about rioting in Washington, local officials said.

Both Acevedo and Ed Davis, a former Boston police commissioner who led the department during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, said they did not fault the responses of clearly overmatched front-line officers, but the planning and leadership before the riot.

“Was there a structural feeling that well, these are a bunch of conservatives, they’re not going to do anything like this? Quite possibly,” Davis said. “That’s where the racial component to this comes into play in my mind. Was there a lack of urgency or a sense that this could never happen with this crowd? Is that possible? Absolutely.”

Trump and his allies were perhaps the biggest megaphones, encouraging protesters to turn out in force and support his false claim that the election had been stolen from him. He egged them on during a rally shortly before they marched to the Capitol and rioted. His personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, a former New York mayor known for his tough-on-crime stance, called for “trial by combat.”

McCarthy said law enforcement’s intelligence estimates of the potential crowd size in the run-up to the protests “were all over the board,” from a low of 2,000 to as many as 80,000.

So the Capitol Police had set up no hard perimeter around the Capitol. Officers were focused on one side where lawmakers were entering to vote to certify Biden’s win.

Barricades were set up on the plaza in front of the building, but police retreated from the line and a mob of people broke through. Lawmakers, at first unaware of the security breach, continued their debate. Soon they were cowering under chairs. Eventually they were escorted from the House and Senate. Journalists were left alone in rooms for hours as the mob attempted to break into barricaded rooms.

Sund, the Capitol Police chief, said he had expected a display of “First Amendment activities” that instead turned into a “violent attack.” But Gus Papathanasiou, head of the Capitol Police union, said planning failures left officers exposed without backup or equipment against surging crowds of rioters.

“We were lucky that more of those who breached the Capitol did not have firearms or explosives and did not have a more malign intent,” Papathanasiou said in a statement. “Tragic as the deaths are that resulted from the attack, we are fortunate the casualty toll was not higher.”

The Justice Department, FBI and other agencies began to monitor hotels, flights and social media for weeks and were expecting large crowds. Mayor Muriel Bowser had warned of impending violence for weeks, and businesses had closed in anticipation. She requested National Guard help from the Pentagon on Dec. 31, but the Capitol Police turned down the Jan. 3 offer from the Defense Department, according to Kenneth Rapuano, assistant defense secretary for homeland security.

“We asked more than once and the final return that we got on Sunday the 3rd was that they would not be asking DOD for assistance,” he said.

The Justice Department’s offer for FBI support as the protesters grew violent was rejected by the Capitol Police, according to the two people familiar with the matter. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.

By then, it was too late.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police Department descended. Agents from nearly every Justice Department agency, including the FBI, were called in. So was the Secret Service and the Federal Protective Service. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent two tactical teams. Police from as far away as New Jersey arrived to help.

It took four hours to evict the protesters from the Capitol complex. By then, they had roamed the halls of Congress, posed for photos inside hallowed chambers, broken through doors, destroyed property and taken photos of themselves doing it. Only 13 were arrested at the time; scores were arrested later.

In the aftermath, a 7-foot fence will go up around the Capitol grounds for at least 30 days. The Capitol Police will conduct a review of the carnage, as well as their planning and policies. Lawmakers plan to investigate how authorities handled the rioting.

The acting U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said the failure to arrest more people is making their jobs harder.

“Look, we have to now go through cell site orders, collect video footage to try to identify people and then charge them, and then try to execute their arrest. So that has made things challenging, but I can’t answer why those people weren’t zip-tied as they were leaving the building by the Capitol Police.”

Trump finally concedes -- amid talk of ouster from office,15,ksscah,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-cabinets-media-violence-michael-pence-b363a0e31c4504cc221b7d848be8edac,6,1610099332.0,,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With 13 days left in his term, President Donald Trump finally bent to reality Thursday amid growing talk of trying to force him out early, acknowledging he’ll peacefully leave after Congress affirmed his defeat.

Trump led off a video from the White House by condemning the violence carried out in his name a day earlier at the Capitol. Then, for the first time on camera, he admitted his presidency would soon end — though he declined to mention President-elect Joe Biden by name or explicitly state he had lost.

“A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20,” Trump said in the video. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.”

The address, which appeared designed to stave off talk of a forced early eviction, came at the end of a day when the cornered president stayed out of sight in the White House. Silenced on some of his favorite internet lines of communication, he watched the resignations of several top aides, including two Cabinet secretaries.

And as officials sifted through the aftermath of the pro-Trump mob’s siege of the U.S. Capitol, there was growing discussion of impeaching him a second time or invoking the 25th Amendment to oust him from the Oval Office.

The invasion of the Capitol building , a powerful symbol of the nation’s democracy, rattled Republicans and Democrats alike. They struggled with how best to contain the impulses of a president deemed too dangerous to control his own social media accounts but who remains commander in chief of the world’s greatest military.

“I’m not worried about the next election, I’m worried about getting through the next 14 days,” said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s staunchest allies. He condemned the president’s role in Wednesday’s riots and said, “If something else happens, all options would be on the table.”

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared that “the president of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America.” She called him “a very dangerous person who should not continue in office. This is urgent, an emergency of the highest magnitude.”

Neither option to remove Trump seemed likely, with little time left in his term to draft the Cabinet members needed to invoke the amendment or to organize the hearings and trial mandated for an impeachment . But the fact that the dramatic options were even the subject of discussion in Washington’s corridors of power served as a warning to Trump.

Fears of what a desperate president could do in his final days spread in the nation’s capital and beyond, including speculation Trump could incite more violence, make rash appointments, issue ill-conceived pardons — including for himself and his family — or even trigger a destabilizing international incident.

The president’s video Thursday — which was released upon his return to Twitter after his account was restored — was a complete reversal from the one he put out just 24 hours earlier in which he said to the violent mob: “We love you. You’re very special.” His refusal to condemn the violence sparked a firestorm of criticism and, in the new video, he at last denounced the demonstrators’ “lawlessness and mayhem.”

As for his feelings on leaving office, he told the nation that “serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime” while hinting at a return to the public arena. He told supporters “our incredible journey is only just beginning.”

Just a day earlier, Trump unleashed the destructive forces at the Capitol with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally that prompted supporters to disrupt the congressional certification of Biden’s victory. After the storming of the Capitol and the eventual wee-hours certification of Biden’s win by members of Congress, Trump released a statement that acknowledged he would abide by a peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 20.

The statement was posted by an aide and did not originate from the president’s own Twitter account, which has 88 million followers and for four years has been wielded as a political weapon that dictates policy and sows division and conspiracy.

Trump couldn’t tweet it himself because, for the first time, the social media platform suspended his account, stating that the president had violated its rules of service by inciting violence. Facebook adopted a broader ban, saying Trump’s account would be offline until after Biden’s inauguration.

Deprived of that social media lifeblood, Trump remained silent and ensconced in the executive mansion until Thursday evening. But around him, loyalists headed for the exits, their departures — which were coming in two weeks anyway — moved up to protest the president’s handling of the riot.

Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao became the first Cabinet member to resign. Chao, married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of the lawmakers trapped at the Capitol on Wednesday, said in a message to staff that the attack “has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.”

Full Coverage: Election 2020

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos followed. In her resignation letter Thursday, DeVos blamed Trump for inflaming tensions in the violent assault on the seat of the nation’s democracy. “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,” she wrote.

Others who resigned in the wake of the riot: Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger; Ryan Tully, senior director for European and Russian affairs at the National Security Council; and first lady Melania Trump’s chief of staff Stephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary.

Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff-turned-special envoy to Northern Ireland, told CNBC that he had called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “to let him know I was resigning. ... I can’t do it. I can’t stay.”

Mulvaney said others who work for Trump had decided to remain in their posts in an effort to provide some sort of guardrails for the president during his final days in office.

“Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they’re worried the president might put someone worse in,” Mulvaney said.

Mulvaney’s predecessor in the chief of staff job, retired U.S. Marine Corps general John Kelly, told CNN that “I think the Cabinet should meet and have a discussion” about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment — allowing the forceful removal of Trump by his own Cabinet.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer joined Pelosi in declaring that Trump “should not hold office one day longer” and urged Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to act. But Chao’s departure may stall nascent efforts to invoke the amendment.

Staff-level discussions on the matter took place across multiple departments and even in parts of the White House, according to two people briefed on the talks. But no member of the Cabinet has publicly expressed support for the move — which would make Pence the acting president — though several were believed to be sympathetic to the notion, believing Trump is too volatile in his waning days in office.

In the West Wing, shell-shocked aides were packing up, acting on a delayed directive to begin offboarding their posts ahead of the Biden team’s arrival. The slowdown before now was due to Trump’s single-minded focus on his defeat since Election Day at the expense of the other responsibilities of his office.

Most glaringly, that included the fight against the raging coronavirus that is killing record numbers of Americans each day.

Few aides had any sense of the president’s plans, with some wondering if Trump would largely remain out of sight until he left the White House. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany read a brief statement in which she declared that the Capitol siege was “appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way.”

But her words carried little weight. Trump has long made clear that only he speaks for his presidency.

The Police’s Tepid Response To The Capitol Breach Wasn’t An Aberration,467,ksl7b5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polices-tepid-response-to-the-capitol-breach-wasnt-an-aberration/,118,1610078081.0,,"The Police’s Tepid Response To The Capitol Breach Wasn’t An Aberration Authorities are more than twice as likely to break up a left-wing protest than a right-wing protest.

As images from Wednesday’s riot by pro-Trump extremists at the U.S. Capitol filled our TV screens and social media feeds, one thing was notably absent: the kind of confrontation between police and protesters that we saw during the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. Even though the Capitol mob was far more violent — and seditious — than the largely peaceful BLM demonstrators, police responded far less aggressively toward them than toward BLM protesters across the country. Researchers who track this sort of thing for a living say that fits a pattern.





What Trumpism has cost the GOP and the nation | FiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast

Instead of National Guard troops being posted en masse around landmarks before a protest even began, we saw the Defense Department initially deny a request to send in troops — and that was after the Capitol had been breached. Instead of peaceful protesters being doused in tear gas, we saw a mob posing for selfies with police and being allowed to wander the corridors of power like they couldn’t decide whether they were invading the Capitol or touring it. Instead of President Trump calling these violent supporters “thugs,” as he called racial justice protesters, and advocating for more violent police crackdowns, we saw him remind his followers that they were loved before asking them nicely to go home.

[Related: Storming The U.S. Capitol Was About Maintaining White Power In America]

“It feels really unbelievable,” said Roudabeh Kishi, director of research and innovation with the nonprofit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. But, she said, it’s also totally unsurprising.

That’s because the discrepancies we saw Wednesday are just another example of a trend Kishi’s team has been tracking for months as they collect data on protester and law enforcement interactions across America. “We see a different response to the right wing,” she said.

While protesters themselves have long perceived that police tend to crack down on left-wing protesters and align with those on the right wing, there hasn’t really been data to demonstrate that effect before, said Ed Maguire, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Arizona State University and an expert on police and protester interactions.

But in 2020, Kishi’s ACLED — a data-reporting project that began documenting armed conflicts and protests in African nations — extended its work into the United States. Using information gathered from local media, NGOs, individual journalists and partner organizations, ACLED researchers have catalogued months of detailed information about protests, including when clashes with law enforcement have happened and the type of force used by police. “We don’t necessarily have information on the number of Black vs. white protesters … but we do have a larger view,” Kishi said. “How is law enforcement responding to demonstrations associated with the Black Lives Matter movement versus demonstrations by the right wing … in support of [a] president that may or may not involve organized armed illegal groups?”

What they have found is striking.





What Trump revealed about America | FiveThirtyEight

Between May 1 and November 28, 2020, authorities were more than twice as likely to attempt to break up and disperse a left-wing protest than a right-wing one. And in those situations when law enforcement chose to intervene, they were more likely to use force — 34 percent of the time with right-wing protests compared with 51 percent of the time for the left. Given when this data was collected, it predominantly reflects a difference in how police respond to Black Lives Matter, compared with how they respond to anti-mask demonstrations, pro-Trump extremists, QAnon rallies, and militia groups.

[Related: QAnon Isn’t Going To Take Over Congress In 2020. But It’s Found A Home In The GOP.]

The differences in intervention weren’t because BLM protests were particularly violent. ACLED found that 93 percent of the protests associated with BLM were entirely peaceful. “Even if we were to put those [7] percent of demonstrations aside and look purely at peaceful [BLM protests], we are seeing a more heavy handed response [compared with right-wing protests],” Kishi said.

This data is new and limited, but it is in keeping with long-documented biases in how police think about and treat Black people compared with white people, and with research that shows police and military personnel overlapping significantly with the same far-right groups they treat preferentially.

It is also in keeping with how different groups of protesters perceive the situation themselves, Maguire said. In his years spent traveling to protests and embedding in crowds to observe and document police and protester interactions, he has interviewed protesters extensively. “Protesters on the left virtually universally believe that police are rougher on them. And protesters on the right almost universally believe police are on their side,” Maguire said. Some of that sentiment was evident yesterday:

“This is not America,” a woman said to a small group, her voice shaking. “They’re shooting at us. They’re supposed to shoot BLM, but they’re shooting the patriots.” https://t.co/XN2pSct54i — The Nation (@thenation) January 7, 2021

Even absent statistical evidence, those beliefs have consequences, Maguire told me. “I think protesters on the right, because they view the police as in their corner, they feel a sense of tacit permission,” he said. This is only exacerbated when police live up to those expectations. But, while it is true that law enforcement responded with far less force to Wednesday’s storming of the Capitol than to Black Lives Matter protests, there was some force, which resulted in one woman being shot and killed by police.

And Maguire says this represents a jarring breach between the treatment right-wing extremists expect and the reality. The consequences of that worry him. He’s been watching this year as those extremists’ beliefs about themselves and their relationship with police grew increasingly religious and apocalyptic. “[They told me] that leftists are godless and they hate god and hate America. That’s what I heard from folks on the right. [But] they were god fearing moral people and police would always back them for that reason,” he said. Now, you have a situation where police are giving these people more leeway and, at the same time, right-wing groups may perceive their relationship with police being undermined. “I can … see the possibility that people who feel the police have broken some type of implicit or imagined pact may try to outmaneuver police and behave destructively,” he said.

[Related: How Trump Changed America]

The police, meanwhile, he worries, are likely to see criticism of a lack of force in D.C. and respond with more force elsewhere — whether that be against right-wing or left-wing groups. “Every other police department facing an angry crowd will be concerned about being overrun, and overcorrecting in response to that concern may lead to overly forceful, unconstitutional responses.”

Violence, as they say, begets violence. And disparities in police force may well beget more disparities.

A day after his supporters rioted inside the U.S. Capitol, President Donald Trump turned his attention to golf.

Trump on Thursday awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to retired professional golfers Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player, and posthumously to Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who died in 1956.

Trump, who in his last public appearance Wednesday urged Vice President Mike Pence to reject the results of the November election, delivered the medals in a closed-door ceremony.

Trump's remarks to supporters at the rally outside the White House came just before a joint session of Congress convened to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory.

Pence, who presided over the event, declined Trump's demands to reject lawfully cast electoral votes.

Trump's supporters swarmed the Capitol, breaking through lines of law enforcement officers and invading the halls of Congress. The riots halted the proceedings and resulted in lockdowns and evacuation and the deaths of at least four people. At least 50 police officers were injured, police said. The National Guard was activated to respond to the attack."

Police Chief Robert J. Contee said there were three other deaths. USA TODAY

U.S. Capitol Police identified military veteran Ashli Babbitt as the woman who was shot Wednesday amid a riot inside the Capitol.

""As protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn (U.S. Capitol Police) employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female,"" police said in a statement Thursday. ""Medical assistance was rendered immediately, and the female was transported to the hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries. She has been identified as Ashli Babbitt.""

The employee has been placed on administrative leave and their police powers have been suspended pending the outcome of a joint Metropolitan Police Department and Capitol Police investigation, police said.

Three other people also died Wednesday, from medical emergencies. They were Benjamin Phillips, 50, from Ri, Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, from Athens, Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, from Kennesaw, Georgia, District of Columbia police Chief Robert Contee III said in a news conference Thursday.

It was not immediately clear how they died. ""They were on the grounds of the Capitol when they experienced the medical emergency,"" Contee said. Boyland's family declined to comment.

Timeline: How a Trump mob stormed the US Capitol, forcing Washington into lockdown

Numerous media outlets named Babbitt, a 35-year-old San Diego woman, late Wednesday, and KSUI-TV quoted her husband saying she had been a staunch Trump supporter and ""a great patriot.""

Graphic videos of the shooting show Babbitt wore a Trump flag as a cape as she tried to crawl through a broken window, flanked by other protesters. A single shot rang out, and she fell to the floor bleeding from an apparent neck wound.

Police officers screamed for the crowd to make room and a voice heard on video declared, ""Ladies and gentlemen, a lady was just shot. She might be dying right now.""

Messages of grief and mourning poured out on social media after Babbitt’s identity was circulated.

The biographical section of a Twitter account with the user name, Ashli Babbitt, using the display name ""CommonAshSense,"" identifies her as a veteran, a Libertarian, and a Second Amendment supporter.

Online, she was vocal about her backing of Trump and appeared in photographs wearing a red ball cap with the president’s ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. In September, Babbitt tweeted a photo from a pro-Trump boat parade in San Diego.

On Jan. 1, she advised followers she would be in Washington, D.C., for the demonstration with a post that said, ""God bless America and WWG1WGA."" The initials, a slogan for the QAnon conspiracy network, stand for “Where we go one, we go all.”

On Tuesday, Babbitt posted a declaration: ""Nothing will stop us....they can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!""

That message was in response to a post from another Twitter user who pictured a colonial flag overlaid with ""1776 Again"" above the words, ""Trump is still our president.""

Babbitt’s account also shows many retweets. The last one, posted Wednesday, called for Vice President Mike Pence to resign and face charges of treason; for former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder and treason and for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to resign.

Members of Babbitt’s family could not be reached for comment Thursday.

Babbitt served in the Air Force under the married name of Ashli Elizabeth McEntee. She served as an enlisted airman in the Air Force, serving on active duty and in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, according to records released Thursday.

She worked as an active duty security forces airman, troops with law enforcement training who protect air bases in the United States and abroad. She served on active duty from April 2004 to April 2008 and deployed to Iraq, according to the records. She received several commendations, including for service in the Global War on Terrorism.

She was in the reserve from 2008 to 2010, and the guard from 2010 to 2016.

An undated news release from Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska pictured Airman Ashli McEntee with her then-husband, Sgt. 1st Class Timothy McEntee, after they had adopted her military working dog. Maryland records show the McEntees divorced in 2019.

A District of Columbia Air National Guard news release in 2014 listed Senior Airman Ashli McEntee among 30 personnel being sent to southwest Asia. The article noted it was her eighth deployment and identified her as a mentor to others in the 113th Security Forces Squadron.

California business records list Ashli Elizabeth McEntee as the owner of Fowler’s Pool Service & Supply, a San Diego County business. A LinkedIn account for Ashli McEntee indicates she took over the company in 2017. Customers praised Ashli and Aaron Babbitt online for their service.

Scotland enters another national lockdown

England headed back into lockdown. Mexico City’s hospitals hold more virus patients than ever. Germany reported one of its highest daily death tolls to date Tuesday. South Africa and Brazil are struggling to find space for the dead. Even pandemic success story Thailand is fighting an unexpected wave of infections.

And as doctors face or brace for rising numbers of COVID-19 patients after end-of-year holiday gatherings, more and more countries are reporting cases of a new, more contagious variant that has already swept across Britain.

January is going to be “a tough one,” said Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization. “This idea that seems to be ‘Ah, we’re all sick of it. We want to look at something else. Oh, this doesn’t apply to me’ ... that’s got to go away. It really is all hands on deck.”

While Britain rolled out a second vaccine this week and some U.S. states are starting to give the second round of shots, access to inoculations globally is sharply unequal. The supply isn’t remotely close to meeting the epic demand needed to vanquish a foe that has already killed more than 1.85 million.

“We are in a race to prevent infections, bring cases down, protect health systems and save lives while rolling out two highly effective and safe vaccines to high-risk populations,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “This is not easy. These are the hard miles.”

England is facing a third national lockdown that will last at least six weeks, as authorities struggle to stem a surge in COVID-19 infections and relieve hospitals, where some patients are left waiting in ambulances in a parking lot for access to overcrowded wards.

U.S. confirms 1st case of new COVID-19 strain found in UK

The U.S. could soon give at least 1 million COVID-19 vaccinations a day, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday, even as he warned of a dangerous next few weeks as the coronavirus surges.

The slow pace is frustrating health officials and a desperate public alike, with only about one-third of the first supplies shipped to states used as of Tuesday morning, just over three weeks into the vaccination campaign.

“Any time you start a big program, there’s always glitches. I think the glitches have been worked out,” Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told The Associated Press.

Vaccinations have already begun speeding up, reaching roughly half a million injections a day, he pointed out.

Now, with the holidays over, “once you get rolling and get some momentum, I think we can achieve 1 million a day or even more,” Fauci said. He called President-elect Joe Biden’s goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days “a very realistic, important, achievable goal.”

It’s an optimistic prediction considering the logistical hurdles facing states and counties as they struggle to administer rationed vaccine supplies amid rising COVID-19 hospitalizations. Fauci pointed to California’s swamped hospitals and exhausted workers even before holiday travel and family gatherings added fuel to the outbreak.

Fauci estimated that between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population will need to be vaccinated to achieve “herd immunity,” meaning enough people are protected that it’s difficult for the virus to continue spreading. That translates to as many as 280 million people.

He said he is hoping to achieve that by the start of next fall.

The coronavirus has killed more than 357,000 Americans, and the next few weeks could bring another jump in infections nationally that “could make matters even worse,” Fauci said.

The Trump administration had promised to provide states enough vaccine for 20 million people in December and fell short even as states struggled with their role — getting shots into people’s arms, starting mostly with health care workers and nursing home residents.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 4.8 million doses of more than 17 million delivered had been used by Tuesday morning. That is probably an undercount because of delays in reporting, but it is far fewer than experts had hoped.

The lawmaker, Derrick Evans, posted the video to his Facebook page, where he goes by “Derrick Evans - The Activist” on Wednesday afternoon, but he later deleted it.

Mr. Evans, who was elected as a Republican state delegate in November, posted several videos from the events of the day, both narrating and joining in “Stop the Steal” chants with throngs of other Trump supporters. In the video that was deleted, he is among a crowd that shoved up against a door at the Capitol’s east front, some chanting and others loudly singing the national anthem. Those at the front appear to be trying to get inside, while Mr. Evans gives a running commentary on the attempts.

“We’re going in,” he says, at one point turning the camera to show himself wearing a helmet.

Suddenly the crowd moves quickly and the crowd rushes in, one woman screaming “We did it!” and Mr. Evans shouting “Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Congress’ tally of the Electoral College vote won by Joe Biden (all times local):

3:55 a.m.

President Donald Trump now says there “will be an orderly transition on January 20th” after Congress concluded the electoral vote count certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory and after a day of violence when his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.

Trump says in a statement tweeted by his social media director Dan Scavino, “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.”

He adds: “I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again.”

Trump’s account is currently locked by Twitter.

Trump has spent the last two months refusing to concede the election and making baseless allegations of mass voter fraud that have been rejected by dozens of courts and Republican officials, including his former attorney general.

Vice President Mike Pence presided over the formal session that ended early Thursday morning tallying the electoral college vote.

HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CONGRESS’ TALLY OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE

Angry supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in a chaotic protest aimed at thwarting a peaceful transfer of power, forcing lawmakers to be rushed from the building and interrupting challenges to Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Congress returned later Wednesday to resume their proceedings after the Capitol was cleared by law enforcement.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON:

3:41 a.m.

Congress has formally validated Joe Biden’s presidential election victory on a day that saw a time-honored ceremony become a nightmare of unprecedented political terror.

The House and Senate certified the Democrat’s electoral college win early Thursday after a violent throng of pro-Trump rioters spent hours Wednesday running rampant through the Capitol. A woman was fatally shot, windows were bashed and the mob forced shaken lawmakers and aides to flee the building, shielded by Capitol Police.

The rampage began shortly after President Donald Trump repeated his unfounded claims of election fraud to thousands of rallying demonstrators he’d invited to Washington. Many then surged to the Capitol after he incited them to go there as lawmakers debated the electoral votes.

More than six hours after the violence erupted, lawmakers resumed their session.

Thirteen Republican senators and dozens of GOP representatives had planned to force debate and votes on perhaps six different states’ votes.

The assault on the Capitol made some Republicans squeamish about trying to overturn Biden’s win, and challenges were lodged only against Arizona and Pennsylvania. Both efforts lost overwhelmingly.

Biden defeated Trump by 306-232 electoral votes and will be inaugurated Jan. 20.

3:25 a.m.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is defending his objection to the Electoral College results as “the right thing to do.”

The Texas senator condemned the violence that erupted as supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in an extraordinary attack over the election outcome.

Cruz led the first challenge to Joe Biden’s defeat of President Donald Trump by objecting to Arizona’s results. He sought to have Congress launch a commission to investigate the election. His effort was roundly defeated in the House and Senate.

Cruz said he was confident the country will have a “peaceful and orderly transition of power.” Biden is set to be inaugurated Jan. 20.

3:10 a.m.

The House has joined the Senate in turning aside Republican objections to Pennsylvania’s electoral vote for President-elect Joe Biden.

Lawmakers in the House voted 282-138 against the objection as the counting of Electoral College votes continued into the early hours of Thursday morning. The Senate shut down the same objection 92-7 just after midnight, and unlike the House, declined to debate before voting.

After a long day dominated by pro-Trump rioters’ deadly storming of the Capitol, it was the second state for which a group of Republicans tried and failed to reverse the will of voters. Some GOP lawmakers have backed President Donald Trump’s bogus claims that the election was fraudulent.

Those objecting to Pennsylvania’s votes included 80 House Republicans and Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who is considered a potential 2024 presidential contender.

__

2:20 a.m.

A small group of House lawmakers came close to physically fighting early Thursday morning as the congressional count of electoral votes stretched into the wee hours and a Pennsylvania Democrat charged that Republicans had been telling “lies” about his state’s votes.

Rep. Morgan Griffiths, R-Va., objected after Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., said a breach of the Capitol by an angry mob earlier in the day was “inspired by lies, the same lies you are hearing in this room tonight.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shot down the objection, but a few minutes later Republicans and Democrats streamed to the middle aisle, with around a dozen lawmakers getting close to each other and arguing. But the group quickly broke up when Pelosi called for order on the floor.

President Donald Trump has falsely claimed there was widespread fraud in Pennsylvania and other states and Republicans have echoed those claims as they have challenged electoral votes.

__

12:55 a.m.

The Senate has quickly killed Republican objections to Pennsylvania’s electoral vote for President-elect Joe Biden.

Senators voted 92-7 after midnight to derail the GOP attempt to overturn Pennsylvania’s support for the Democrat.

In a long day dominated by pro-Trump rioters’ deadly storming of the Capitol, it’s the second state for which a group of Republicans tried and failed to reverse the will of voters. Some GOP lawmakers have backed President Donald Trump’s bogus claims that the election was fraudulent.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he believes no other states’ votes will be challenged. That means Congress’ formal certification of Biden’s victory could finish quickly once the House votes on the Pennsylvania challenge.

The Senate rejected the effort to cancel Pennsylvania’s votes without any debate.

Those objecting to Pennsylvania’s votes included 80 House Republicans and Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who is considered a potential 2024 presidential contender.

___

12:15 a.m. Thursday

Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have objected to the counting of Pennsylvania’s electoral votes, triggering up to two hours of debate in the House and Senate.

The objections come 11 hours after the congressional count to confirm Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential victory began, and after lawmakers had to evacuate both chambers for several hours to escape a mob that had violently breached the Capitol.

Hawley said last week that he would object to Pennsylvania’s electoral votes, saying Congress should investigate voter fraud. President Donald Trump has falsely said since his defeat that there was widespread fraud in the election.

Biden won Pennsylvania by just over 80,000 votes. Since the Nov. 3 election, Trump and his allies filed at least a half-dozen lawsuits challenging Biden’s win on various grounds, including that many or all of the state’s mail-in ballots were illegal.

The lawsuits failed as judge after judge found no violation of state law or constitutional rights, or no grounds to grant an immediate halt to certifying the election.

___

11:20 p.m.

The House has voted overwhelmingly to reject an objection to President-elect Joe Biden’s win in Arizona, joining the Senate in upholding the results of the election there.

The objection failed 303-121 on Wednesday night, with only Republicans voting in support.

Earlier Wednesday, supporters of President Donald Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, forcing a lockdown of the lawmakers and staff inside. Trump has claimed widespread voter fraud to explain away his defeat to Biden, though election officials have said there wasn’t any.

Now that Arizona is out of the way, Congress will reconvene as the joint session and make its way through the rest of the states that have objections.

11:10 p.m.

Four people died as supporters of President Donald Trump violently occupied the U.S. Capitol.

Washington, D.C., Police Chief Robert Contee said the dead on Wednesday included a woman who was shot by the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as three others who died in “medical emergencies.”

Police said both law enforcement and Trump supporters deployed chemical irritants during the hourslong occupation of the Capitol building before it was cleared Wednesday evening by law enforcement.

The woman was shot earlier Wednesday as the mob tried to break through a barricaded door in the Capitol where police were armed on the other side. She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died.

D.C. police officials also say two pipe bombs were recovered, one outside the Democratic National Committee and one outside the Republican National Committee. Police found a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds.

10:15 p.m.

The Senate has overwhelmingly turned aside a challenge to President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in Arizona, guaranteeing the result will stand.

The objection to the results in Arizona -- spearheaded by Rep. Paul Gosar and Sen. Ted Cruz -- was rejected 93-6 on Wednesday night. All votes in favor came from Republicans, but after violent protesters mobbed the Capitol earlier Wednesday a number of GOP senators who had planned to support the objection reversed course.

The Republicans raised the objection based on false claims pushed by President Donald Trump and others of issues with the vote in Arizona, which were repeatedly dismissed in Arizona’s courts and by the state’s election officials.

10:10 p.m.

Sen. Lindsey Graham says a commission to examine the 2020 election is not a proper next step and affirmed that Joe Biden is the “legitimate president of the United States.”

Graham, a South Carolina Republican and longtime ally of President Donald Trump, called it a “uniquely bad idea to delay this election,” referencing the commission idea proposed by his fellow South Carolina Republican, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott.

Graham says, “Count me out. Enough is enough.”

Earlier Wednesday, supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol, forcing a lockdown of the lawmakers and staff inside. Trump has claimed widespread voter fraud to explain away his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, though election officials have said there wasn’t any.

Graham said that “if you’re a conservative,” the idea that Vice President Mike Pence could reverse the results of the election, as President Donald Trump had urged him to do, was “the most offensive concept in the world.”

Police have arrested 30 people for violating a curfew imposed in Washington, D.C., after rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol.

Officials say the 30 people were arrested Wednesday evening after being found on the streets after the 6 p.m.

The curfew had been imposed after scores of supporters of President Donald Trump broke into the Capitol, halting the constitutional process of voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win. They were later forcibly removed from the Capitol.

The Metropolitan Police Department said 15 other people had been arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday in various protest-related arrests on an array of charges, including weapons possession and assault.

Fire officials also took 13 people to area hospitals on Wednesday from protest-related injuries.

___

9:55 p.m.

Republican Sen. Josh Hawley says he is going forward with his objection to the Electoral College results in Pennsylvania despite the violent breach at the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump.

The Missouri senator said he did not support violence but said the Senate should go forward with a legal process that includes his objections.

Hawley says his objections should be debated “peacefully, without violence, without attacks, without bullets.” He says he hoped lawmakers would not brush his concerns aside because of the violence earlier Wednesday, including the death of a protester inside the Capitol.

Trump has claimed widespread voter fraud to explain away his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden, though election officials have said there wasn’t any.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is comparing violence at the U.S. Capitol to protests against racial injustice over the summer after the killing of George Floyd by police.

The U.S. Capitol was overrun by a mob supportive of President Donald Trump on Wednesday as Congress counted electoral votes to confirm President-elect Joe Biden’s win. Trump has falsely said there was widespread fraud in the election to explain his defeat and encouraged his supporters to come to Washington.

McCarthy said, “Mobs don’t rule America. Laws rule America. It was true when our cities were burning this summer and it is true now.”

The comment got loud applause from Republicans. Democrats in the chamber sat silently.

Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, was killed in May after a white police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he said he couldn’t breathe.

McCarthy, an ally of Trump’s, said Wednesday was the “saddest day” he’s ever had in Congress.

He said: “It is clear this Congress will not be the same after today.”

___

9:15 p.m.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Congress’ certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s election win will show the world it won’t back down.

Pelosi made her comments as the House reconvened after being shut down for hours Wednesday by unruly pro-Trump protesters. She said that every four years the ritual provides an example to the world of American democracy.

Pelosi says, “Despite the shameful actions of today, we will still do so, we will be part of a history that shows the world what America is made of.”

Pelosi, a Roman Catholic, noted that Wednesday is the feast of the Epiphany and prayed that the violence would be “an epiphany to heal” for the country.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is sending 1,000 members of the state’s National Guard to Washington, D.C., to help “the peaceful transition of presidential power.”

Cuomo, a Democrat, said 1,000 troops would be sent for up to two weeks at the request of U.S. National Guard officials. It comes after a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters rampaged through the U.S. Capitol.

Cuomo said in a statement Wednesday: “For 244 years, the cornerstone of our democracy has been the peaceful transfer of power, and New York stands ready to help ensure the will of the American people is carried out, safely and decisively.”

They will join law enforcement from Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey who are also coming to D.C.’s aid.

The president’s supporters incited chaos in a protest over a transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden. Trump convinced them that he was cheated out of a victory by rampant, widespread voter fraud, a false claim.

___

8:55 p.m.

Multiple Republican senators have reversed course and now say they won’t object to congressional certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.

Their change of heart came after a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol earlier Wednesday and interrupted their proceedings. One person was fatally shot.

Sens. Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Braun of Indiana and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia all said in light of the violence they would stand down from planned objections to Biden’s win.

Lawmakers gathered to certify the Electoral College votes from each state were forced to evacuate after an angry mob of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol. Loeffler said that the “violence, the lawlessness, and siege of the halls of Congress” were a “direct attack” on the “sanctity of the American democratic process.”

All three had previously signed on to Trump’s false claims of widespread voter fraud to explain his defeat. Loeffler has just days left in her term. She lost her Senate race to Democrat Raphael Warnock earlier Wednesday.

8:45 p.m.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says Congress “will not be deterred” in confirming the results of the presidential election hours after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol.

The Republican leader reopened the Senate late Wednesday vowing to finish confirming the Electoral College for President-elect Joe Biden. It was interrupted earlier in the way when rioters breached the security perimeter and clashed with law enforcement before disrupting Congress’ tallying of the Electoral College votes. One person was fatally shot.

McConnell says demonstrators “tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed.”

McConnell plans to keep the Senate in session Wednesday to finish confirming the results.

Trump has repeatedly told his supporters that the November election was stolen from him, even though that is not true. He reiterated the claim in a video filmed as his demonstrators were storming the Capitol.

___

8:35 p.m.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says President Donald Trump “bears a great deal of the blame” after a mob loyal to him stormed the U.S. Capitol.

As the Senate reconvened to count electoral votes that will confirm Democrat Joe Biden’s win, Schumer said that Jan. 6, 2021, will “live forever in infamy” and will be a stain on the democracy.

Schumer said the events “did not happen spontaneously.”

He said Wednesday: “The president, who promoted conspiracy theories that motivated these thugs, the president, who exhorted them to come to our nation’s capital, egged them on.”

Trump has falsely claimed that there was widespread fraud in the election to explain away his defeat.

Schumer says the protesters should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

8:20 p.m.

Former President Barack Obama says history will rightly remember the violence at the Capitol as a moment of great dishonor and shame for the nation.

Angry supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in a chaotic protest aimed at thwarting a peaceful transfer of power.

Obama say the violence was “incited by a sitting president” who baselessly lied about the outcome of the presidential election. He has convinced his supporters that he lost the election to President-elect Joe Biden only because Democrats cheated, a false claim.

Obama says it should not have come as a surprise, and that for two months “a political party and its accompanying media ecosystem has too often been unwilling to tell their followers the truth.”

He says “their fantasy narrative has spiraled further and further from reality, and it builds upon years of sown resentments. Now we’re seeing the consequences, whipped up into a violent crescendo.”

___

8:10 p.m.

The Senate has resumed debating the Republican challenge against Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory, more than six hours after pro-Trump mobs attacked the Capitol and forced lawmakers to flee.

Scores of Republican representatives and 13 GOP senators had planned to object Wednesday to the electoral votes of perhaps six states that backed Biden. It was unclear whether those objections would continue in light of the day’s violent events.

President Donald Trump has falsely insisted that the election was marred by fraud and that he actually won. He reiterated those claims in remarks to thousands of protesters outside the White House early Wednesday and goaded them to march to the Capitol, which many of them did.

The mayhem had forced the House and Senate to abruptly end the day’s debates and flee to safety under the protection of police. And it prompted bipartisan outrage as many lawmakers blamed Trump for fostering the violence.

___

8:05 p.m.

Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned in protest over President Donald Trump’s Syria policies, blamed the president for the violence at the U.S. Capitol.

In a sharp rebuke Wednesday, Mattis said the violence was fomented by Trump, who has used the presidency “to destroy trust in our election and to poison our respect for fellow citizens.”

His written statement concluded, “Our Constitution and our Republic will overcome this stain and We the People will come together again in our never-ending effort to form a more perfect Union, while Mr. Trump will deservedly be left a man without a country.”

Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general who stepped down as Pentagon chief in December 2018, had an embattled relationship with Trump, but largely remained publicly quiet and avoided direct criticism. Since he left the job, however, he has been more openly derisive of Trump, including a pubilc condemnation of the president’s heavy-handed use of military force to quell protests near the White House last June.

7:55 p.m.

Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff and press secretary for first lady Melania Trump, has resigned following violent protests at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump.

Grisham says in a statement Wednesday that it was an “honor” to serve the country in the White House and be part of he first lady’s “mission” to help children.

Grisham was one of Trump’s longest serving aides, having joined the campaign in 2015. She served as the White House press secretary and never held a press briefing.

Wednesday’s violent occupation of the U.S. Capitol by the president’s supporters sparked renewed conversations inside the White House about mass resignations by mid-level aides who are responsible for operations of the office of the president.

Two people familiar with the conversations said the aides were torn between fears of what more would happen if they left and a desire to register their disgust with their boss. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

The Republican National Committee says it strongly condemns the violence at the Capitol, adding that the violent scenes “do not represent acts of patriotism, but an attack on our country and its founding principles.”

The RNC is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform. Its statement condemning the violence came hours after Republican President Donald Trump baselessly complained that the election was stripped away “from great patriots.” He went on to tell them to “go home with love & in peace.”

The group’s communications director, Michael Ahrens, says, “What happened today was domestic terrorism.”

He says to see the U.S. flag used “in the name of unfounded conspiracy theories is a disgrace to the nation, and every decent American should be disgusted by it.”

Trump had encouraged his supporters to come to Washington to fight Congress’ formal approval of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over him, citing false claims of voter fraud. He held a rally earlier Wednesday and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, telling them to “get rid of the weak Congress people.”

Former President Bill Clinton says the attack on the U.S. Capitol was fueled over four years of “poison politics” and lit by President Donald Trump.

Clinton said in a statement Wednesday night that the riot at the Capitol resulted from a combination of deliberate disinformation that created distrust in the system and pit Americans against one another.

He wrote, “The match was lit by Donald Trump and his most ardent enablers, including many in Congress, to overturn the results of an election he lost.”

His wife, Hillary Clinton, lost a bitter election to Trump in 2016 and conceded to him immediately. Trump has refused to accept his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden in November and is trying to cast him as an illegitimate president.

Trump had encouraged his supporters to come to Washington to fight Congress’ formal approval of Biden’s win. He held a rally earlier Wednesday and urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, telling them to “get rid of the weak Congress people” and saying, “get the weak ones get out; this is the time for strength.”

A West Virginia lawmaker took video of himself and other supporters of President Donald Trump rushing into the U.S. Capitol after they breached the security perimeter.

In the video by Republican Del. Derrick Evans, later deleted from his social media page, he is shown wearing a helmet and clamoring at the door to breach the building in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.

“We’re in! Keep it moving, baby!” he said in a packed doorway amid Trump followers holding flags and complaining of being pepper sprayed. Once inside, Evans could be seen on video milling around the Capitol Rotunda, where historical paintings depict the republic’s founding, and yelled, “No vandalizing!”

State House of Delegates Speaker Roger Hanshaw said Evans will need to “answer to his constituents and colleagues regarding his involvement in what has occurred today.”

He said he has not spoken to Evans yet about his involvement.

The delegate from Wayne County said in a statement later on Facebook that he was heading back to West Virginia and “was simply there as an independent member of the media to film history.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Congress will resume the Electoral College proceedings once the Capitol is cleared of pro-Donald Trump protesters and safe for use.

Pelosi said she made the decision Wednesday in consultation with the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the vice president, who will preside.

She noted the day would always be “part of history,” but now it would be “as such a shameful picture of our country was put out into the world.”

Trump had encouraged his supporters to come to Washington to fight Congress’ formal approval of President-elect Joe Biden’s win.

Dozens of pro-Trump protesters remain on the streets of the nation’s capital in defiance of the curfew imposed after rioters stormed the Capitol.

The mostly maskless crowd was forcibly removed from the Capitol on Wednesday after breaking into the building and halting the constitutional process of voting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win. They were pushed out of the immediate area and moved down the hill, where they taunted law enforcement and moved barricades.

Police said anyone found on the streets after the 6 p.m. curfew would be arrested. Officers in full riot gear with shields lined the streets near the U.S. Capitol.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said their debate on affirming Biden’s victory would continue after the Capitol was secured.

The head of the nation’s largest union of flight attendants says people who took part in the violent protest at the Capitol must be banned from flying.

Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said in a statement Wednesday that “some of the people who traveled in our planes (Tuesday) participated in the insurrection at the Capitol today.”

She says, “Their violent and seditious actions at the Capitol today create further concern about their departure from the DC area. Acts against our democracy, our government and the freedom we claim as Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight.”

Nelson and the union endorsed President-elect Joe Biden over President Donald Trump before the November election.

Trump supporters on a Delta Air Lines flight from Salt Lake City to Washington heckled Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the lone Republican senator to vote to oust Trump after he was impeached. On an American Airlines flight from Dallas, a large contingent of Trump supporters got in an angry yelling match with other passengers after one of the president’s supporters projected “Trump 2020” on the cabin ceiling and walls.

6:30 p.m.

Republican Sen. Mitt Romney is blaming President Donald Trump for inciting a violent “insurrection” at the Capitol.

Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee and a frequent critic of Trump’s, said the violent breach of the Capitol on Wednesday was “due to a selfish man’s injured pride and the outrage of his supporters whom he has deliberately misinformed for the past two months.″

The Utah senator said those who continue to support Trump’s “dangerous gambit” by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election “will forever be seen as complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy.″

Romney ridiculed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and other Republicans who want an “audit” of the election results: “Please! No Congressional led audit will ever convince those voters, particularly when the president will continue to claim the election was stolen.”

The simple truth, Romney said, “is that President-elect (Joe) Biden won this election. President Trump lost.″

President Donald Trump has appeared to justify the violent occupation of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.

In a tweet Wednesday night, Trump said, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.”

He added, “Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”

Trump supporters breached the Capitol building and clashed with law enforcement before disrupting Congress’ tallying of the Electoral College votes. Trump has repeatedly told his supporters that the November election was stolen from him, even though that is not true.

Trump has faced mounting criticism from Republican lawmakers to do more to condemn the violence being perpetrated in his name."
Twitter Locks Trump’s Account After Violence on Capitol Hill,34,ks1cyq,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/technology/violence-election-capitol-hill-social-media.html,10,1610008533.0,,"On Twitter on Wednesday, users called for the company’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, to take down President Trump’s account. Civil rights groups said action by social media companies against calls for political violence was “long overdue.” Even venture capitalists who had reaped riches from investing in social media urged Twitter and Facebook to do more.

“For four years you’ve rationalized this terror. Inciting violent treason is not a free speech exercise,” Chris Sacca, a tech investor who had invested in Twitter, wrote to Mr. Dorsey and Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. “If you work at those companies, it’s on you too. Shut it down.”

Twitter, Facebook and others had previously resisted cracking down on Mr. Trump’s posts and other toxic content, saying that the posts were in the public’s interest. While the platforms had started taking more steps against political misinformation in the months before the election, they declined to remove Mr. Trump’s messages and instead took half measures, such as labeling his posts.

So when violence broke out in Washington on Wednesday, it was, in the minds of longtime critics, the day the chickens came home to roost for the social media companies. After the onslaught of criticism began, Twitter and Facebook started removing several of Mr. Trump’s posts from their sites, including one where the president falsely said that “a sacred landslide election victory” had been “unceremoniously & viciously stripped away.”

“We know the social media companies have been lackadaisical at best” at stopping extremism from growing on their platforms, said Jonathan Greenblatt, director of the Anti-Defamation League. “Freedom of expression is not the freedom to incite violence. That is not protected speech.”

Renee DiResta, a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory who studies online movements, added that the violence was the result of people operating in closed social media networks where they believed the claims of voter fraud and of the election being stolen from Mr. Trump.

“This is a demonstration of the very real-world impact of echo chambers,” she said. “This has been a striking repudiation of the idea that there is an online and an offline world, and that what is said online is in some way kept online. I hope that this eliminates the conception from people’s minds.”"

Jon Ossoff unseated incumbent Republican David Perdue and Raphael Warnock defeated appointed GOP Senator Kelly Loeffler in Tuesday’s special election, according to the Associated Press. Neither Republican had won a majority on Nov. 3, forcing the runoffs two months later.

The race call came amid chaos in the nation’s capitol as supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol and disrupted lawmakers who were meeting to certify the November election for President-elect Joe Biden.

The double win marked a final setback for Trump in his efforts to turn the election his way, including his urging protesters to “cheer on” those challenging the election, and only telling them to retreat after they broke windows in the Capitol and forced members of Congress to barricade in the chamber.

Republicans said his challenge of the election results had cost the party two Senate seats.

“It turns out that telling the voters that the election is rigged is not a great way to turn out your voters,” said Utah Senator Mitt Romney, a longtime Trump antagonist.

North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer said Trump’s message wasn’t “helpful” for turnout, but he also noted that his party should have noticed Georgia’s politics were changing.

“We didn’t just wake up to that, obviously,” he said. “Senator Perdue has sounded that alarm for at least two years.”

Turnout in Republican counties didn’t match the enthusiasm among urban, suburban and Black Democrats who turned out in greater numbers even than in November.

The Democrats’ victory means a 50-50 split between Republicans and the Democratic caucus, with incoming Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes and conferring control of the chamber.

In a tweet, Biden said he called Warnock and Ossoff on Wednesday morning “to congratulate them on their hard-fought campaigns. Georgia voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: They want action on the crises we face and they want it right now.”

Biden’s party will hold the gavels in both the House and Senate, with the first Democratic trifecta, including the White House, in a decade. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York is set to become majority leader, reducing the scope of Republican leader Mitch McConnell to stymie Biden’s agenda and personnel picks.

The victories by Ossoff and Warnock, who will be the first Black U.S. senator from Georgia, were propelled by record turnouts in the Southern state and mark a major shift in Georgia politics. That follows Biden’s narrow win there in November -- the first time Georgia voted for a Democratic president since 1992.

Nearly half of the state’s votes come from the Atlanta metropolitan region, and Democrats have been gaining in the diverse, fast-growing suburbs that ring the city. Stacey Abrams, a Democrat, had come tantalizingly close to winning the governorship in 2018, and much of that campaign infrastructure remained in place.

While Biden can now escape a blizzard of subpoenas from Republican Senate committee chairs intent on digging further into his son Hunter Biden’s financial dealings, the narrow margin of Senate control will limit Democrats’ ability to deliver on the most ambitious agenda items.

Centrist Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has already pledged to oppose any effort to abolish the filibuster, a requirement for 60 votes to proceed with most legislation. Unless he and other Democratic skeptics of ending the practice change their minds, Biden would have to rely on special budget rules that allow only certain spending, tax and debt limit bills to pass with a simple majority.

Biden and Schumer will have to manage a Senate that has an energized liberal wing including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont along with more moderate figures like Manchin and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who saw her Democratic majority narrowed in November’s election, similarly has to balance the initiatives of progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York with those of the moderates who will be facing voters again in November 2022.

“There’s a real progressive-establishment divide in the party,” said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute.

Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida, co-chair of the Blue Dog Coalition, cautioned that the Democrats’ majority makers mostly come from swing districts and tend to be more moderate. Blue Dogs were a key brake on President Barack Obama’s agenda in his first two years, insisting on a pay-as-you-go law in an effort to keep the lid on the deficit.

As in 2009, the battle for another economic relief package will provide an early test, though back then Democrats had far larger majorities in both chambers.

Budget-related legislation using so-called reconciliation rules could be used as vehicles for other Democratic priorities, like a public health care option for the Affordable Care Act, climate measures and a progressive rewrite of the tax code.

Yet many other agenda items, such as gun-control measures, federal codes for voting rights, higher minimum wages and new family-leave regulations, would likely fall by the wayside with the filibuster intact.

Democrats will also be under pressure to deliver finally on a comprehensive immigration overhaul after decades of false starts, with the scope and shape of such a bill dependent in large part on whether they need Republican votes.

Rep. Ilhan Omar drawing up articles of impeachment for Trump,136,krzfyg,https://www.fox9.com/news/rep-ilhan-omar-drawing-up-articles-of-impeachment-for-trump,60,1610002668.0,,"article

Rep. Ilhan Omar says she is writing articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump after a large mob of his supporters breached the U.S. Capitol Wednesday.

In a tweet, Omar said Trump ""should be impeached by the House of Representatives & removed from office by the United States Senate.""

Omar called the events of Wednesday a ""coup attempt"" and called the rioters ""armed terrorists.""

""We can’t allow him to remain in office,"" she said in the tweet. ""It’s a matter of preserving our Republic and we need to fulfill our oath.""

Omar went on to say, ""All leaders should denounce this coup. And the President should be impeached and removed from office for his open sedition.""

The rioters breached the Capitol after a rally led by President Trump earlier in the day Wednesday, where he disputed the outcome of the election and called for his supporters to march to the Capitol to protest Congress's certification of the Presidential election results. Later Wednesday, he called for an end to the violence while calling the rioters ""special"" people.

The President’s term ends in 14 days. The President was impeached but not removed about one year ago."
Pro-Trump mob storms US Capitol as armed standoff takes place outside House chamber,57,krwhu0,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html,11,1609993875.0,,"(CNN) The US Capitol is once again secured but four people are dead -- including one woman who was shot -- after supporters of President Donald Trump breached one of the most iconic American buildings, engulfing the nation's capital in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that will confirm President-elect Joe Biden's win.

Shortly after 1 p.m. ET Wednesday hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers ""traitors"" for doing their jobs. About 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, where he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.

An armed standoff took place at the House front door at about 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon.

A woman, who is yet to be identified, died after being shot in the chest on the Capitol grounds, DC police confirmed to CNN. More information on the shooting was not immediately available and a police spokesperson said additional details will come later. DC Police Chief Robert Contee said three other people died from medical emergencies during the riot.

""One adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths. Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss,"" Contee said at a news conference Wednesday night.

Multiple officers have been injured with at least one transported to the hospital, multiple sources tell CNN.

Smoke grenades were used on the Senate side of the Capitol, as police worked to clear the building of rioters. Windows on the west side of the Senate were broken, and hundreds of officers amassed on the first floor of the building.

The Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and toward the Rotunda. The protesters were removed through the east and west doors of the Capitol. At least 52 people were arrested as of 9:30 p.m. ET Wednesday in Washington.

The US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first, and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building. With about 30 minutes to go before Washington's 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds.

It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.

The stunning display of insurrection was the first time the US Capitol had been overrun since the British attacked and burned the building in August of 1814, during the War of 1812, according to Samuel Holliday, director of scholarship and operations with the US Capitol Historical Society.

The shocking scene was met with less police force than many of the Black Lives Matter protests that rolled across the country in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last year. While federal police attacked peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square outside the White House over the summer, clearing the way for Trump to take a photo in front of a nearby church at the time, protesters on Wednesday were able to overrun Capitol police and infiltrate the country's legislative chambers.

An afternoon of chaos

The protesters first breached exterior security barriers, and video footage showed protesters gathering and some clashing with police near the Capitol building. CNN's team on the ground saw a number of protesters trying to move up the side of the Capitol building. Several loud flash bangs were heard as well.

Protesters could be seen pushing against metal fences and police used the fences to push protesters back, while other officers reached over the top to club people trying to cross their lines.

Flash bangs could be heard near the steps of the Capitol as smoke filled the air. In some instances officers could be seen deploying pepper spray. Tear gas was deployed, but it's not clear whether by protesters or police, and people wiped tears from their eyes while coughing.

After the building was breached, the Capitol police officer in the House chamber told lawmakers that they may need to duck under their chairs and informed lawmakers that protesters were in the building's Rotunda. Lots of House members were seen wearing gas masks as they moved between Capitol buildings. Members were calling family to say they were OK.

Congressional leaders were being evacuated from the Capitol complex just before 5 p.m. ET and were set to be taken to Fort McNair, a nearby Army base in Washington, according to a federal law enforcement official.

Trump has directed the National Guard to Washington along with ""other federal protective services,"" according to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. The entire DC National Guard has been activated by the Department of Defense, according to the Pentagon.

""The D.C. Guard has been mobilized to provide support to federal law enforcement in the District,"" said Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman. ""Acting Secretary Miller has been in contact with Congressional leadership, and Secretary McCarthy has been working with the D.C. government. The law enforcement response will be led by the Department of Justice.""

The official said DC National Guard was not anticipating to be used to protect federal facilities, and the Trump administration had decided earlier this week that would be the task of civilian law enforcement, the official said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. ET on Wednesday until 6 a.m. ET Thursday.

Lawmakers return to the Capitol

Lawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business -- namely, confirming Biden's win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.

Proceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence -- who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary -- bringing the Senate session back into order.

""Let's get back to work,"" he said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier Wednesday evening that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session Wednesday night.

""Today, a shameful assault was made on our democracy. It was anointed at the highest level of government. It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden,"" Pelosi wrote.

""To that end, in consultation with Leader Hoyer and Whip Clyburn and after calls to the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the Vice President, we have decided we should proceed tonight at the Capitol once it is cleared for use. Leader Hoyer will be sending out more guidance later today.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the ""United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.""

It took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning, but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden's election win.

Trump tells supporters to go home, eventually

Trump finally called on his supporters to ""go home"" hours after the riot started, but spent a large amount of time in the one-minute video lamenting and lying about his election loss.

In one stunning line, Trump told the mob to ""go home,"" but added, ""We love you. You are very special.""

Trump struck a sympathetic tone to the rioters he himself unleashed, saying, ""I know your pain, I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.""

However, later on in the evening Trump justified the mob's actions and praised them.

""These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!"" he said , in a tweet that was later deleted by Twitter.

Others inside the President's orbit tweeted their calls for calm as the mob repeatedly attempted to take over the building.

Donald Trump Jr., the President's son, said that his supporters who mobbed the Capitol were ""wrong and not who we are.""

""Be peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don't start acting like the other side. We have a country to save and this doesn't help anyone,"" he tweeted.

Multiple bombs detonated safely

Federal and local law enforcement responded to reports of possible pipe bombs in multiple locations in Washington, DC, according to a federal law enforcement official.

A pipe bomb was found at the Republican National Committee's headquarters, a RNC official told CNN. The device was found on the ground outside, along the wall of the headquarters. It was safely detonated by the police, the RNC official said.

At least two suspected pipe bombs were rendered safe by law enforcement -- the one at the building that houses RNC offices and one in the US Capitol complex, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. The official said these were real explosive devices and they were detonated safely.

The Democratic National Committee was also evacuated after a suspicious package was being investigated nearby, a Democratic source familiar with the matter told CNN. The party had preemptively closed the building ahead of the protests, the source said, but a few security and essential personnel were evacuated.

Near the scene where one of the pipe bombs was found Wednesday, police detained a suspect and found a vehicle with a rifle and as many as 10 Molotov cocktails, according to a federal law enforcement official. Investigators are working to determine whether there's a connection to the bombs found earlier.

President Donald Trump incited his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday where they ransacked the temple of American democracy in a violent crescendo to Trump’s coup failed attempt that led to the deaths of four people, authorities said. The mob at one point occupied the floor of the Senate and threatened to break into the House chamber, held back by a barricaded door and guards with pistols drawn.

The stunning attack began around 1 p.m. while Congress convened to certify Joe Biden’s election as president — an effort met with opposition from many Republicans. Around that time, during a speech outside the White House, Trump called on his supporters to head to the Capitol and protest the certification. They followed his command, posting on Gab and Parler “directions on which streets to take to avoid the police and which tools to bring to help pry open doors,” according to the New York Times. Meanwhile, a group of thousands on the western expose of the Capitol crashed through metal barriers and stormed up the steps where they quickly overwhelmed Capitol Police. Law enforcement deployed a minimally visible presence to avoid inflaming tensions, the Wall Street Journal reported. It didn’t work: The mob surged inside, then fanned out throughout the building.

Capitol Police said an officer shot and killed one rioter, who was seen on video with a group trying to break into the entryway to the House chamber. Three other people died of unspecified “medical emergencies,” authorities said. Fourteen police officers sustained injuries.

The certification vote was halted, and senators were rushed to an undisclosed location for their protection, reminiscent of the chaos on 9/11. A quick-thinking staffer snatched the box holding the Electoral College certificates. Pence, who presided over the session, was also swept to an undisclosed location. Meanwhile, in the House, representatives sheltered inside their chamber. The lawmakers were told to put on gas masks and hide under their seats if necessary.

Representative Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee, told Intelligencer he had been perched in the House gallery when invaders broke in and put on a gas mask there before retreating to his office, where he had a “baseball bat at the ready if the sons of bitches come in.” Before leaving, he shouted down to Republicans on the floor, “Somebody call Trump and tell him to call his revolutionary guards off.” Cohen said he was shocked at the treatment of the mob, which stormed the building, and the seeming impunity with which its members were allowed to behave. “All of these people are still hanging out in the Capitol. They ought to be arrested. If they were Black, they’d be shot.”

By 5 p.m., local and federal law enforcement reinforced the overwhelmed Capitol Police and began to slowly retake the grounds. By midnight, the toll of arrests reached into the dozens: some for weapons violations, many more for breaking the 6 p.m. curfew. Suspected bombs were found at the respective headquarters of the Republican and Democratic parties, according to the Washington Post. Protesters were seen trickling away as law enforcement finally convened.

The chaos on Capitol Hill extended to the White House. Pence approved the order to deploy the D.C. National Guard, according to the New York Times — and it’s unclear why Trump, the commander-in-chief, did not. Trump was unheard from during the first hour of the attack, then he issued a pair of limp tweets calling on the mob, which had already assaulted police, to be peaceful. More than three hours after it started, Trump finally released a video statement in which he called on the mob to go home — but after he said he loved them and repeated his false accusation that the election had been stolen. Twitter subsequently removed two tweets that said as much, locked his account for 12 hours, and threatened to ban him if he continues spouting misinformation. By nightfall, murmurs began of impeaching Trump again or using the 25th Amendment to remove him from office before his term ends on January 20.

Biden called it a dark moment in American history. “At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault, unlike anything we’ve seen in modern times,” he said. “The scenes of chaos at the capitol do not reflect the true America, do not represent who we are. What we’re seeing is a small number of extremists, dedicated to lawlessness. It’s not dissent, it’s disorder, it’s chaos. It borders on sedition and it must end — now.”

Representative Jake Auchincloss, a Democrat from Massachusetts, told Intelligencer the GOP had practically encouraged the mob by signing on to the effort to challenge Biden’s certification. “I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and that’s what I came to work on Wednesday intending to do, and it is gravely disappointing to me that there is a subset of Republicans in both chambers who could take that oath on Sunday too and could ignore it and undermine it on Wednesday.” Auchincloss, who saw combat in Afghanistan as a Marine, said that “nothing is going to stop me from walking back into the House chamber to certify the election. I’ll put on my old body armor if I need to.”

Pro-Trump rally speaker encourages attendees to hug and create ‘mass spreader event’,49,kroj1a,https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/pro-trump-rally-speaker-encourages-attendees-to-hug-and-create-mass-spreader-event/ar-BB1cv0Db,10,1609970895.0,,"Supporters of President Donald Trump have gathered in Washington DC for multiple rallies just one day before Congress is expected to officially certify the presidential election results.

One speaker for a Tuesday rally, which was held in Freedom Plaza, encouraged attendees to all hug each other – a suggestion that went against current coronavirus guidelines.

“Turn to the person next to you and give them a hug, someone you don’t know. Go hug somebody. Go ahead and spread it out, mass spreader,” he said, before chanting “mass-spreader event” multiple times to the crowd.

Attendees, many of whom were not wearing masks, were seen hugging each other while the speaker continued to chant “mass-spreader event”.

The coronavirus pandemic has steadily gotten worse in recent weeks across the United States, and experts warned it the surge could be heightened following holiday travel and gatherings.

Washington DC has recorded an average of 233 new coronavirus cases per day and hospitalisations were up by 12 per cent in the last week, The Washington Post reports. It is required for people to wear a mask when out in public in Washington DC, but police were not seen enforcing the mandate with rally attendees on Tuesday.

Multiple pro-Trump events were scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. The president has claimed the election was stolen from him despite only getting 232 Electoral College votes to Joe Biden’s 306. For multiple weeks the president has promoted these events and even said he might attend one.

The National Guard has been called in to respond to the protests in case the situation turns violent, and Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser implored residents to avoid Freedom Plaza, the Capitol, the Supreme Court – locations where rallies were being held.

“Make no mistake: many of these individuals have stated that they are coming to the District to provoke residents and wreak havoc,"" DC Attorney General Karl Racine said.

Road closures started in Washington DC on Tuesday in anticipation of the different rallies and would go through Wednesday.

Supporters would be gathering on Wednesday during the same time Congress was expected to meet to certify the Electoral College votes and declare Mr Biden the next president.

Mr Trump has claimed Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress could challenge the Electoral College votes of individual states, but this claim was incorrect. The certification process scheduled for Wednesday is largely ceremonial.

Neither Congress nor the vice president has the power to override the Electoral College and select their own presidential pick, although Republican attempts to raise a recognised objection could extend the process while debates are heard in both chambers.

But this hasn’t stopped the president from pushing members of his party to “stop the steal”, citing baseless claims of massive voter fraud."
"Warnock defeats Loeffler in Georgia, keeping alive Democrats' hopes of taking Senate, NBC News projects",270,krlmzb,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/georgia-senate-race-polls-close-election-will-decide-senate-control-n1252922,19,1609959301.0,,"ATLANTA — Democrats have swept both seats in Georgia’s critical runoff elections, NBC News projects, giving the party control of the Senate and removing a major roadblock for President-elect Joe Biden.

Democrat Jon Ossoff defeated Republican David Perdue in Tuesday’s election, NBC News projected Wednesday afternoon, while the network earlier called Georgia’s other race for Democrat Raphael Warnock over GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler.

Biden will now enter the White House on Jan. 20 with his party in control of both chambers of Congress, allowing him to confirm his Cabinet and judicial nominees and giving him and a chance to advance his legislative agenda, which would have gone nowhere as long as Republican Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., remained in charge.

The results are a rebuke of President Donald Trump, whose supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday to try to stop Congress from counting the Electoral College results. Trump's ongoing attempts to overturn the election results overshadowed the runoffs and some Republicans worried his attacks on the integrity of the election depressed GOP turnout in Georgia.

""Thank you so much for the confidence that you've placed in me,"" Ossoff told supporters in a video livestream. ""I am honored, honored by your support, by your confidence by your trust, and I will look forward to serving you in the United States Senate with integrity with humility, with honor and getting things done for the people of Georgia.""

The Senate will now be split 50-50, but Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris will be able to cast tie-breaking votes, putting Democrats in charge of the legislative agenda, committee chairmanships and Congress’ confirmation and investigative powers.

""We proved that with hope, hard works and the people by our side, anything is possible,"" Warnock told supporters Tuesday .

Biden and Senate Democratic leaders agree their top priority will be a new round of Covid-19 relief, especially after the president-elect promised Georgia voters this week that $2,000 stimulus checks would ""go out the door immediately"" if Democrats won the Senate.

“Georgia's voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday congratulating Ossoff and Warnock. “I have long said that the bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill passed in December was just a down payment. We need urgent action on what comes next.”

A friendly Congress also means Biden will be able to keep the government funded without threat of shutdown and partisan brinkmanship over the debt ceiling. And he won't have hostile congressional investigators making aggressive use of their subpoena power.

“As Majority Leader, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will have a partner who is ready, willing and able to help achieve a forward-looking agenda and deliver help and bold change to the American people,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is expected to take over as majority leader, said in a statement.

Notably, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is 82 years old and has been rumored to be waiting for a time to retire when his seat could be filled by another liberal.

But the fate of the larger progressive legislative agenda remains very much in doubt, given the Senate’s filibuster rule and the narrow size of Democrats' majority.

""If we have a Senate that is divided 50-50, that makes it very hard to do some of the things you just suggested like recognizing Puerto Rico as a state,"" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a close Biden ally, said on CNBC.

Schumer will face immense pressure from the left flank of his caucus to reform or eliminate the filibuster, but opposition from moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., has made it clear that that idea is basically dead on arrival.

With the filibuster in place, Republicans can block most legislation (unless Democrats can find 60 votes to overcome the procedure), imperiling many Biden priorities, from immigration reform to statehood for the District of Columbia.

""The only viable path to enacting D.C. statehood is bypassing the filibuster — a Jim Crow relic that has been used to block hundreds of racial justice bills,"" said DC statehood activist Stasha Rhodes.

There is one major exception to the filibuster rule for budget bills, which can through a process known as reconciliation that only a requires a simple majority, and Democrats are discussing ways to take full advantage of that rule or expand it.

The split chamber will put Harris in an unusual position as she is expected to take a more active role as president of the Senate, which is typically a mostly ceremonial role.

Since 1789, only 268 tie-breaking votes have been cast. Vice President Mike Pence cast 13 while Biden did not cast any during his eight years as vice president.

Warnock is the pastor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s former church in Atlanta. He will be the first Black senator from Georgia and only the 11th Black senator in American history. He won, in part, thanks to astronomical Black turnout.

He was born in Savannah, the eleventh of 12 children raised by his Pentecostal preacher parents in a public housing project before attending the historically black Morehouse College on a Pell grant.

The unusual election, in which the state conducted runoffs for two Senate seats at the same time, shattered spending records with the campaigns and allied super PACs inundating voters with more than half a billion dollars worth of advertising in the two months since the November general election.

Warnock's win in the special election means he will fill out the remainder of the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson, who stepped down for health reasons in late 2019. Loeffler was appointed to fill the seat until an election could be held. Warnock will have to run for re-election in 2022, when the term expires.

Ossoff will get to serve a full six-year term.

In some rural areas where the GOP needed to run up the score and counting was completed rapidly, Republican turnout appeared down slightly more than Democratic turnout compared to the November general election.

Meanwhile, turnout was up in Democratic-leaning and heavily African-American areas. The chairman of the board of elections in Fulton County, which includes most of heavily Democratic Atlanta, told reporters in a virtual briefing that Election Day turnout surpassed the November election.

A White House spokesperson referred questions about the shuffle back to the Department of Justice.

Trump’s installation of a new leader in the U.S. attorney’s office in Georgia’s largest city comes as he continues to rail against the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for failing to move aggressively against what he has baselessly alleged was rampant fraud in the November election in Georgia and in other swing states.

Georgia election officials have rebutted Trump’s claims in detail. In addition, former Attorney General Bill Barr said late last year that he saw no evidence of widespread fraud that could have affected the outcome of the election. Barr declined to appoint a special counsel to investigate such claims before he resigned last month.

U.S. attorneys are typically replaced following a change in presidential administrations and some do leave in advance of the formal transfer of power. Pak had been expected to stay on through Inauguration Day.

Pak’s resignation and Christine’s assignment were first reported by Talking Points Memo, which quoted an internal memo from Pak attributing his hasty departure to “unforeseen circumstances.” As of mid-morning Tuesday, the “Meet the U.S. Attorney” web page that used to contain Pak’s biography simply said “will be added shortly.”

Pak’s resignation came a day after the release of an explosive audio recording of a telephone call in which Trump berated Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, repeatedly raising specious claims of election fraud and insisting that the Republican official change the vote counts to show that Trump won.

At one point in the call, Trump seemed to denigrate a federal prosecutor in Georgia, saying, “You have your never-Trumper U.S. attorney there.” Trump did not appear to name anyone, but some associates of Pak believe the president may have been referring to him.

Last June, Barr made an awkward attempt to oust the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, and replace him on an acting basis with the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Craig Carpenito, who was viewed as more of a Trump loyalist. While Berman was tapped by the administration to take the job on an acting basis, he was never formally nominated to the post.

The attempted reshuffle prompted outrage from prosecutors in Berman’s office, some of whom had investigated Trump, his companies and his allies over campaign finance allegations and other issues. Barr ultimately backed away from the plan to install Carpenito and allowed the career first assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Audrey Strauss, to take the post on an acting basis."
'Care now has to be rationed': Los Angeles COVID-19 spike is crushing hospitals,20,kr9i77,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/05/covid-19-california-los-angeles-limit-hospital-transports/4141138001/,4,1609914435.0,,"CLOSE California officials are looking to speed up the pace of COVID-19 vaccine distribution, as the state braces for another holiday-related surge of confirmed cases. (Jan. 4) AP Domestic

As COVID-19 continues to overwhelm California hospitals, Los Angeles County officials are trying to ration medical supplies and hospital space.

The Los Angeles Emergency Medical Services Agency issued twomemos Monday instructing emergency responders to limit the use of supplemental oxygen and not transport patients who cannot be revived in the field.

""Given the acute need to conserve oxygen, effective immediately, EMS should only administer supplemental oxygen to patients with oxygen saturation below 90%,"" one memo said.Oxygen saturation at that threshold and above allows for sufficient blood flow in most patients, the memo said.

Adults experiencing cardiac arrest should not be transported to the hospital if they cannot be resuscitated in the field, according to the other memo. Patients whose hearts have stopped and, despite attempts to resuscitate, show no sign of breathing or movement, should be determined dead at the scene and should not be transported, the memo said.

Dr. Marianne Gausche-Hill, medical director of the agency, told USA TODAY that the new measures aim to optimize resources. At the beginning of the pandemic, public health officials feared they would run out of ventilators, but it's small, portable oxygen tanks that have turned out to be in high demand, she said.

""We are giving (oxygen), we're just trying to be cognizant that there's some scarcity, so we want to utilize it on those patients that it can serve,"" Gausche-Hill said.

The memo on resuscitation was ""not a big change"" from past guidance and reinforced the importance of resuscitating at the scene, she said.

""The best results are if you do compressions at the scene instead of transporting the patient in cardiac arrest to a hospital ... where nothing further is going to be done. It's pretty much futile,"" Gausche-Hill said. ""We’re facing a capacity crisis. We’re trying to work with all our partners to optimize hospital capacity.""

Vaccines: Polls show increasing trust in COVID-19 vaccine after months of decline

Ambulances are still having to wait many hours to offload patients to emergency rooms in Los Angeles County, Dr. Christina Ghaly, the county director of health services, said Monday. The county was encouraging people to only come to the emergency department or call 911 for medical or psychiatric emergencies, Ghaly said.

""Many hospitals have reached a point of crisis and are having to make very tough decisions about patient care,"" Ghaly said. ""EMS is working with all hospitals across the region to relieve the pressure on, especially, the smaller facilities.""

Cases are skyrocketing in Los Angeles County, which has now reached more than 800,000 cases, County Board of Supervisors Chair Hilda Solis said Monday.

""It took 10 months to hit 400,000 cases, but we have reached another 400,000 within the last month alone. That is a human disaster and one that was avoidable,"" Solis said. ""But I need to underscore that it could be worse. The situation is already beyond our imagination, but it could become beyond comprehension if the health restrictions in place are not fully obeyed.""

Hospitals are declaring internal disasters and opening gyms to serve as health care units, Solis said. Oxygen is in high demand, and Army Corps of Engineers crews arrived in the county Saturday to update oxygen delivery systems in the area.

""We are pushing the limits of the hospital infrastructure,"" Solis said. ""... Care now has to be rationed.""

As of Sunday, nearly 8,000 coronavirus patients were in county hospitals, according to state data. More than 1,600 coronavirus patients were in the ICU, and just 326 ICU beds were available.

A person is dying from COVID-19 every 15 minutes in the county, which could soon be looking at weekly death tolls of 1,000 or more, County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Monday.

The surge in cases is ""distressing"" for people who may need access to emergency care, Ferrer said. ""People who have a stroke or a heart attack or experience a traumatic injury from a car crash are finding it more difficult to access care compared to months ago.""

The surge is the early result of an anticipated uptick following holiday gatherings, Ferrer said.

""We’re likely to experience the worst conditions in January that we’ve faced the entire pandemic, and that’s hard to imagine,"" Ferrer said. ""The increases in cases are likely to continue for weeks to come.""

Los Angeles County isn't alone in the surge. Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties each have more than 1,500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and fewer than a hundred ICU beds available, according to state data. Among the top 100 hospitals nationwide with the highest proportion of COVID-19 patients, 48 are in California, a USA TODAY analysis found.

Officials in San Bernardino and Riverside counties told USA TODAY that they did not anticipate issuing similar guidance on oxygen and transports at this time.

Loeffler’s Husband Entangled in Secret Gov’t Surveillance Operation,34,kr6d9a,https://www.thedailybeast.com/loefflers-husband-jeffrey-sprecher-entangled-in-usmarshals-service-domestic-surveillance-operation?ref=wrap,11,1609905650.0,,"Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s husband is renting out an airport hangar to the U.S. Marshals Service for what appears to be a domestic surveillance operation—at a very nice profit—in a deal shrouded in secrecy.

That operation, a nationwide cell phone monitoring campaign first reported by The Wall Street Journal in 2014, provoked an outcry from Loeffler’s colleagues from Oregon last year after local media discovered that a Marshals Service plane had circled for hours over an anti-racist protest in Portland on June 13.

Three days later, flight records show that exact plane touched down at Fulton County Airport in Atlanta, Georgia—where the Marshals Service leases space from Fulton County Hangar Services, part of the vast business empire run by Loeffler’s husband, Jeffrey Sprecher. The federal government renewed its rental relationship with the company the same month.

The hangar at 4165 South Airport Rd. Northwest, which Loeffler identified as one of her husband’s holdings in her first financial disclosure after her appointment to the Senate last year, sits along a scarred service route at the Fulton County Airport, off the main artery of Martin Luther King Drive.

The General Services Administration, which rents space on behalf of other federal agencies, confirmed to The Daily Beast that it has paid Fulton County Hangar Services almost $250,000 a year for the location since 2014 when Loeffler was still an executive at her husband’s company, Intercontinental Exchange, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange. The GSA added that it extended the lease for another three years last summer.

But the details of the arrangement are enveloped in layers of government and corporate opacity. Fulton County Hangar Services is a registered federal contractor, but its contracts are not available to view in any public database. The System for Award Management, a government search engine for tracking the federal government’s business dealings, classifies the information on the company as “restricted.” When pressed by The Daily Beast, the GSA declined to answer what agencies are stationed at the hangar and for what purpose, citing the “mission sensitivities of the federal tenants at this facility.”

The Federal Aviation Administration operated out of the hangar until November 2019 but told The Daily Beast that it is now a U.S. Marshals installation.

The Marshals Service refused to answer questions about its presence and activities at the hangar, and neither Loeffler, Sprecher, Intercontinental Exchange, nor Fulton County—which owns Fulton County Airport and leases hangars there to private tenants—responded to repeated requests for comment.

Public records yield a few clues. The Daily Beast found that several small Cessna aircraft registered either to the Marshals Service or to Early Detection Alarm Services, a company Buzzfeed exposed in 2017 as a front for the law enforcement agency’s aerial cell phone surveillance activities, have flown into or out of Fulton County Airport.

One such craft is the Cessna Caravan the Willamette Week newspaper spotted in the skies over unrest-rocked Portland last June, and which riled Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, along with several other congressional Democrats from Oregon. The tracking website FlightRadar24.com identified at least eight flights that this plane, with the tail number N1789M, made to or from the municipal airfield in 2020.

On three occasions, FlightRadar24.com shows the propeller-powered Cessna making prolonged loops around Atlanta or other portions of Georgia similar to those observed on the West Coast, though The Daily Beast could not correlate these trips with specific events on the ground.

Finally, Fulton County remits a small tax bill each year for personal property at the Marshals-occupied hangar to L3Harris Technologies. One of the federal government’s largest contractors, L3Harris famously manufactures the Stingray for the Marshals Service and other government agencies. The Stingray collects information by imitating a cell phone tower and fooling mobile devices into revealing their whereabouts and other sensitive data, which law enforcement officials can use to track their owners.

L3Harris did not answer repeated questions about their receipt of the tax bill, or about their assets at or access to 4165 South Airport Road Northwest.

The contract between the federal government and Fulton County Hangar Services preceded Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s appointment of Loeffler to the Senate seat by roughly six years, and there is no evidence she played any role in its original negotiation or in its renewal last year. The Daily Beast found records of aircraft belonging to Early Detection Alarm Systems flying into Fulton County Airport as far back as 2009—when the GSA says it was renting the same hangar from a North Carolina-based real estate company—and FAA directories date that agency’s presence at the site to 1990.

However, Fulton County Hangar Services is registered with the federal government in Loeffler's husband’s name and with his personal contact information, and at the address of the lavish home they share in Atlanta.

The Daily Beast also could not find any record of a financial arrangement directly between Fulton County itself, which appears to own the hangar along with the rest of the airport, and Fulton County Hangar Services, even though documents of the previous arrangement with the North Carolina real estate firm are accessible on its website.

Rather, online records show a lease between the county and an Intercontinental Exchange affiliate called ICE 4165 LLC for one-and-a-half acres of land at the airport from 2016, two years after the contract between GSA and Fulton County Hangar Services began. The ground lease from the county grants ICE 4165 use of the space for 20 years with two automatic five-year renewals, at an annual rent of $20,597.16, plus a 3 percent increase every half-decade.

This is approximately 1/12th of what the GSA pays annually to Fulton County Hangar Services for the use of 4165 South Airport Northwest. The lease shows no history of a bidding process, but cites the need to ensure “the continuation of rental revenue to the county.” The rate is, however, comparable to what the North Carolina company paid the county during the previous decade.

“ I think that Loeffler and the U.S. Marshals Service should answer some questions about the lease and what is happening out of that space. ” — Scott Amey, Project on Government Oversight

Transparency experts marveled at the strangeness and inscrutability of the arrangements between Sprecher’s companies, Fulton County, and the federal government.

“Weird and secretive, which is a bad mix!” remarked Scott Amey, general counsel to the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight. “It would be big news if they are involved in violating people’s privacy or civil rights and the senator is making money from those activities.”

“I think that Loeffler and the U.S. Marshals Service should answer some questions about the lease and what is happening out of that space,” Amey added.

Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, suggested the tangle of public-private relationships resembles the sort of “cover” the U.S. has used to conceal covert military and espionage operations. What makes this particular situation unusual, he asserted, is that the arm of the federal government involved is the Marshals Service.

“This is a security measure employed mainly by intelligence agencies. It's not something one would immediately associate with the U.S. Marshals,” Aftergood said. “It may be that the primary use of the facility is to support clandestine surveillance operations, which could explain the extraordinary secrecy.”"

Updated at 11:38 a.m. ET

In his ongoing quest to overturn the November election, President Trump has demanded total loyalty of his fellow Republicans around the country, but nowhere more dramatically than Georgia — where the last thing Republicans needed was an intraparty fight heading into its competitive U.S. Senate runoffs on Tuesday.

In recent weeks, the state's top Republican officials have resisted Trump's demands to overturn what has been upheld as a secure election. In a bombshell phone call leaked over the weekend, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood firm against the president's lobbying for him to ""find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state"" and ""recalculate"" the vote tally in his favor.

In recent weeks, the president has taken to regularly berating officials — including Raffensperger — on Twitter, encouraging a 2022 primary challenge to former close ally Gov. Brian Kemp, and last week in calling for Kemp to resign. It all begs the larger question of how this destabilization could affect Republicans' chances in the newly minted battleground state.

President-elect Joe Biden won Georgia by nearly 12,000 votes. The Republican secretary of state and U.S. attorney general have said there's been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the November election.

At a Monday night rally in Dalton, Ga., Trump vowed to ""fight like hell"" to keep the White House, again falsely alleging that Democrats stole the election.

The situation created by Trump has left many Georgia Republican operatives incredulous, especially because the high-profile Republican drama comes as voters in Georgia are set to determine the balance of power in the Senate through two Tuesday runoffs. Polls show the races as close, and it's evident that neither party can afford to leave any votes on the table.

What's been happening among Georgia Republicans is relevant to the national Republican Party, said Heath Garrett, a Georgia Republican strategist who previously served as a top aide to former Sen. Johnny Isakson.

""There's definitely a civil war, if you will, brewing in the Republican Party, but not just in Georgia,"" Garrett said. ""It's what does a post-Trump presidency look like? And can we bring it back together?""

""Do not self-suppress your own vote""

For Kemp, the runoffs and implications for Republicans in Georgia are clearly front of mind.

""No one, whether you're mad at me, whether you like me, should get distracted by anything other than getting out to vote,"" Kemp responded at a press conference hours after Trump's tweet calling for Kemp's resignation. ""That is where my focus is. I don't want to wake up on January the 6th and wonder what else I should have done.""

One of Raffensperger's top deputies, Gabriel Sterling, reiterated the same message on Monday as he debunked a litany of conspiracy theories the president has perpetuated. ""Given the nature of the president's statements ... We are specifically asking and telling you to turn out and vote tomorrow,"" Sterling said. ""Do not self-suppress your own vote.""

Yet Trump's attacks on Kemp, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and Raffensperger have, at best, sown confusion and, at worst, caused some Republican voters in Georgia to turn against their officials. The president has also put the two incumbent Republican senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, in the unenviable position of being in the middle.

""Whipsawed by their own party""

""Sen. Perdue and Sen. Loeffler have been whipsawed by their own party and by their own president,"" Garrett said.

The two senators' relationships with Kemp in particular have been close. Perdue's lobbying secured Kemp a crucial Republican primary endorsement from Trump in 2018. Loeffler wouldn't be a senator without Kemp, who appointed her to the position last year against the president's wishes.

And yet, Loeffler and Perdue have stayed in lockstep with Trump during their runoff campaigns, refraining from congratulating Biden and breaking with their caucus to support what had been a Democratic priority of $2,000 in coronavirus relief checks because Trump took up the cause.

They supported an unsuccessful lawsuit led by the state of Texas in the Supreme Court against the state of Georgia to overturn the election results, have not spoken out in Kemp's defense, and quickly called for Raffensperger's resignation in November.

Loeffler said Monday she would object to Congress' Wednesday Electoral College vote tally. (Perdue's term has technically expired, though he said he supports the objections.)

Loeffler, who has repeatedly labeled herself ""100% with President Trump,"" has avoided directly answering questions from the press about the tape of Raffensperger and the president's conversation, as well as the call for Kemp's resignation.

Instead of trying to appeal to independent or more moderate Republicans as well as the Republican base, Garrett said, Loeffler and Perdue have been ""forced"" to focus on what would normally be easier voters to count on among their base. ""The problem was, you had this huge megaphone out of Washington telling them 'Don't trust the system,' "" Garrett said.

""The problem is the messages are almost so different,"" he said. ""The more you talk about Trump, the less you can talk to independents or soft Republicans in the suburbs.""

And the November numbers indicate there are some voters in the middle who voted a split ticket, for Biden and Senate Republicans.

Perdue slightly outperformed Trump in Georgia in November, while his Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, slightly underperformed Biden. Trump lost to Biden by nearly 12,000 votes, but Perdue earned nearly 90,000 more votes than Ossoff.

The question, Garrett said, is whether Trump will be a ""constructive"" force in Republican primaries by backing candidates like Kemp, or back pro-Trump challengers and undermine Republicans' ability to win statewide in competitive states like Georgia.

""The big question among us, as operatives in this world is, are we going to have to lose races in 2022 and 2024, that we should have won, because of [Trump's] outsize influence in Republican primaries?"" he said.

""There are very few things that I can say I would guarantee, but I can guarantee that if there's a well-funded Trump challenge to Brian Kemp as governor, then [former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and voting activist] Stacey Abrams is most likely the next governor of the state of Georgia,"" he said. ""And we as Republicans better come to grips with that reality."""
"U.S. Attorney for North Georgia resigns, effective immediately",7,kqi0du,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-us-attorney-for-north-georgia-resigns-effective-immediately/UDJNKRKKLRFILC4NC5QKWEUKXM/,3,1609823329.0,,"On Sunday, an audio recording became public of a conversation between Trump and his allies and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump pressured the state’s top elections official to help him “find” enough votes to overturn the Nov. 3 contest, in which President-elect Joe Biden won by nearly 12,000 votes.

On the recording, Trump references a “never-Trumper U.S. attorney there.”

It’s unclear if that’s a reference to Pak. But Atlanta and Fulton County are within the Northern District of Georgia, and in the recording, Trump talks repeatedly of debunked accusations of electoral fraud in Georgia, including in Fulton.

Experts: Did Trump break the law with phone call to Georgia elections official?

When he was appointed by Trump, Pak took over an office conducting a wide-ranging public corruption investigation of Atlanta City Hall and the administration of then-Mayor Kasim Reed that stretched back to at least the summer of 2015.

Pak devoted significant resources to the investigation, which to date has resulted in seven guilty pleas of contractors and city officials and four indictments, including the city’s former chief financial officer Jim Beard and political consultant Mitzi Bickers. Those trials are pending.

Pak also took on a high-ranking member of his own party. In May 2019, a federal grand jury indicted Jim Beck, then the state’s insurance commissioner, accusing him of stealing more than $2 million from a state-backed insurance association. Beck has pleaded not guilty and his trial is expected later this year.

In a somewhat rare move for a district’s top prosecutor, Pak planned to help try the Beck case himself.

Pak’s office also was involved in the sprawling investigation into the hacking of credit reporting giant Equifax.

Pak said the most fulfilling parts of the job involved working with law enforcement partners.

“My hope is that my tenure in the office will be remembered for our efforts to serve and to support those brave agents and officers,” he said. “I have witnessed first-hand the fortitude and grace of victims of crime and have taken to heart the awesome responsibility of speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves.”

Monday’s announcement came less than a month after the top prosecutor for the U.S. District Court in Middle Georgia announced his resignation. U.S. Attorney Charles E. “Charlie” Peeler, who was also appointed in 2017 by Trump, resigned Dec. 11. Peter D. Leary currently serves as the Acting U.S. Attorney for Middle Georgia.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Bracing for possible violence, the nation’s capital has mobilized the National Guard ahead of planned protests by President Donald Trump’s supporters in connection with the congressional vote expected Wednesday to affirm Joe Biden’s election victory.

Trump’s supporters are planning to rally Tuesday and Wednesday, seeking to bolster the president’s unproven claims of widespread voter fraud. “There are people intent on coming to our city armed,” D.C. Acting Police Chief Robert Contee said Monday.

A pro-Trump rally in December ended in violence as hundreds of Trump supporters, wearing the signature black and yellow of the Proud Boys faction, sought out confrontations with a collective of local activists attempting to bar them from Black Lives Matter Plaza, an area near the White House.

On Monday, Metropolitan Police Department officers arrested the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, 36, after he arrived in Washington ahead of this week’s protests. Tarrio was accused of burning a Black Lives Matter banner that was torn down from a historic Black church in downtown Washington during the December protests.

A warrant had been issued for Tarrio’s arrest for destruction of property, police said. He was also facing a weapons charges after officers found him with two high-capacity firearm magazines when he was arrested, a police spokesman said.

Trump has repeatedly encouraged this week’s protests and hinted that he may get personally involved. Over the weekend, he retweeted a promotion for the rally with the message, “I will be there. Historic Day!”

At a November rally, which drew about 15,000 people, Trump staged a limousine drive-by past cheering crowds in Freedom Plaza, on the city’s iconic Pennsylvania Avenue. And at the December rally, which drew smaller numbers but a larger contingent of Proud Boys, Trump’s helicopter flew low over cheering crowds on the National Mall.

The protests coincide with Wednesday’s congressional vote expected to certify the Electoral College results, which Trump continues to dispute,

Election officials from both political parties, governors in key battleground states and Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have said there was no widespread fraud in the election. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two rejected by the Supreme Court.

Now with downtown D.C. businesses boarding up their windows, Mayor Muriel Bowser has requested a limited National Guard deployment to help bolster the Metropolitan Police Department. During a press conference on Monday, Bowser asked that local area residents stay away from downtown D.C., and avoid confrontations with anyone who is “looking for a fight.” But, she warned, “we will not allow people to incite violence, intimidate our residents or cause destruction in our city.”

According to a U.S. defense official, Bowser put in a request on New Year’s Eve to have Guard members on the streets from Tuesday to Thursday to help with the protests. The official said the additional forces will be used for traffic control and other assistance but they will not be armed or wearing body armor. Congress is meeting this week to certify the Electoral College results, and Trump has refused to concede while whipping up support for protests.

Some 340 D.C. National Guard members will be activated, with about 115 on duty in the streets at any given time, said the defense official, who provided details on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The official said Guard members will be used to set up traffic control points around the city and to stand with district police officers at all the city’s Metro stops. Contee said Guard troops will also be used for some crowd management.

“Some of our intelligence certainly suggests there will be increased crowd sizes,” said Contee.

D.C. police have posted signs throughout downtown warning that carrying any sort of firearm is illegal and Contee asked area residents to warn authorities of anyone who might be armed.

Because D.C. does not have a governor, the designated commander of the city’s National Guard is Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Any D.C. requests for Guard deployments have to be approved by him.

The defense official said that there will be no active duty military troops in the city, and the U.S. military will not be providing any aircraft or intelligence. The D.C. Guard will provide specialized teams that will be prepared to respond to any chemical or biological incident. But the official said there will be no D.C. Guard members on the National Mall or at the U.S. Capitol.

At previous pro-Trump protests, police have sealed off Black Lives Matter Plaza itself, but the confrontations merely spilled out to the surrounding streets. Contee on Monday said sealing the area again was “a very real possibility” but said that decision would depend on the circumstances.

“We know that historically over the last few demonstrations that BLM plaza has been a focal point,” Contee said. “We want to make sure that that is not an issue.”

The National Park Service has received three separate applications for pro-Trump protests on Tuesday or Wednesday, with estimated maximum attendance at around 15,000 people, said Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst. On Monday, a stage was being assembled for one of the protests on The Ellipse, just south of the White House.

Organizers plan to rally on Tuesday evening at Freedom Plaza and again all day Wednesday on the Ellipse, including a 1 p.m. Wednesday march to the Capitol. Expected attendees include high-level Trump supporters like Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Republican strategist Roger Stone, a longtime Trump devotee whose three-year prison sentence was commuted by Trump. Stone was convicted of repeatedly lying to Congress during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

During the Dec. 12 pro-Trump protests, at least two local Black churches had Black Lives Matter banners torn down and set ablaze. Contee said the hate-crimes investigation into those incidents was still ongoing and that his officers would be out in force around area churches to prevent similar incidents.

“We will be increasing out visibility around the churches in the area,” he said.

On Monday the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court against the Proud Boys and Tarrio on behalf on one of the vandalized churches, Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church.

“We will not allow white supremacist violence to go unchecked by the laws of the land,” Rev. William H Lamar IV, pastor of Metropolitan AME, said in a statement.

Ex-Pentagon chiefs warn against using US military in election row,69,kqb6vh,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/4/ex-pentagon-chiefs-warn-against-using-us-military-in-election-row,3,1609803835.0,,"In a joint op-ed, all 10 living former secretaries of defence say any effort to involve US military in election disputes is dangerous.

In an extraordinary rebuke of US President Donald Trump, all 10 living former secretaries of defence cautioned on Sunday against any move to involve the military in pursuing claims of election fraud, arguing that it would take the country into “dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory”.

The 10 men, both Democrats and Republicans, signed on to an opinion article published in The Washington Post newspaper that implicitly questioned Trump’s willingness to follow his constitutional duty to peacefully relinquish power on January 20.

They included Mark Esper who was fired by Trump in November as well as another Trump defense chief James Mattis.

The group said the time had come to accept that the Republican president had lost the November 3 election and that Biden would succeed him on January 20.

“Our elections have occurred. Recounts and audits have been conducted. Appropriate challenges have been addressed by the courts. Governors have certified the results. And the electoral college has voted,” they said in the opinion piece. “The time for questioning the results has passed.”

And it is now time to formally certify the Electoral College votes, they said.

The former Pentagon chiefs warned against use of the military in any effort to change the outcome.

“Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory,” they wrote. “Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic.”

A number of senior military officers, including General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have said publicly in recent weeks that the military has no role in determining the outcome of US elections and that their loyalty is to the constitution, not to an individual leader or a political party.

David Tafuri, a lawyer and adviser to Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, called the op-ed an “extraordinary development”.

“The fact that they all got together and did this suggests that they are worried Trump is putting pressure on the Pentagon and may try to use the military,” Tafuri told Al Jazeera. “This falls very much outside the tradition of keeping the US military out of domestic affairs and out of engaging in an act that could overturn a lawful US election.”

The 10 former Pentagon leaders also warned in their Post article of the dangers of impeding a full and smooth transition at Defense Department prior to Inauguration Day as part of a transfer to power to Biden. The president-elect in late December complained of efforts by Trump-appointed Pentagon officials to obstruct the transition.

Biden said political appointees at the Pentagon, which Trump has packed with loyalists since the election, have refused to provide a “clear picture” on troop posture or budgeting.

Without mentioning a specific example, the former defence secretaries wrote that transfers of power “often occur at times of international uncertainty about US national security policy and posture,” adding: “They can be a moment when the nation is vulnerable to actions by adversaries seeking to take advantage of the situation.”

Tensions with Iran represent just such a moment. Sunday marked one year since the US killing of Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general; Iran has pledged to avenge the killing and US officials said in recent days that they are on heightened alert for a potential Iranian attack on US forces or interests in the Middle East.

In a further sign of US-Iranian tension, the acting Secretary of Defense, Christopher Miller, announced on evening that he has changed his mind about sending the Navy aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, home from the Middle East and instead will keep the vessel on duty. Just last week, Miller announced that he was sending the Nimitz home, a decision that had been opposed by senior military officers.

In reversing himself, Miller cited “recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other US government officials”. He did not elaborate, and the Pentagon did not respond to questions.

In addition to Mattis and Esper, the opinion article in the Post was signed by Dick Cheney, William Perry, Donald Rumsfeld, William Cohen, Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel and Ash Carter.

The Post reported that the idea for writing the opinion piece began with a conversation between Cheney and Eric Edelman, a retired ambassador and former senior Pentagon official, about how Trump might seek to use the military in the coming days."

WINONA, Texas (AP) — A 21-year-old man who hid from police in an East Texas church was charged with first-degree murder and felony assault in a shooting that left the pastor dead and two other people injured Sunday, a local sheriff said.

Authorities had been using dogs and drones to search for the man late Saturday in woods near Winona following a car chase, and the pastor of the nearby Starrville Methodist Church discovered him hiding in a church bathroom Sunday morning, Smith County Sheriff Larry Smith said at a news conference.

Smith said police were initially pursuing the man because he was suspected of brandishing a shotgun through the sunroof of a Volkswagen Jetta he was driving Saturday. Authorities believe the suspect, identified as 21-year-old Mytrez Deunte Woolen of Marshall, Texas, broke into the church after police had left the area around 2 a.m. Sunday.

Pastor Mark Allen McWilliams, 62, drew a gun and ordered Woolen to stop, Smith said, but Woolen grabbed the weapon and began shooting with it. McWilliams was killed, a second person was injured by gunfire and another was hurt in a fall.

Woolen then stole the pastor’s vehicle and fled east before being arrested by deputies in nearby Harrison County, Smith said. He said Woolen was hospitalized Sunday afternoon with gunshot wounds to his hand, but that it’s unclear when he was shot.

Woolen was charged with felony assault and capital murder. He’s being held at Smith County Jail, and bond is set at $3.5 million.

The shooting was reported around 9:20 a.m., and there were no services going on at that time, said Sgt. Larry Christian, of the sheriff’s office. Smith said the pastor, his wife and two other people were in the church at the time.

Woolen appears to have taken shelter in the church out of convenience and there’s nothing to indicate the shooting was motivated by religious animus, the sheriff said.

“This is not a church-related, religion-related offense,” said Smith.

Gov. Greg Abbott sent his condolences.

“Our hearts are with the victims and the families of those killed or injured in this terrible tragedy,” he said in a statement.

It’s unclear exactly when Woolen entered the church in Starrville, near Winona, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Dallas.

Representatives of Starrville Methodist could not be immediately reached for comment. Starrville Methodist was built in 1853, according to the Texas State Historical Association.

The shooting came a little more than a year after a gunman opened fire at a church near Fort Worth, killing two people before he was fatally shot by a congregant.

Texas officials hailed the congregant’s quick action, saying it prevented further killing and showed the effectiveness of the state’s permissive gun laws, including a 2019 measure that affirmed the right of licensed handgun holders to carry a weapon in places of worship.

That law was passed in response to the 2017 massacre at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, where a man fatally shot more than two dozen people at a Sunday service before taking his own life.

Since then, a cottage industry has sprung up in Texas and other states to train and arm civilians to protect their churches using the techniques and equipment of law enforcement."

Former Walmart Pharmacists Say Company Ignored Red Flags As Opioid Sales Boomed,271,kplxkf,https://www.npr.org/2021/01/03/950870632/former-walmart-pharmacists-say-company-ignored-red-flags-as-opioid-sales-boomed,39,1609714769.0,,"Former Walmart Pharmacists Say Company Ignored Red Flags As Opioid Sales Boomed

When Ashwani Sheoran showed up for early morning shifts at pharmacies in rural Michigan wearing his white Walmart smock, he often found customers waiting, desperate for bottles of pain pills.

""I see my patients, 15 to 20, already lined up to get prescriptions filled for morphine sulfate, oxycodone and other straight narcotics,"" he said.

This was in 2012 when the prescription opioid epidemic was exploding, killing tens of thousands of Americans every year.

Sheoran, now 41, told NPR he kept seeing what the Drug Enforcement Administration considers ""red flags."" Patients were driving long distances to buy their pills from Walmart. They couldn't explain why they needed such powerful opioid doses.

He started raising alarms, sending emails to his bosses in Michigan and to Walmart headquarters in Arkansas. He warned that their pharmacies were feeding a black market for opioids like Oxycontin.

What happened next made him angry. ""They start putting more pressure on me to just be quiet and not to say anything more,"" Sheoran said.

""They told me, 'Do not reach out to the DEA, do not call the police. If you do so, your employment is going to be terminated immediately,' "" Sheoran said, describing a warning he said was issued by his supervisor.

Walmart is facing a public reckoning over its role in the nation's deadly opioid epidemic, which killed about 450,000 Americans from 1999 to 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Justice Department, along with state and local governments, are suing the retail giant, claiming Walmart shipped and sold billions of highly addictive pills without proper safeguards.

Walmart says the company acted responsibly.

But Sheoran wasn't alone in raising concerns. An NPR investigation, based on interviews and government court filings, found that Walmart pharmacists warned for years about opioid sales that appeared dangerous or illegal.

Red flags kept popping up

Walmart operates more than 5,000 pharmacies nationwide, many located in rural areas hard hit by the opioid epidemic.

Sheoran worked for roughly a year as a ""floater"" pharmacist at the company's stores in small towns north of Detroit, places like Bad Axe and Caro.

He said red flags kept popping up. Prescriptions weren't filled out properly, and physician signatures sometimes appeared to be printed by a computer. When he tried to reach doctors to find out what was happening, he often couldn't get them on the phone.

""Which is a direct indication that those prescriptions are not for any genuine medical purpose and instead are being abused by the patient and distributed on the street,"" Sheoran said.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, doctors write prescriptions for their patients, but pharmacists like Sheoran are required to serve as a kind of second gatekeeper.

It's their job to make sure that powerful, highly addictive drugs like opioids are dispensed and sold only for legitimate medical purposes.

Sheoran said he often rejected suspicious prescriptions. Police records and emails reviewed by NPR show he also notified local police and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

He was later suspended and then fired by Walmart early in 2013. He sued the company under a federal whistleblower statute, claiming his warnings went unheeded. That case is still pending.

Other Walmart pharmacist raised alarms

Internal company documents made public last month as part of a Justice Department lawsuit against Walmart show pharmacists all over the country warned Walmart executives about opioid sales that appeared unsafe.

Pharmacists complained that dangerous ""pill-mill"" doctors were sending patients to Walmart after other chains stopped filling their opioid prescriptions. Pharmacists sent emails to Walmart executives saying they feared losing their licenses and their jobs because of opioid sales.

According to the DOJ complaint, patients often paid in cash, also considered a red flag by the DEA. A pharmacist at a Walmart store in Texas said filling opioid prescriptions ""is a risk that keeps me up at night.""

As part of its complaint against Walmart, the Justice Department pointed to one case in North Carolina where a doctor was eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison for illegal opioid prescribing.

""Walmart's own pharmacists reported concerns about the doctor up the corporate chain, but for years, Walmart did nothing except continue to dispense thousands of opioid pills,"" said Robert Higdon, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, in a statement.

Walmart says federal regulators trying to shift blame

Walmart declined NPR's repeated requests for interviews, and a spokesman didn't respond to a list of detailed questions.

In an October complaint filed by Walmart against the DOJ and the DEA, company attorneys blamed the opioid epidemic on problem doctors and government regulators.

As part of that filing, the company acknowledged it was warned about ""red flags"" by the DEA that could indicate prescriptions might be unsafe or illegal.

But, according to Walmart, those alerts weren't legally binding and amounted to what the company characterizes as ""mere guidance.""

Walmart also argued it was the job of government regulators, not Walmart, to crack down on dangerous pill-mill doctors.

""By demanding pharmacists and pharmacies second-guess doctors, the Justice Department is putting pharmacists and pharmacies between a rock and a hard place,"" Walmart said in a statement.

Could Walmart pharmacists say no?

In public statements, Walmart also highlighted the fact that its pharmacists had the authority to reject suspicious prescriptions; the company says that happened frequently at its stores.

""Walmart always empowered our pharmacists to refuse to fill problematic opioids prescriptions, and they refused to fill hundreds of thousands of such prescriptions,"" the company said in a statement.

That sounds like a lot. But federal data shows Walmart stores dispensed hundreds of millions of opioid pills a year.

Loading...

The company shipped the equivalent of roughly 5.2 billion opioid pills to its chain of 5,000 pharmacies between 2006 and 2012. Those are years when records collected by the DEA are publicly available.

Former Walmart pharmacists and other industry experts told NPR there was intense pressure to sell opioids and fill prescriptions quickly and without asking a lot of questions.

""When they say they gave pharmacists the ability to use their professional judgment, did they?"" said Nicholas Hagemeier, a pharmacist and professor who studies opioid dispensing at East Tennessee State University.

According to Hagemeier, Walmart pharmacists – like other chain pharmacy employees – often lacked the time, the training, the information and the corporate backing to review opioid prescriptions properly.

Hagemeier surveyed pharmacists nationwide and found those working at chain pharmacies, including Walmart, were more likely to fear disciplinary action if they questioned too many opioid prescriptions. Bonuses were often linked to sales and efficiency, not safety.

""There is no incentive financially to say no,"" he said.

Opioid pills dispensed, no questions asked

Critics say the impact of these decisions on Americans who shopped at Walmart pharmacies was often devastating. Christina Dine was in her 20s when she was prescribed high doses of oxycodone by a doctor in Ohio who later lost his license.

As she fell into addiction in 2012, Dine said no one at the local Walmart where she often bought her pills intervened or warned her of the danger.

""They took it and filled it like any other prescription. I never once had a pharmacist or any other pharmacy staff question it, question me, ask me any questions whatsoever.""

Dine, 33, is a recovery nurse now, helping others struggling with addiction. But she lost years of her life to prescription opioid and heroin use.

""I first got sober in 2015 after my daughter's father overdosed and died. I kind of went in and out. I kind of struggled for a bit, but I've been sober since 2017,"" she told NPR.

Court documents filed by the Justice Department show federal regulators informed the company as early as 2009 that its system for managing high-risk medications wasn't robust enough to keep patients safe. Under pressure from the DEA, Walmart signed an agreement in 2011 promising reforms.

DEA raided a Walmart pharmacy in 2016

Critics say unsafe practices continued. In 2016, federal agents raided a Walmart pharmacy in Texas as part of a probe into a pair of pill-mill doctors who are now in prison, one serving a 20-year term and the other serving a 10-year term.

Court filings and public statements by former Justice Department officials show the government considered bringing criminal charges against Walmart as part of that case.

However, this December, the Justice Department filed a civil suit alleging Walmart ""unlawfully filled thousands upon thousands of invalid controlled-substance prescriptions."" According to the DOJ, penalties could run into the billions of dollars.

""Walmart had the responsibility and the means to help prevent the diversion of prescription opioids,"" said Jeffrey Bossert Clark, acting assistant attorney general of the DOJ's Civil Division.

""Instead, for years, it did the opposite — filling thousands of invalid prescriptions at its pharmacies and failing to report suspicious orders of opioids and other drugs placed by those pharmacies.""

These arguments, and Walmart's counterclaim that federal regulators are to blame for the opioid crisis, will be tested in court as lawsuits against the company filed by the DOJ and local and state governments move forward.

Last year, the company urged federal Judge Dan Polster to dismiss a key opioid suit brought by two Ohio counties that's widely expected to serve as a test of Walmart's liability.

Polster rejected that motion and pointed to what he described as ""obvious deficiencies"" in Walmart's opioid safety practices. The case is expected to go to trial later this year.

Facing similar legal pressure and a fierce public backlash for its role in the opioid crisis, Purdue Pharma, the maker of Oxycontin, agreed last year to settle with the federal government for $8.3 billion.

Walmart has promised to defend its opioid practices in court, claiming federal investigators have acted unethically as part of a scheme to ""embarrass"" the company to leverage a large cash settlement.

Governments suing Walmart say any settlements or fines paid by the company would go to help communities struggling with the opioid crisis.

Other national pharmacy chains including CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens face similar lawsuits linked to their roles in the opioid trade.

Ashwani Sheoran said if more companies had served in their gatekeeper role at the start of the epidemic, a lot of harm might have been avoided.

""It's very painful. This is not only affecting the patient, it's affecting the people around the patient, the whole society around the patient. We as pharmacists had a responsibility to save lives,"" Sheoran said."
GOP senators threaten to object to Electoral College results if commission is not formed,284,kp4ce5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1252667,86,1609645964.0,,"Nearly a dozen Republican senators and senators-elect demanded Saturday that a commission audit the results of the 2020 election and said they would otherwise object to the Electoral College votes that declared President-elect Joe Biden the winner.

Even though there is no evidence of any fraud in the election — despite numerous claims by President Donald Trump — the group of lawmakers said in a statement that they were calling on Congress to create a commission with ""full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states.""

The new Congress is to meet Wednesday to formally count the Electoral College votes, the majority of which Biden won. The group of Republican lawmakers threatened ""to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed.""

With the House in Democratic hands, there is no chance that the action will have any effect on the outcome, and Biden will be sworn in on Jan. 20. But the action by Republicans in both chambers will prolong the debate over certification until the final votes are tallied in Congress.

Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Braun of Indiana signed on to the statement Saturday, as did Sens.-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.

The senators stopped short in their statement of saying they would bring forward a vote to object to the results.

Already, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she would vote to affirm the results, urging her colleagues from both parties to recognize the outcome and to ""join me in maintaining confidence in the Electoral College and our elections so that we ensure we have the continued trust of the American people.""

Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, one of the states where Trump has been contesting the results, said: ""I voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday, I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.""

An objection is not considered unless it is in writing and signed by both a member of the House and a member of the Senate. For the objection to be sustained, both chambers must vote for it by simple majorities. If the chambers do not both agree, the original electoral votes are counted.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who will be one of four lawmakers who participate in tallying electoral votes as the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, criticized the Republicans' move as a ""publicity stunt.""

""It is undemocratic. It is un-American,"" she said. ""And fortunately it will be unsuccessful. In the end, democracy will prevail.""

Biden campaign spokesman Mike Gwin also dismissed it as stunt that ""won't change the fact that President-elect Biden will be sworn in on January 20th, and these baseless claims have already been examined and dismissed by Trump's own Attorney General, dozens of courts, and election officials from both parties.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Senate Republicans that a vote on objections would be ""the most consequential vote"" of his career, and he has been encouraging his Republican conference not to join the objections.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Wednesday became the first senator to say he would object to certifying some states' Electoral College results, forcing other Republicans to vote on whether to reject Trump's unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud or disenfranchise millions of voters.

In a series of tweets Saturday evening, Trump praised the senators' actions, falsely claimed that he won by a ""landslide"" and said, ""Our Country will love them for it!""

Trump has lashed out at members of his party who have failed to back up his outlandish claims of fraud, and he has called for the resignation of local GOP officials who have refused to overturn their states' results. Trump has not yet commented on the latest development, but his campaign tweeted a message of thanks to the senators."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said they are studying the case of a 32-year-old female doctor who was hospitalized after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

The doctor, whose name has not been released, was admitted to the intensive care unit of a public hospital in the northern state of Nuevo Leon after she experienced seizures, difficulty breathing and a skin rash.

“The initial diagnosis is encephalomyelitis,” the Health Ministry said in a statement released on Friday night. Encephalomyelitis is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

The ministry added that the doctor has a history of allergic reactions and said that there is no evidence from clinical trials that anyone has developed an inflammation of the brain after the vaccine’s application.

Pfizer and BioNTech could not immediately be reached for comment.

"Syria blasts US for sanctions, following UN expert's remarks",98,koxhpn,https://apnews.com/article/business-global-trade-bashar-assad-middle-east-financial-markets-24f76dff58249d74cc8d752132476c46,7,1609623001.0,,"BEIRUT (AP) — Syria on Saturday lambasted the U.S. government for sanctions it has imposed on Damascus, following a U.N. special rapporteur’s statement that called on Washington to remove unilateral sanctions against the war-torn country.

The Syrian Foreign Ministry described U.S. sanctions against the country as equal to “crimes against humanity” that impact the life of normal citizens as the country looks to rebuild after 10 years of civil war.

The U.S. has imposed sanctions for years on Syrian President Bashar Assad and a number of his top officials. Measures that went into effect in June will also allow U.S. authorities to target foreign companies that do business with some Syrian state institutions.

On Tuesday, U.N. human rights expert Alena Douhan called on the United States to lift its unilateral sanctions “which may inhibit rebuilding of Syria’s civilian infrastructure” destroyed by the conflict that has killed about half a million people.

Douhan, who is the U.N. special rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights, said American sanctions “violate the human rights of the Syrian people.”

Speaking on Wednesday, the U.S. Special Envoy for Syria Joel Rayburn rejected Douhan’s statement as “misguided and false.”

He said that the blame for Syria’s economic situation and humanitarian crisis falls on “Assad’s brutal war against the Syrian people, not on U.S. sanctions.”

Areas under government control in Syria have been suffering from a severe shortage of bread and fuel that Damascus blames on Washington. In some areas, people have to stand in line for hours outside bakeries to get bread, the main staple in the country.

Alongside being hit hard by sanctions, the Syrian economy has suffered for many years because of widespread corruption and recently as a result of a severe economic and financial crisis in neighboring Lebanon."
Distillers that made hand sanitizer won't face federal fine,25,kojjlj,https://apnews.com/article/business-health-vancouver-coronavirus-pandemic-d297cf839e8fb6e28a18fa12b13efc3d,4,1609565401.0,,"VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) — Vancouver’s Quartz Mountain Distillers was surprised Wednesday by a $14,060 fine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out Thursday evening that the fee is not being enforced.

Owner Randy Kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in April. The family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the Columbian reported .

All distillers that made hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic were facing the fine.

The Department of Health & Human Services on Thursday announced it was directing the FDA not to enforce the fine after the FDA received heavy backlash on social media.

“Small businesses who stepped up to fight COVID-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so,” the Department of Health & Human Services said on Twitter.

Kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. If the company was forced to pay it, he would have to closed down.

“I’d just have to lock the door and walk away,” he said.

Quartz Mountain Distillers was about to begin distilling vodka in March when the pandemic hit, and it began producing hand sanitizer instead. By April, the company had made over 800 bottles of sanitizer."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress on Friday overrode President Donald Trump’s veto of a defense policy bill, a first by lawmakers since he took office nearly four years ago, ensuring that the measure becomes law.

In an extraordinary New Year’s Day session, the Republican-controlled Senate easily turned aside the veto, dismissing Trump’s objections to the $740 billion bill and handing him a stinging rebuke just weeks before he leaves the White House.

Trump lashed out on Twitter, saying the Senate missed an opportunity to eliminate protections for social media platforms that he said give “unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!″

Trump also slammed lawmakers for rejecting his call to increase COVID-19 relief payments to $2,000: “Not fair, or smart!″

The 81-13 vote in the Senate on the widely popular defense bill followed an earlier 322-87 override vote in the House. The bill affirms a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and guides defense policy, cementing decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, personnel policy and other military goals.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the “sweeping and overwhelmingly bipartisan votes” in the House and Senate “delivered a resounding rebuke to President Trump’s reckless assault on America’s military and national security.″

Trump’s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, “would have hurt the health, financial security and safety of our servicemembers, their families, our veterans and our allies and partners worldwide,″ Pelosi said. “Instead of keeping Americans safe, the president continues to use his final moments in office to sow chaos and undermine our security.″

The defense bill, which now has the force of law, “looks after our brave men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform,″ said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “But it’s also a tremendous opportunity: to direct our national security priorities to reflect the resolve of the American people and the evolving threats to their safety, at home and abroad. It’s our chance to ensure we keep pace with competitors like Russia and China.″

The Senate override was delayed after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., objected to moving ahead until McConnell allowed a vote on the Trump-backed plan to boost COVID relief payments to $2,000. McConnell did not allow that vote; instead he used his parliamentary power to set a vote limiting debate on the defense measure, overcoming a filibuster threat by Sanders and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.

Without a bipartisan agreement, a vote on the bill could have been delayed until Saturday night. Lawmakers, however, agreed to an immediate roll call Friday once the filibuster threat was stopped.

Trump vetoed the defense measure last week, saying it failed to limit Twitter and other social media companies he claimed were biased against him during his failed reelection campaign. Trump also opposed language that allows for the renaming of military bases that honor Confederate leaders.

Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a close Trump ally, hailed the override vote.

“Today, the Senate sent a strong message of support to our troops,″ Inhofe said. “Not only does this bill give our service members and their families the resources they need, but it also makes our nation more secure — pushing back against China and Russia (and) strengthening our cyber defenses.″

Trump has succeeded throughout his four-year term in enforcing party discipline in Congress, with few Republicans willing to publicly oppose him. The bipartisan overrides on the defense bill showed the limits of Trump’s influence in the final weeks of his term.

Earlier this week, 130 House Republicans voted against the Trump-backed COVID relief checks, with many arguing they were unnecessary and would increase the federal budget deficit. The Democratic-controlled House approved the larger payments, but the plan fizzled in the Senate amid opposition from McConnell and other Republicans, another sign of Trump’s fading hold over Congress.

Only seven GOP senators voted with Trump to oppose the defense bill override. Forty Republicans — including the entire GOP leadership — voted for the override, along with 41 Democrats. Sanders and five other liberals who opposed the defense bill also voted against the override.

Besides his concerns about social media and military base names, Trump also complained that the bill restricted his ability to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan and Germany. The measure requires the Pentagon to submit reports certifying that the proposed withdrawals would not jeopardize U.S. national security.

Trump has vetoed eight other bills, but those were all sustained because supporters did not gain the two-thirds vote needed in each chamber for the bills to become law without Trump’s signature.

Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Trump’s Dec. 23 veto a “parting gift” to Russian President Vladimir Putin “and a lump of coal for our troops. Donald Trump is showing more devotion to Confederate base names than to the men and women who defend our nation.”"
"Danny Masterson harassment suit must go through Scientology mediation, judge rules",187,koed76,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/danny-masterson-harassment-suit-must-go-through-scientology-mediation-judge-n1252635,17,1609548418.0,,"LOS ANGELES — The stalking and intimidation cases brought by four women who have accused TV actor Danny Masterson of rape must now go through mediation within the Church of Scientology, a Los Angeles judge ruled Wednesday.

The ruling comes just days before Masterson's scheduled arraignment on three charges of rape between 2001 and 2003. In early November, that hearing was set for Jan 6.

On Wednesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Steven Kleifield ruled that the harassment complaint from Chrissie Carnell Bixler, her husband, musician Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Marie Bobette Riales and two Jane Does must be settled by the Church in ""religious arbitration,"" since an arbitration agreement already exists among the parties that compels disputes to be handled by the Church of Scientology.

The August 2019 suit alleged the plaintiffs had been stalked and intimidated by the church's agents after going to the police to report the allegations. Carnell Bixler has alleged that Masterson repeatedly sexually assaulted her while they were dating in 2001 and 2002. Bixler-Zavala alleged that ""agents of the defendants"" assaulted them by means including poisoning their dogs, assaults using automobiles and harassing phone calls.

Jane Doe #1 also alleged harassment by property damage, threats of violence, assaults and sexual harassment as retribution for reporting her alleged rape to police. Jane Doe #2 was also part of the lawsuit that alleged infliction of emotional distress, stalking and invasion of privacy by the defendants.

Masterson's attorney Andrew Brettler said, ""This was absolutely the correct result. We look forward to arbitrating the claims, as the Court directed.""

A decision was not made on the claims by Bobette Riales, who was not a member of the church and thus not subject to the arbitration agreement.

A status conference on the arbitration was set by the court for June 30."

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina education officials recently estimated that educators can’t account for about 10,000 to 15,000 public school students this school year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lawmakers and educators worry more students are falling through cracks in the system than is presently known, as the coronavirus pandemic upends students’ learning plans and keeps some out of virtual or physical classrooms.

David Stegall, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction’s deputy superintendent of innovation, told lawmakers earlier this month that a survey the state conducted of some districts concluded that the whereabouts of about 0.7% to 1% of the state’s 1.5 million K-12 public school students are unknown.

This happens when a school has lost contact with a student, often because the student dropped out without alerting the school or moved elsewhere without the parent notifying the school or responding to repeated requests to get their kid back in class.

If a student misses at least 10 consecutive days of school in North Carolina, they are typically unenrolled, and the school works to account for them. The education department said in a statement that “unaccounted for” doesn’t necessarily mean the school doesn’t know where a student is or that the student is in danger.

North Carolina has long kept track of enrollment and attendance numbers but has no database for counting the number of students who educators can’t account for. Republicans and Democrats on the Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee asked the department to provide the information and now worry the estimates grossly understate the scope of the problem.

Rep. Craig Horn, a Republican from Union, said he heard reports in his district and elsewhere earlier this year that upward of 1 in 5 students could not be found or had parents who didn’t inform the district that their child moved and enrolled elsewhere. He believes that number has fallen slightly but remains nowhere close to the state’s claims.

“I talk to superintendents, principals and teachers across this state, and I’m hearing numbers significantly higher than 1%,” Horn said. “I’m hearing numbers going from 8% to 14%. I just find it very difficult to believe that if we had 20-25% students missing in May that now we only have .7%. I’m sorry. It just doesn’t ring right.”

In the Dec. 1 hearing with members of Horn’s committee, Stegall said he was “relieved” the numbers weren’t higher and noted the state’s efforts to track people down.

“Our schools are continually working with social workers, truancy officers, their counselors to track down every student,” Stegall said. “And sometimes, that means not only home visits but visiting neighbors, friends, family and trying to find out where they may be.”

Erik Naglee, a principal at Page High School in Greensboro, has worked to support the roughly 1,800 students at his school who were learning entirely online during the two fall quarters this year. He said several dozen students remain unaccounted for and dozens don’t have access to a computer or the Internet, disrupting their ability to show up to class even when they’re accounted for.

Three or four buses serve as WiFi hotspots in some of the community’s lowest-income neighborhoods, but that is only helpful to those who already have devices at their disposal. Naglee and fellow administrations spent a weekend earlier this month tracking down seniors to give them hard copies of learning materials and help them remain on course to graduate.

Before the pandemic, an average of 21% students were failing at least one class. During the first quarter of classes this academic year, however, 53% students had at least one class they were failing.

“The gap will continue to widen and has widened during this time,” Naglee said. “Our students that were struggling already are struggling even more during this time. That’s very hard to address.”

State Rep. Ashton Clemmons previously worked as a local elementary school principal for eight years and has three children enrolled in public school. The Democrat from Guilford questions the accuracy of the state’s estimates and wants the education department to adopt a broader definition of “unaccounted for” that also factors in students who are technically enrolled but haven’t been able to learn and keep in contact with their teachers during the pandemic.

“Signing in one time doesn’t mean you’re accounted for from my perspective,” Clemmons said.

Secret Service making changes to presidential detail amid concerns current members are aligned with Trump: report,126,knk2tn,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/532177-secret-service-making-changes-to-presidential-detail-amid-concerns,15,1609422364.0,,"The Secret Service is planning to add a number of agents that previously worked with President-elect Joe Biden Joe BidenHouse Democrat touts resolution to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress Science denialism in the new administration Jill Biden to offer input on helping reunite separated immigrant families: report MORE when he served as vice president to his presidential detail in the coming weeks, The Washington Post reported.

While it’s not unusual for staffing changes to be made to the presidential detail when a new administration assumes office, the moves come as allies of the incoming president have expressed concerns about how some agents may align with President Trump Donald TrumpFBI says California extremist may have targeted Newsom House Democrat touts resolution to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress Facebook to dial back political content on platform MORE, the Post noted.

The Secret Service has faced scrutiny in recent months following reports that some agents were told by members of the presidential detail to forgo masks when around Trump. The office also attracted attention in the past year after it allowed Anthony Ornato, who previously headed up the current administration's detail, to serve as a political adviser in the White House.

Catherine Milhoan, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement to The Hill that the office “remains steadfastly dedicated to a standard of excellence in those operations, wholly apolitically and unaffiliated with the political parties of protectees.”

“As a matter of practice and due to operational security, the agency does not comment on protective operations inclusive of internal decisions on agency assignments,” she added.

According to the Post, Darryl Volpicelli and Brian McDonough are among the supervisory agents that served in the previous administration that are expected to soon be added to Biden’s detail. Volpicelli will reportedly serve as second-in-command of the team, and McDonough we be a senior detail supervisor.

David Cho, who helped lead the protective detail during the current administration, will also reportedly help lead the presidential detail for the incoming administration.

A former Secret Service executive told the Post it’s “smart to give the incoming president the comfort of the familiar.”

“You want him to be with people he knows and trusts, and who also know how he operates,” they added.

"GOP senator to object to Electoral College results, forcing Congress to vote on overturning Biden's win",68,kndete,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/gop-senator-object-electoral-college-results-forcing-congress-vote-overturning-n1252546,49,1609399214.0,,"Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced Wednesday that he would object to the certification of some states' Electoral College results on Jan. 6, a move that will force his fellow Republicans to vote on whether to reject President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claims of massive voter fraud in this year's election or disenfranchise millions of voters.

While numerous Republican House members are expected to object to the Electoral College results from several swing states during Congress' certification of the votes next week, Hawley is the first senator to commit to doing so. The announcement is significant because under congressional rules, a written objection that is endorsed by both a House member and a senator is needed to force Congress to consider an objection.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ripped Hawley's announcement in remarks on the Senate floor.

“The effort by the sitting president of the United States to overturn the results is patently undemocratic,"" Schumer said. ""The effort by others to amplify and burnish his ludicrous claims of fraud is equally revolting. This is America. We have elections. We have results. We make arguments based on fact and reason — not conspiracy and fantasy.""

The objections from GOP members are highly unlikely to succeed. For one to be sustained and a state's presidential vote thrown out, a majority in each chamber has to vote to agree to the objection. The Democrats hold a majority in the House, and while Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate, a number of moderate Republicans have already said they would not vote to toss out a state's votes.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had privately urged Republican senators not to challenge the vote because it could put some vulnerable Republicans at odds with fervent Trump supporters.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., shrugged off Hawley's announcement, telling reporters she has ""no doubt that on next Wednesday, a week from today, that Joe Biden will be confirmed by the acceptance of the vote of the Electoral College as the 46th president of the United States.""

Biden’s incoming White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, also showed no concern during a virtual briefing with reporters.

“Congress will certify the results of this election as they do every four years,” Psaki said, adding: “This is merely a formality. It certainly should be treated as such.""

Despite the long-shot nature of the challenge, Hawley's objection could lead to a long day; Congress could debate for up to two hours on objections to each states' results before members vote.

Hawley, who is considered a possible presidential candidate in 2024, did not say how many states' votes he would object to, but he suggested that Pennsylvania would be one of them.

“I cannot vote to certify the Electoral College results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws,"" Hawley said in a statement, echoing a claim made repeatedly by the president and rejected repeatedly by state and federal courts.

Millions of voters concerned about election integrity deserve to be heard. I will object on January 6 on their behalf pic.twitter.com/kTaaPPJGHE — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) December 30, 2020

Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, blasted Hawley's announcement as ""another baseless attempt by Trump’s enablers to undermine the will of the people.""

""Pennsylvania’s election was secure, legal & fair. Our electoral votes have been cast for Joe Biden & Kamala Harris,"" he wrote in a pair of tweets, adding that ""people should know that any senator making declarations about challenging Pennsylvania’s election result is performing political theater for Donald Trump, not following any facts or laws.""

Outgoing Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va., slammed Hawley and members of their party in the House who planned to mount objections.

""All this is based on disinformation and conspiracy theories,"" Riggleman said in an interview with MSNBC's Kasie Hunt, blasting his colleagues for ""throwing away federalism"" for ""really a baseline of disinformation and ridiculousness.""

""When does a scam become a coup?"" he asked, adding, ""You inject disinformation into the constituents and then use that disinformation as a rationalization to protest this. It's unbelievable, and it's how disinformation works, right?""

""A lot of people are fundraising off of fantasy, and it comes a time you have to get more and more provocative to raise those funds,"" Riggleman continued. Hawley, he speculated, ""is looking for a higher office. Maybe he's positioning for 2024. This is all just political. Has nothing to do on rule of law, has nothing to do on what's good for this country. It has to do with what's good for the individual"" and ""assuaging the Twitter mobs or assuaging a certain specific part of your electorate instead of doing what's right, and that's serving your country based on the Constitution.""

In his statement, Hawley tried to portray the extraordinary move as business as usual, saying, ""I will follow the same practice Democrat members of Congress have in years past,"" pointing to the 2004 and 2016 elections.

During the certification of the 2016 election results, several House Democrats attempted to object to the vote in a number of states, but they were ruled out of order by then-Vice President Biden, who noted that no senators had joined in their objections.

After the 2004 election, then-Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. and Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, objected to Ohio's votes, charging there had been voter suppression because of long lines and missing voting machines in minority areas in the state.

Then-Rep. Candice Miller, R-Mich., said those complaints were “outrage based on fantasy conspiracies” while the Bush White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, said, “It is time to move forward and not engage in conspiracy theories or partisan politics of this nature.”

The measure failed in the Senate by a vote of 74-1 and in the House by a vote of 267-31.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., took a dark view of Hawley's actions in an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell.

“Josh Hawley and anyone who supports his effort are engaged in the attempted overthrow of democracy,"" Murphy said. ""There is no evidence that there was any fraud. Sen. Hawley apparently believes that if a Democrat wins the presidential race, it must be illegitimate by definition, even absent any actual evidence of misbehavior.""

Last week, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, cautioned his fellow Republicans against making an objection on Jan. 6.

""I think the thing they got to remember is, it’s just not going anywhere. I mean in the Senate, it would go down like a shot dog,"" Thune told reporters. ""I just don't think that it makes a lot of sense to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be,” he added.

Trump responded to him a short time later on Twitter, mocking Thune as a ""RINO"" — an acronym for Republican in name only — and suggesting he ""should just let it play out. South Dakota doesn’t like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!"""
Trump pardon of Blackwater Iraq contractors violates international law - UN,449,kncvnn,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-blackwater-un/trump-pardon-of-blackwater-iraq-contractors-violates-international-law-un-idUSKBN294108?il=0,112,1609397598.0,,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s pardon of four American men convicted of killing Iraqi civilians while working as contractors in 2007 violated U.S. obligations under international law, U.N. human rights experts said on Wednesday.

Nicholas Slatten was convicted of first-degree murder, while Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were convicted of voluntary and attempted manslaughter, over the incident in which U.S. contractors opened fire in busy traffic in a Baghdad square and killed 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians.

The four contractors, who worked for the private security firm Blackwater owned by the brother of Trump’s education secretary, were included in a wave of pre-Christmas pardons announced by the White House.

“Pardoning the Blackwater contractors is an affront to justice and to the victims of the Nisour Square massacre and their families,” said Jelena Aparac, chair of the U.N. working group on the use of mercenaries, said in a statement.

The Geneva Conventions oblige states to hold war criminals accountable for their crimes, even when they act as private security contractors, the U.N. experts said.

“These pardons violate U.S. obligations under international law and more broadly undermine humanitarian law and human rights at a global level.”

By allowing private security contractors to “operate with impunity in armed conflicts”, states will be emboldened to circumvent their obligations under humanitarian law, they said.

The pardons were strongly criticised by many in the United States. General David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, respectively commander of U.S. forces and U.S. ambassador in Iraq at the time of the incident, called Trump’s pardons “hugely damaging, an action that tells the world that Americans abroad can commit the most heinous crimes with impunity”.

In a statement announcing the pardons, the White House said the move was “broadly supported by the public” and backed by a number of Republican lawmakers."

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Luke Letlow, Louisiana’s incoming Republican member of the U.S. House, died Tuesday night from complications related to COVID-19 only days before he would have been sworn into office. He was 41.

Letlow spokesman Andrew Bautsch confirmed the congressman-elect’s death at Ochsner-LSU Health Shreveport.

“The family appreciates the numerous prayers and support over the past days but asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time,” Bautsch said in a statement. “A statement from the family along with funeral arrangements will be announced at a later time.”

Louisiana’s eight-member congressional delegation called Letlow’s death devastating.

“Luke had such a positive spirit, and a tremendously bright future ahead of him. He was looking forward to serving the people of Louisiana in Congress, and we were excited to welcome him to our delegation where he was ready to make an even greater impact on our state and our nation,” they said in a statement.

The state’s newest congressman, set to take office in January, was admitted to a Monroe hospital on Dec. 19 after testing positive for the coronavirus disease. He was later transferred to the Shreveport facility and placed in intensive care.

Dr. G.E. Ghali, of LSU Health Shreveport, told The Advocate that Letlow didn’t have any underlying health conditions that would have placed him at greater risk to COVID-19.

Letlow, from the small town of Start in Richland Parish, was elected in a December runoff election for the sprawling 5th District U.S. House seat representing central and northeastern regions of the state, including the cities of Monroe and Alexandria.

He was to fill the seat being vacated by his boss, Republican Ralph Abraham. Letlow had been Abraham’s chief of staff and ran with Abraham’s backing for the job.

Gov. John Bel Edwards urged people to pray for Letlow’s family.

“COVID-19 has taken Congressman-elect Letlow from us far too soon,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “I am heartbroken that he will not be able to serve our people as a U.S. representative, but I am even more devastated for his loving family.”

Letlow is survived by his wife, Julia Barnhill Letlow, and two children.

U.S. House leaders offered their condolences Tuesday night.

“May it be a comfort to Luke’s wife Julia and their children Jeremiah and Jacqueline that so many mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said: “Our hearts break tonight as we process the news of Congressman-elect Luke Letlow’s passing.”

Before working for Abraham, Letlow had worked for former Gov. Bobby Jindal’s administration. Jindal’s one-time chief of staff, Timmy Teepell, described Letlow on Twitter as “a good man with a kind heart and a passion to serve. He loved Louisiana and his family. He was a brother and I’m heart broken he’s gone.”

Letlow is one of more than 7,000 people in Louisiana who have died from COVID-19 since March, according to data from the state health department.

When he announced his positive test for COVID-19, Letlow joined a list of Louisiana officials who have contracted the coronavirus since the pandemic began, including U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, Attorney General Jeff Landry, Treasurer John Schroder, U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson and U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond.

Cassidy, a Republican and doctor who tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this year and has since recovered, posted in a Twitter video: “It just, just, just, just brings home COVID can kill. For most folks it doesn’t, but it truly can. So, as you remember Luke, his widow, his children in your prayers, remember as well to be careful with COVID.”

"Mitch McConnell Ties $2,000 Covid-19 Relief Checks To Repeal Of Section 230; Democrats Call It A “Poison Pill”",21,kmww5u,https://deadline.com/2020/12/mitch-mcconnell-ties-2000-covid-19-relief-checks-to-repeal-of-section-230-democrats-call-it-a-poison-pill-1234662600/,11,1609338676.0,,"Followed by a staffer holding a bag, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., right, leaves the Capitol for the day.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) introduced a bill that ties $2,000-per-person Covid-19 relief checks to a repeal of Section 230, the provision of a 1996 law that protects social media platforms from liability for the way that they moderate third party content.

In doing so, McConnell has likely added a “poison pill” to the effort to increase the Covid-19 relief payments from the current $600.

Increasing numbers of Republicans have joined with Democrats in support of the $2,000 checks, after President Donald Trump called for them to be increased, putting McConnell on the spot to take some sort of action in the next week.

But by tying the payments to another Trump priority — the repeal of Section 230 — McConnell is likely making the package unsuitable to a number of Democrats in the Senate and the House. Although politicians of both parties have expressed a desire to modify Section 230, it’s a whole other matter to repeal it entirely.

Related Story 'GMA' Co-Host Michael Strahan Tests Positive For Covid-19; He Is ""Feeling Well,"" Says George Stephanopoulos

The tech industry has long argued that repealing Section 230 would lead to an avalanche of litigation.

In an op ed in USA Today last week, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Chris Cox, director at the internet trade association NetChoice, wrote that repealing Section 230 “would also force every website hosting user content to create round-the-clock legal and editorial review teams staffed with hundreds or thousands of people to continually monitor every message, video, photo, and blog. Alternatively, websites would face exorbitant legal damages at every turn. That is not realistic.”

McConnell’s bill also sets up a bipartisan committee to investigate election fraud, as Trump has refused to concede the race and has made unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him. The proposed committee would examine the use of such things as absentee ballots but would not address some of Democrats’ concerns of voter suppression.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) said on CNN that what McConnell was doing was saying, “I am going to throw in a few poison pills in here to see if we can discourage people from voting for this.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that McConnell was adding “unrelated, partisan provisions that will do absolutely nothing to help struggling families across the country.” Schumer said McConnell’s bill “will not pass the House and cannot become law – any move like this by Sen. McConnell would a blatant attempt to deprive Americans of a $2,000 survival check.”

The House voted overwhelmingly on Monday to increase the payments to $2,000.

Earlier, McConnell blocked an effort by Schumer to pass the increased payments by unanimous consent.

Trump, meanwhile, linked to a story on McConnell’s action and wrote, “Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 – Don’t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don’t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!” But Trump has not explicitly demanded that a repeal of Section 230 be linked to the increased payments.

Trump targeted Section 230 after Twitter started putting fact-checking labels on his tweets, while he and other Republicans have groused that social media platforms have a bias against conservative viewpoints. But they have largely relied on anecdotal evidence, while Silicon Valley CEOs, in congressional hearings, have defended their content moderation and denied that there is systemic bias. Democrats, meanwhile, want social media giants like Facebook and YouTube to do more to curb misinformation, especially around the election and the coronavirus pandemic."

As The Guardian reported, the state-run statistics agency Rosstat said the total number of deaths between January and November from all causes had jumped by 229,700 when compared with the previous year.

“More than 81 percent of this increase in mortality over this period is due to COVID,” said Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova, which would indicated a death toll of more than 186,000 Russians, The Guardian reported. The update means Russia has the third-highest number of fatalities in the world, surpassed only by the U.S. and Brazil.

Russian officials have so far confirmed more than 3 million cases and only 55,265 deaths, The Guardian noted, a number far lower than other large impacted countries.

The newspaper reported that despite rising coronavirus numbers, the Russian government is reluctant to order another national lockdown. In his end-of-year conference, Putin said, ""If we follow the rules and demands of health regulators, then we do not need any lockdowns.""

Moscow reportedly hopes to contain the virus through its vaccination program launched this month. Russia was the first country in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine. The Russian-made vaccine, dubbed Sputnik V, showed promising results but was criticized by medical journals for having short clinical trials.

Earlier in December, Putin, 68, said he would delay taking the vaccine due to the lack of research done on people over 60. However the vaccine was approved for people over 60 this past weekend, The Guardian reported."

He tweeted on Tuesday afternoon: ""Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. ""

Driving the news: McConnell did not explain why he objected to Schumer's request to fast-track the bill, but noted that President Trump has demanded Congress act on repealing liability protections for tech companies and election-related reforms, in addition to the stimulus checks.

""Those are the three important subjects the president has linked together. This week, the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,"" McConnell said in a possible nod to a future package.

The state of play: The House voted 275-134 to pass the $2,000 direct payments bill on Tuesday, with 44 Republicans joining the majority of Democrats.

Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and David Perdue, the two senators running for re-election in the Jan. 5 runoff, both came out in support of the $2,000 checks earlier on Tuesday.

Republican Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.) have also publicly said they will support the measure.

12 Republicans in total are needed to reach the 60-vote threshold to pass the bill if all Senate Democrats vote in favor, as expected.

What to watch: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has pledged to delay the Senate's plans to override Trump's veto of a crucial defense-spending package unless McConnell holds a full recorded vote on the direct payments measure — keeping the Senate in session during the holiday week and disrupting Loeffler and Perdue's campaign plans.

What they're saying: ""A vast majority of the public, Republican and Democrat, strongly support $2,000 checks. An overwhelming bipartisan majority in the House supports $2,000 checks. Senate Democrats strongly support $2,000 checks. Even President Trump supports $2,000 checks,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor."
Child labor in palm oil industry tied to Girl Scout cookies,291,kmgd1v,https://apnews.com/article/palm-oil-forests-indonesia-scouts-83b01f2789e9489569960da63b2741c4,13,1609284212.0,,"Child labor in palm oil industry tied to Girl Scout cookies

They are two young girls from two very different worlds, linked by a global industry that exploits an army of children.

Olivia Chaffin, a Girl Scout in rural Tennessee, was a top cookie seller in her troop when she first heard rainforests were being destroyed to make way for ever-expanding palm oil plantations. On one of those plantations a continent away, 10-year-old Ima helped harvest the fruit that makes its way into a dizzying array of products sold by leading Western food and cosmetics brands.

Ima is among the estimated tens of thousands of children working alongside their parents in Indonesia and Malaysia, which supply 85% of the world’s most consumed vegetable oil. An Associated Press investigation found most earn little or no pay and are routinely exposed to toxic chemicals and other dangerous conditions. Some never go to school or learn to read and write. Others are smuggled across borders and left vulnerable to trafficking or sexual abuse. Many live in limbo with no citizenship and fear being swept up in police raids and thrown into detention.

The AP used U.S. Customs records and the most recently published data from producers, traders and buyers to trace the fruits of their labor from the processing mills where palm kernels were crushed to the supply chains of many popular kids’ cereals, candies and ice creams sold by Nestle, Unilever, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo and many other leading food companies, including Ferrero – one of the two makers of Girl Scout cookies.

Olivia, who earned a badge for selling more than 600 boxes of cookies, had spotted palm oil as an ingredient on the back of one of her packages but was relieved to see a green tree logo next to the words “certified sustainable.” She assumed that meant her Thin Mints and Tagalongs weren’t harming rainforests, orangutans or those harvesting the orange-red palm fruit.

But later, the whip-smart 11-year-old saw the word “mixed” in all caps on the label and turned to the internet, quickly learning that it meant exactly what she feared: Sustainable palm oil had been blended with oil from unsustainable sources. To her, that meant the cookies she was peddling were tainted.

Thousands of miles away in Indonesia, Ima led her class in math and dreamed of becoming a doctor. Then one day her father made her quit school because he needed help meeting the high company targets on the palm oil plantation where she was born. Instead of attending fourth grade, she squatted in the unrelenting heat, snatching up the loose kernels littering the ground and knowing if she missed even one, her family’s pay would be cut.

She sometimes worked 12 hours a day, wearing only flip flops and no gloves, crying when the fruit’s razor-sharp spikes bloodied her hands or when scorpions stung her fingers. The loads she carried, sometimes so heavy she would lose her footing, went to one of the very mills feeding into the supply chain of Olivia’s cookies.

“I am dreaming one day I can go back to school,” she told the AP, tears rolling down her cheeks.

Child labor has long been a dark stain on the $65 billion global palm oil industry. Though often denied or minimized as kids simply helping their families on weekends or after school, it has been identified as a problem by rights groups, the United Nations and the U.S. government.

Scenes of a child gathering palm kernels.

With little or no access to daycare, some young children follow their parents to the fields, where they come into contact with fertilizers and some pesticides that are banned in other countries. As they grow older, they push wheelbarrows heaped with fruit two or three times their weight. Some weed and prune the trees barefoot, while teen boys may harvest bunches large enough to crush them, slicing the fruit from lofty branches with sickle blades attached to long poles.

In some cases, an entire family may earn less in a day than a $5 box of Girl Scout Do-si-dos.

“For 100 years, families have been stuck in a cycle of poverty and they know nothing else than work on a palm oil plantation,” said Kartika Manurung, who has published reports detailing labor issues on Indonesian plantations. “When I … ask the kids what they want to be when they grow up, some of the girls say, ‘I want to be the wife of a palm oil worker.’”

The AP’s investigation into child labor is part of a broader in-depth look at the industry that also exposed rape , forced labor, trafficking and slavery. Reporters crisscrossed Malaysia and Indonesia, speaking to more than 130 current and former workers – some two dozen of them child laborers – at nearly 25 companies. Their locations are not being disclosed and only partial names or nicknames are being used due to fears of retribution.

The AP found children working on plantations and corroborated accounts of abuse, whenever possible, by reviewing police reports and legal documents. Reporters also interviewed more than 100 activists, teachers, union leaders, government officials, researchers, lawyers and clergy, including some who helped victims of trafficking or sexual assault.

Indonesian government officials said they do not know how many children work in the country’s massive palm oil industry, either full or part time. But the U.N.’s International Labor Organization has estimated 1.5 million children between 10 and 17 years old labor in its agricultural sector. Palm oil is one of the largest crops, employing some 16 million people.

In much smaller neighboring Malaysia, a newly released government report estimated more than 33,000 children work in the industry there, many under hazardous conditions – with nearly half of them between the ages of 5 and 11. The study was conducted in 2018 after the country was slammed by the U.S. government over the use of child labor, and it did not directly address the large number of migrant children without documents hidden on many plantations in its eastern states, some of whom have never seen the inside of a classroom.

Many producers, Western buyers and banks belong to the 4,000-member Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a global not-for-profit organization that provides a green stamp of approval to those committed to supplying, sourcing, financing or using palm oil that’s been certified as ethically sourced.

The RSPO has a system in place to address grievances, including labor abuse allegations. But of the nearly 100 complaints listed on its case tracker for the two Southeast Asian countries in the last decade, only a handful have mentioned children.

“It is an issue, and we know it’s an issue,” said Dan Strechay, the RSPO’s global outreach and engagement director, adding that the organization has started working with UNICEF and others to educate members about what constitutes child labor.

Strechay said many parents in Indonesia and Malaysia believe it’s the “cultural norm” for their kids to work alongside family members, even if it means pulling them out of school. “And that’s not OK,” he said.

Palm oil is contained in roughly half the products on supermarket shelves and in almost three out of every four cosmetic brands, though that can be hard to discern since it appears on labels under more than 200 different names.

And in a world where more and more consumers are demanding to know the provenance of the raw materials in the products they purchase, many companies are quick to issue assurances that they are committed to “sustainable” sourcing. But supply chains often are murky – especially in the palm oil industry – and developing countries that produce commodities in large volumes cheaply often do so by disregarding the environment and minimizing labor costs.

Most people take words like “organic,” “fair trade” and “sustainable” at face value. But not Olivia. She became increasingly worried about palm oil, rifling through the kitchen cupboards in her family’s century-old farmhouse in Jonesborough, Tennessee, to inspect the ingredients printed on cans and wrappers. Then she began digging through her shampoos and lotions, trying to make sense of the scientific-sounding names she saw there.

Now 14, Olivia has fired letters off to the head of Girl Scouts of the USA, demanding answers about how the palm oil is sourced for the organization’s cookies. She’s started an online petition to get it removed. And she and some other members of Troop 543 have stopped selling them.

The Girl Scouts did not respond to repeated requests for comment before the AP published its findings Tuesday. But after widespread criticism on social media, the organization sent out a tweet the next day calling on its bakers and the RSPO to take action.

“I thought Girl Scouts was supposed to be about making the world a better place,” Olivia said. “But this isn’t at all making the world better.”

Many kids are introduced to palm oil soon after they’re born – it’s a primary fat in infant formula. And as they grow, it’s present in many of their favorite foods: It’s in their Pop-Tarts and Cap’n Crunch cereal, Oreo cookies, KitKat candy bars, Magnum ice cream, doughnuts and even bubble gum.

“Let them enjoy it,” said Abang, a skinny 14-year-old who dropped out of the fifth grade to help his father on an Indonesian plantation and has never tasted ice cream. He has accepted his own fate, but still dreams of a better future for his little brother.

“Let me work, just me, helping my father,” Abang said. “I want my brother to go back to school. … I don’t want him in the same difficult situation like me.”

Though many consumers aren’t familiar with it, palm oil became ubiquitous nearly two decades ago after warnings about health risks associated with trans fats. Almost overnight, food manufacturers began shifting to the highly versatile and cheap oil.

Indonesia is the world’s largest palm oil producer and, with a population of 270 million, there is no shortage of strong backs. Many laborers migrate from the poorest corners of the country to take jobs that others shun, often bringing their wives and children as helpers in order to meet impossibly high daily quotas.

Others have been living on the same plantations for generations, creating a built-in workforce – when one harvester retires or dies, another in the family takes his place to hold onto company-subsidized housing, which often is a dilapidated shack with no running water and sometimes only limited electricity.

It’s a cycle that 15-year-old Jo was trying to break. Even though he had to help his family in the fields each day, heaving palm fruits high over his head and lobbing them onto trucks, his parents let him keep $6 a month to cover school fees so he could attend morning classes.

“I am determined to finish high school to find a job outside the plantation,” said Jo, who toiled alongside his mother, father and grandfather. “My parents are very poor. Why should I follow my parents?”

But for many migrant children in neighboring Malaysia – which relies almost entirely on foreign workers to fill constant labor shortages – the hurdles to a brighter life seem insurmountable.

Male harvesters technically are not allowed to bring their families to plantations on Borneo island, which is shared by both countries. So children often follow behind, sometimes traveling alone on illicit smugglers’ routes known as “jalan tikus,” or rat roads. The perilous border crossings to the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak can take place at night, either on foot across winding jungle paths or in packed speed boats racing without lights, sometimes colliding or capsizing in the dark.

An official estimate says 80,000 children of illegal migrants, mostly from Indonesia and the Philippines, are living in Sabah alone, but some rights groups say the true number could be nearly double that. Without birth certificates and with no path to citizenship, they are essentially stateless – denied access to even the most basic rights, and at high risk of exploitation.

Migrant workers without documents are often treated “inhumanely” in Malaysia, said Soes Hindharno, an official from Indonesia’s Manpower Ministry. He said he had not received any complaints about child labor occurring in his own country, but an official from the ministry that oversees women and children’s issues acknowledged it was an area of growing concern in Indonesia.

Malaysia’s Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but Nageeb Wahab, head of the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a government-supported umbrella group, called allegations of child labor very serious and urged complaints to be reported to authorities.

Children of migrant parents grow up living in fear they will be separated from their families. They try to remain invisible to avoid attracting the ever-watchful eyes of police, with some keeping backpacks with supplies ready in case they need to flee their houses and sleep in the jungle to avoid raids.

Many never leave their guarded plantations, some so remote that workers must climb hills to search for a phone signal. And for those who dare to go out, trouble can come quickly.

Alex was 12 when he began working 10 hours a day on a small plantation with his father, hoisting fruits so heavy his aching muscles kept him awake at night. One day, he decided to sneak off to visit his favorite aunt in a nearby village. With no passport, Alex said authorities quickly found him and carted him off to a crowded immigration detention center where he was held for a month.

“There were hundreds of other people there, some my age, and also younger children, mostly with their mothers,” he said. “I was very afraid and kept thinking about how worried my mother and father must be. It made it hard to even eat or drink.”

But the biggest obstacles faced by Alex and other child workers in the two countries are lack of access to adequate, affordable education and medical care.

Some companies in Indonesia provide rudimentary elementary schooling on plantations, but children who want to continue their studies may find they have to travel too far on poor roads or that they can’t afford it. In Malaysia, the problem is even bigger: Without legal documents, tens of thousands of kids are not allowed to go to government schools at all.

It’s such an extensive problem that Indonesia has set up learning centers to help some of its children on plantations in the neighboring country, even sending in its own teachers. But with such heavy workloads on plantations, one instructor said he had to beg parents to let their sons and daughters come for even just a half-day of classes. And many children, especially those living in remote, hard-to-reach areas, still have no access to any type of education.

“Why aren’t companies playing a role in setting up schools in collaboration with the government?” asked Glorene Das, executive director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian nonprofit group concentrating on migrant issues for more than two decades. “Why are they encouraging the children to work instead?”

Medical care also is woeful, with experts saying poor nutrition and daily exposure to toxic chemicals are undermining child laborers’ health and development. Many Indonesian plantations have their own basic clinics, but access may be available only to full-time workers. Travel to a private doctor or hospital can take hours, and most families cannot afford outside care. Migrant children without documents in Malaysia have no right to health care and often are too scared to seek medical help in villages or cities – even in life-threatening emergencies.

Many young palm oil workers also have little understanding about reproductive health. Girls working on remote plantations are vulnerable to sexual abuse, and teen pregnancies and marriages are common.

Ana was just 13 when she first arrived in Malaysia, quickly learning, as she put it, that “anything can happen to the female workers there.” She said she was raped and forced to marry her attacker, but eventually managed to break free after years of abuse and return home to start a new life. Now a mother with kids of her own, she abruptly left Indonesia last year again to look for work in Malaysia.

Many children do not have the option to ever leave. They are born on plantations, work there and sometimes die there. Overgrown headstones and crosses marking graves in crude cemeteries are found on some plantations near the towering palm trees.

Others, like 48-year-old Anna’s husband, are buried in community graveyards along the Indonesian and Malaysian border. A month after the palm oil harvester’s death, Anna lovingly tended his plot at the Christian site in Sabah, crammed with the bodies of hundreds of other migrants.

She said her son, whose own newborn baby was buried in the adjacent grave, had inherited his father’s job. He is the family’s main breadwinner now.

The cycle continues.

Olivia is not the first Girl Scout to raise questions about the way palm oil makes its way into the beloved American cookies.

More than a decade ago, two girls in a Michigan troop stopped selling them because they worried palm oil’s expansion in Indonesia and Malaysia was destroying rainforests and killing endangered animals like orangutans.

After they campaigned for several years, the Girl Scouts of the USA became an affiliate member of the RSPO and agreed to start using sustainable palm oil, adding the green tree logo to its roughly 200 million boxes of cookies, which bring in nearly $800 million annually.

The RSPO was created with the best of intentions and it attempts to factor in the interests of a wide array of groups, including environmental organizations, industry leaders and banks. Its mission was not to flip a switch overnight, but to encourage the mammoth palm oil industry to evolve after years of breakneck growth and little outside oversight.

Still, for many food and cosmetic companies facing increased pressure from conscientious consumers, the RSPO’s stamp of approval has become the go-to answer when questions are raised about their commitments to sustainability.

Monitoring the millions of workers hidden beneath palms covering an area equal to roughly the size of New Zealand, however, is next to impossible.

Some women and children on remote, sprawling plantations told the AP and labor rights groups that they are ordered to hide or stay home when sustainability auditors visit. They said only the optimal, easiest-to-reach parts of a plantation are typically showcased, with poor living and working conditions in distant areas hidden from outside eyes.

“The RSPO promises sustainable palm oil. But it doesn’t mean that that palm oil is free of child labor or other abuses,” said Robin Averbeck of the Rainforest Action Network, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that has found pervasive problems on plantations, including those certified as sustainable. “It has simply become a tool for greenwashing.”

When contacted by the AP, companies reaffirmed their support of human rights for all workers, with some noting they rely on their suppliers to meet industry standards and abide by local laws. If evidence of wrongdoing is found, some said they would immediately cut ties with producers.

“We aim to prevent and address the issue of child labor wherever it occurs in our supply chain,” said Nestle, maker of KitKat candy bars. Unilever – the world’s biggest ice-cream maker, including Magnum – noted that its suppliers “must not, under any circumstance, employ individuals under the age of 15 or under the local legal minimum age for work or mandatory schooling.” There was no response from Mondelez, which owns Oreo cookies, or Cap’n Crunch parent company PepsiCo.

Consumers have their own challenges in trying to buy responsibly. Those, like Olivia, who want to make sense of where their palm oil really comes from often find themselves confused, since the dense terms used to explain what makes palm oil sustainable can sometimes raise even more questions.

Take Girls Scout cookies, for instance, which are made by two different U.S. bakers

Boxes from both are stamped with green palm logos. The maker of Olivia’s cookies, Little Brownie Bakers in Kentucky, has the word “mixed” beside the tree, meaning as little as 1 percent of the palm oil might be certified sustainable. ABC Bakers in Virginia says “credits,” which means money is going toward promoting sustainable production.

The bakers’ parent companies – Italian confectionary brand Ferrero and Canadian-based Weston Foods – would not comment on the issue of child labor, but both said they were committed to sourcing only certified sustainable palm oil.

Weston Foods, which owns ABC Bakers, would not provide any information about its palm oil suppliers, citing proprietary reasons, so the AP could not determine if its supply chain was tainted.

Palm oil, the highest-yielding vegetable oil, is an important part of the two Southeast Asian countries’ economies and the governments bristle at any form of criticism, saying the industry plays an important role in alleviating poverty.

They have banned products touted as “palm oil-free” from supermarket shelves and created slogans calling the crop “God’s gift.” And when students at an international school in Malaysia were criticized last year for staging a play questioning the industry’s effect on the environment, school administrators responded with an apology.

Back in Indonesia, Ima could give a very different classroom presentation about palm oil, but she has no chance. She continues to toil full time on the plantation alongside her family, even though her mother had promised she eventually could resume her studies.

“Sometimes my friends ask me, ‘Why did you drop out? Why are you not at school?’” Ima said, her resentment readily apparent. “‘Because I have to help my father. If you want to replace me and help my father, then I will go to school. How about that?’”

After learning about Ima, Olivia is even more determined to fight on. She had previously sent letters to her customers explaining her reasons for no longer selling Girl Scout cookies, and many responded by donating money to her Southern Appalachian troop to show support.

Now, Olivia is asking Girl Scouts across the country to band with her, saying, “The cookies deceive a lot of people. They think it’s sustainable, but it isn’t.

“I’m not just some little girl who can’t do anything about this,” she said. “Children can make change in the world. And we’re going to.”

An Associated Press investigation has found that an army of children are toiling on palm oil plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia. The vegetable oil can be found in the supply chains of popular cereals, snacks and Girl Scout cookies. (Dec. 29)

"U.S. bolsters support for Taiwan and Tibet, angering China",157,km7rv4,https://news.yahoo.com/china-says-u-stop-using-081142049.html,9,1609247616.0,,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China expressed anger on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law measures to further bolster support for Taiwan and Tibet, which had been included in a $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package.

China has watched with growing alarm as the United States has stepped up its backing for Chinese-claimed Taiwan and its criticism of Beijing's rule in remote Tibet, further straining a relationship under intense pressure over trade, human rights and other issues.

The Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 and Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 both contain language objectionable to China, including U.S. support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in United Nations bodies and regular arms sales.

On Tibet, which China has ruled with an iron fist since 1950, the act says sanctions should be put on Chinese officials who interfere in the selection of the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama's successor.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was ""resolutely opposed"" to both acts.

""The determination of the Chinese government to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests is unwavering,"" he told reporters.

The U.S. should not put the parts of the acts which ""target China"" into effect in order to avoid harming Sino-U.S. relations, he said, adding they were an interference in China's internal affairs.

In Taiwan, which China claims as its sovereign territory to be taken by force if needed, the government welcomed the U.S. move.

""The United States is an important ally of Taiwan's internationally, and a solid partner for sharing the values ​​of freedom and democracy,"" Presidential Office spokesman Xavier Chang said.

Trump, who is due to leave office on Jan. 20 after losing November's election to President-elect Joe Biden, backed down from his earlier threat to block the spending bill, which was approved by Congress last week, after he came under intense pressure from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle.

He signed it on Sunday evening.

"Leading New Texas Rebellion, Louie Gohmert Sues Mike Pence Because VP Lacks Authority to Overturn Joe Biden’s Election Win",110,klwono,https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/leading-new-texas-rebellion-louie-gohmert-sues-mike-pence-because-vp-lacks-authority-to-overturn-joe-bidens-election-win/,7,1609211165.0,,"A Texas hardliner is once again leading a post-election rebellion against the future Joe Biden presidency.

Led by Lone Star State Rep. Louie Gohmert, a coalition of outgoing President Donald Trump’s right-wing loyalists asked a federal judge on Sunday to gut a post-Reconstruction era law in order give Vice President Mike Pence the power to determine the winner of the 2020 presidential election on Jan. 6, 2021.

Gohmert’s cohorts include ex-“Kraken” plaintiff Tyler Bowyer and the Arizona Republican Party’s chairwoman Kelli Ward, whose call for Trump to #CrossTheRubicon was widely interpreted as pining for the president to establish dictatorship just like Julius Caesar did.

Through a creative reading of the 12th Amendment, Gohmert’s brigade contends the Constitution empowers Pence to ignore a statute making his work ministerial and select “competing slates of Presidential Electors.” The lawsuit, which was filed against Pence in his official capacity as vice president, is based on outright falsehoods—there are no “competing electors”—and an absurd misreading of federal law that would let the VP unilaterally decide the outcome of his own election.

Trump and his acolytes have called for Pence to block Biden’s victory by rejecting the certificates of votes in states Trump lost. Gohmert and his cohorts take this theory a giant step further, asserting that the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA) violates the Twelfth Amendment by not allowing the VP to count uncertified votes cast by Trump’s slate of “shadow electors.”

According to the lawsuit, the Vice President “may exercise the exclusive authority and sole discretion in determining which electoral votes to count for a given state, and must ignore and may not rely on any provisions of the Electoral Count Act that would limit his exclusive authority and his sole discretion to determine the count, which could include votes from the slates of Republican electors from the Contested States.”

It further contends that the Electoral Count Act “limits or eliminates [the Vice President’s] exclusive authority and sole discretion under the Twelfth Amendment to determine which slates of electors for a State, or neither, may be counted.”

These assertions are simply false. The election results in every U.S. state have already been certified and the Electoral College votes for Biden have already been cast. There is absolutely no constitutional provision allowing for states to have “competing” or “alternate” slates of electors. The “votes” those groups sent to Congress do not have any legal authority.

As Law&Crime explained in a previous post, the Twelfth Amendment only dictates that the VP, as president of the Senate, “open all the certificates” and nothing more.

In fact, the Electoral Count Act, which describes the process for counting Electoral College votes, was specifically enacted to “drain away as much power as possible from the Senate President,” according to DePaul University Law School professor Stephen A. Siegel, who specializes in legal history and constitutional law.

“With the opening of the votes, the Senate President has reached the end of his constitutional role in the presidential election process,” he wrote.

The complaint further seeks an injunction prohibiting enforcement of any ECA provision limiting Pence’s “exclusive authority and his sole discretion to determine which of two or more competing slates of electors’ votes are to be counted for President.”

U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle, an appointee of President Donald Trump will preside over the case in the Eastern District of Texas.

UC Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said Gohmert’s legal challenge “won’t work,” while national security attorney Bradley P. Moss called the lawsuit “garbage.”

Actual lawyers signed their names to this garbage (one of them uses an AOL e-mail address but I won't hold that against them). https://t.co/OM6DpLdJk5 — Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) December 28, 2020

Inside Trump and Barr’s Last-Minute Killing Spree,2,klxkad,https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-trump-and-barrs-last-minute-killing-spree,24,1609213903.0,,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

In its hurry to use its final days in power to execute federal prisoners, the administration of President Donald Trump has trampled over an array of barriers, both legal and practical, according to court records that have not been previously reported.

Officials gave public explanations for their choice of which prisoners should die that misstated key facts from the cases. They moved ahead with executions in the middle of the night. They left one prisoner strapped to the gurney while lawyers worked to remove a court order. They executed a second prisoner while an appeal was still pending, leaving the court to then dismiss the appeal as “moot” because the man was already dead. They bought drugs from a secret pharmacy that failed a quality test. They hired private executioners and paid them in cash.

The unprecedented string of executions is often attributed to Attorney General William P. Barr, and his role was instrumental: It was Barr’s signature that authorized the use of a new lethal injection drug, his quotes that trumpeted the execution announcements and his position as attorney general that holds the ultimate authority in capital cases. (Barr is resigning effective Wednesday.)

But a ProPublica review of internal government records shows that Barr did not act alone. The push to resume federal executions for the first time since 2003 long predates Barr, with groundwork beginning as far back as 2011 and accelerating after Trump took office in 2017. It could not have happened without the help of Justice Department lawyers; officials at the Bureau of Prisons; two professors who endorsed the government’s injection method; conservative Supreme Court justices who dismissed final appeals; and Trump himself, who encouraged the executions and declined to commute them.

Trump and his surrogates don’t shy away from this. Throughout the campaign they highlighted the executions as a contrast to Joe Biden’s opposition to the death penalty, reinforcing Trump’s “law and order” message. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany even invoked the execution of Daniel Lee, who fell in with skinhead groups as a teenager and renounced those beliefs decades ago, to defend Trump after he declined to disavow white supremacists in the first debate.

“The activation of the death penalty and appearance of being tough on crime played into the administration’s political strategy — the same political strategy that pushed for separating children and parents and using force against peaceful demonstrators,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that tracks executions. “An administration which is concerned about the rule of law and which respects the Constitution would have allowed court challenges to proceed and would not have attempted to carry out executions under a procedure that could be declared unlawful.”

The Justice Department has killed 10 people since July, with three more executions scheduled before Biden’s inauguration. Most every federal agency is rushing to wrap up unfinished business, cementing policy objectives in ways that will make them harder for the incoming president to unwind. But the Justice Department’s pressing forward with executions, even after the election of a new president who opposes them, is uniquely irreversible.

The White House and BOP declined to comment. In a statement, the Justice Department said: “Seeking the death penalty and carrying out capital sentences is not a political issue, nor have political considerations influenced the department’s decisions. The death penalty is a law enforcement and public safety issue, and the department is obligated to carry forward these sentences regardless of who is the president or the attorney general.”

“Death Penalty All the Way”

A slim and shrinking majority of Americans support capital punishment, according to public polling. But it remains popular with Republicans, especially white evangelicals. That coincides with the strongest base of support for Trump, who, in 1989, famously bought full-page ads in New York newspapers demanding the death penalty for five young Black and Latino men who were wrongly accused of attacking a white female jogger in Central Park.

“Death penalty all the way,” Trump said at a February 2016 campaign event in New Hampshire. “I’ve always supported the death penalty. I don’t even understand people that don’t.”

Until this year, the Justice Department hadn’t executed anyone since 2003. This long interruption was as much practical as legal. A drug that most states and the federal government used in lethal injections, a sedative called sodium pentothal, became unavailable because the sole American manufacturer stopped making it. The drug shortage thwarted the Obama administration’s plan to execute convicted murderer Jeffery Paul. States began using a similar drug called pentobarbital, and in 2011 federal prison officials observed several state executions, according to court records.

Shortly after Trump’s presidency began, his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, wanted to resolve these issues so that BOP could resume executions. Associate Deputy Attorney General Brad Weinsheimer said in a January 2020 deposition that Sessions began “conversations with staff and BOP to move forward on that.”

One of the staffers involved was Matthew Whitaker, according to Weinsheimer. Whitaker, who briefly led the Justice Department between Sessions and Barr, didn’t respond to requests for comment.

BOP made plans to use pentobarbital. But it had also become scarce as manufacturers shunned its use in executions. States resorted to using “compounding pharmacies,” which mix ingredients for custom-made drugs.

BOP planned to import powdered pentobarbital from a “foreign FDA-registered facility” but later turned to a domestic bulk manufacturer. It also hired a compounding pharmacy to create an injectable solution. The government has guarded vendor identities, since public scrutiny could pressure them to back out.

A sample of the compounding pharmacy’s solution failed a quality test by an outside lab. But according to Weinsheimer, BOP said the problem was the lab, not the compound itself, and sent a new batch to a different lab.

BOP also explored using a different drug: the opioid fentanyl. In a March 2018 memo, then-BOP Director Mark S. Inch said BOP found a fentanyl supplier but warned “there may be negative publicity associated with using a drug to which so many Americans are addicted.”

For unclear reasons, BOP planned to have the executions carried out by two private contractors, rather than government employees. The government won’t disclose the contractors’ names or profession, and it pays them in cash. “If we didn’t pay them in cash,” a BOP lawyer said in a deposition, “they probably wouldn’t participate.”

“Killing Is Not a Treatment”

BOP officials knew their new drug choice would face resistance in court; lawyers have argued that pentobarbital would flood prisoners’ lungs with froth and foam, inflicting pain and terror akin to a death by drowning. BOP worked to fend off those concerns with expert witnesses who would say the drug was humane.

Finding these experts was challenging because most doctors consider it unethical to have anything to do with executions. The American Medical Association and other professional groups prohibit any participation, including the “rendering of technical advice.”

“Doctors are experts in unkilling, we are not experts in killing,” said Dr. Joel Zivot, an anesthesiologist at Emory University who has testified that lethal injection of pentobarbital simulates death by drowning. “This is why lethal injection is so problematic. It impersonates a medical act, but it’s not about medicine at all. Killing is not a treatment. An execution chamber is not an operating room.”

The Justice Department would later claim that “BOP consulted with medical professionals” (plural). That is not exactly true. BOP engaged two expert witnesses. The first, Craig W. Lindsley, is a professor of chemistry and pharmacology at Vanderbilt University. He is not a physician or licensed care provider; he has a Ph.D., not an M.D. In May 2017, Lindsley wrote a two-page report for BOP stating that pentobarbital will take effect so rapidly the prisoner wouldn’t feel a thing. He concluded, “Of all the available options and protocols in use today, I believe this protocol to be the most humane.”

Lindsley declined to be interviewed, citing Justice Department instructions. He did not disclose his compensation, but he was hired through a contract with a consulting firm called Elite Medical Experts that the Justice Department paid $22,000 in the same month as Lindsley’s report. The company’s CEO, Dr. Burton Bentley II, did not respond to requests for comment.

BOP’s second expert witness was a medical doctor: retired California anesthesiologist Joseph F. Antognini. Antognini has said he personally opposes the death penalty as a Catholic. But he also said he believes states have a right to his advice, comparing it to criminal defendants’ right to a lawyer.

Antognini has not addressed how he squares his testimony supporting executions with his Hippocratic oath. He did raise ethical considerations when he was asked to compare lethal injection to poison gas (a comparison between methods, like the one Lindsley made). “Recommending one method of execution over another, I guess that’s an ethical issue for me,” he said in a deposition.

Antognini’s rare position as a doctor vouching for lethal injection has made him a valuable witness in capital cases, including a Missouri case that later reached the Supreme Court. Antognini charges $400 an hour, $2,000 for a deposition, $4,000 per day in court and $2,000 per travel day.

In a deposition in the Missouri case, which involved the same lethal injection drug, Antognini testified that pentobarbital would make the prisoner unconscious within 30 seconds and people can’t suffer while they’re unconscious. “Can you explain to me how you would have suffering in somebody who is unconscious?” Antognini said. “I don’t see how that can happen based on my understanding of how all this works.”

Yet just a few minutes earlier Antognini had acknowledged, “We don’t know how anesthetics work.” Scientists understand how the drugs act in the brain on a cellular level, he explained, but not how they produce unconsciousness.

The Supreme Court accepted Antognini’s pentobarbital testimony. Other courts have been skeptical, ascribing his views “little or no weight.”

Reached by phone, Antognini said he was busy and agreed to talk at a later time. When that time came, Antognini declined to comment. “I wish you all a very merry Christmas,” he said, and hung up.

“Some Objective Factor”

By the summer of 2019, BOP determined that its drug supply was secure and it was ready to schedule executions. The agency gave Barr a list of 14 prisoners, out of about 60 on death row, who had exhausted their appeals. The Justice Department has refused to disclose this list. (Court records include a list from 2017 with 10 names, but they must not overlap entirely because two of the prisoners who Barr chose in 2019 were not on the earlier list.)

Barr decided whom to execute with the help of the then-deputy attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen (set to become the acting attorney general), and aides including Paul Perkins and Timothy Shea (who later became acting U.S. attorney in Washington and now leads the Drug Enforcement Administration). The officials mulled executing all 14 but decided to start with five.

They chose the five, according to Weinsheimer’s deposition, for the same reason that Barr would publicly announce on July 25, 2019: They were “convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly.”

“There was an effort to find some objective factor in looking at the 14,” Weinsheimer said. “This was an aggravating factor that seemed to apply.”

In fact, that wasn’t true. Barr’s summary of the case of Daniel Lee incorrectly said he “murdered a family of three, including an 8-year-old girl.” The undisputed evidence was that Lee refused to kill the girl, so his co-defendant did. The co-defendant was sentenced to life in prison, while Lee was sentenced to death.

Weinsheimer said he didn’t know if there were other death row inmates who murdered children or the elderly. There were, according to a review by ProPublica.

Barr’s announcement also justified the executions on the basis that “we owe it to the victims and their families.” This also was not true in Lee’s case: Family members of Lee’s victims have publicly come out against executing him (as have the prosecutor and judge). The families of the four other prisoners’ victims supported the executions. In any event, the Justice Department didn’t consult victims’ family members when deciding who to kill, Weinsheimer said in his deposition.

The Justice Department also didn’t review the prisoners’ physical or mental health as part of its selection, according to Weinsheimer. One of the five, Alfred Bourgeois, had an IQ between 70 and 75, and his lawyers argued he is intellectually disabled. Another, Wesley Purkey, suffered from schizophrenia, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, which his lawyers said made him unable to understand the reason for his execution.

Weinsheimer said the Justice Department decided to schedule the executions in the order that the prisoners were convicted, with the oldest first. However, they were not the oldest capital convictions, according to ProPublica’s review.

As for the executions’ timing, Barr’s announcement did not explain why, after a 17-year hiatus, the first three executions were scheduled within one week of each other. BOP officials voiced concern that these back-to-back executions would put more stress on their staff, the agency’s lawyer said in a deposition. (After a 2014 lethal injection in Oklahoma went gruesomely awry, the state’s investigation concluded that one contributing factor was having two executions scheduled that day.) Nevertheless, BOP’s lawyer said the agency booked three executions in one week because of “guidance from the attorney general.” Weinsheimer denied that Barr gave a “direction” on how to schedule the executions.

“Moot”

Even prisoners who have exhausted their post-conviction appeals can go back to court to try to stop their execution once a date is set. A federal judge in Washington put the executions on hold in November 2019. The appeals court disagreed in April. Barr swiftly rescheduled the executions for Lee, Purkey and Dustin Honken, in a span of four days in July. In this announcement, Barr cut two from the original five (Bourgeois and Lezmond Mitchell), and added a new prisoner, Keith Nelson. The unifying theme, he said, was “murdering children,” repeating his inaccurate summary of Lee’s crime.

On the day Lee was supposed to be executed, the judge in Washington ordered a new injunction. The appeals court declined to intervene, so the Justice Department went to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been consistently hostile to last-ditch reprieves in capital cases. “Courts should police carefully against attempts to use such challenges as tools to interpose unjustified delay,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a 2019 case (the Missouri execution that featured Antognini’s testimony).

Read More Trump Races to Weaken Environmental and Worker Protections, and Implement Other Last-Minute Policies, Before Jan. 20 The Trump administration is rushing to approve dozens of eleventh-hour policy changes. Among them: The Justice Department is fast-tracking a rule that could reintroduce firing squads and electrocutions to federal executions.

The conservatives have been equally unsympathetic to objections to lethal injection, considering that the court never found a constitutional problem with “traditionally accepted methods” such as hanging, electrocution and firing squad. “The Eighth Amendment does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death,” Gorsuch wrote in the Missouri case, “something that, of course, isn’t guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes.”

Early on July 14, five justices ruled that Lee’s execution could go ahead, saying that he had “not made the showing required to justify last-minute intervention.” Technically, Lee’s death warrant had expired at midnight, but the government issued a new same-day notice and went ahead with the execution around 4 a.m. Lee’s lawyers protested that there was still a separate court order that the Supreme Court hadn’t addressed, so officers left Lee on the gurney while government lawyers worked to wipe out that last obstacle. “That cautious step, taken to ensure undoubted compliance with court orders, is irreconcilable with the suggestion that the department ‘rushed’ the execution or disregarded any law,” Rosen, the deputy attorney general, wrote in a July op-ed. Less than an hour after a federal appeals court granted the government’s request, Lee was dead.

“Today, Lee finally faced the justice he deserved,” Barr said in a statement.

Later that day, at a White House press conference, Trump referred to Lee’s execution as part of his attack on the Democratic Party platform. “Abolish completely the death penalty,” he said. “You know what happened today with regard to the death penalty.”

Trump’s campaign was more explicit in an email blast the next day. “President Trump ensured total justice for the victims of an evil killer,” the campaign told supporters. “With the Trump administration slated to administer total justice to three more child murderers and rapists in the coming weeks, Biden should explain why they should be protected from paying the ultimate price for their evil, horrific crimes.”

That same day, July 15, Purkey was scheduled to die. Again after 2 a.m., a sharply divided Supreme Court lifted the outstanding court orders. Purkey’s lawyers rushed to federal district court for a new emergency stay on the basis that his Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia left Purkey unable to understand his sentence. But the Justice Department made clear that it would not wait to let that petition play out.

In a “courtesy notice” emailed to one of Purkey’s lawyers at 2:03 a.m. on July 16, a senior Justice Department official said the execution would go forward at 4 a.m., despite the new court filing. “Your colleague asked me whether the govt would delay the execution to allow the judge … to consider the stay application,” Hashim Mooppan, counselor to the solicitor general, said in the email. “In light of the Supreme Court’s orders today and on Tuesday morning, the government will not delay the execution further. Absent a court order barring the execution, the govt intends to proceed.”

The judge, in fact, did say the execution should halt while he considered the motion, but he swiftly denied it, and chastised Purkey’s lawyers for “procedural gamesmanship.”

“Despite the risk of irreparable harm to Mr. Purkey, the balance of equities do not weigh in his favor,” wrote the judge, James R. Sweeney II, who was appointed by Trump in 2017. Sweeney’s brief order did not specify what equities he weighed, but the government had argued that Purkey’s sentence had already been upheld multiple times.

As Purkey’s lawyers rushed to appeal, BOP went ahead with placing an IV in Purkey’s arm. He was dead before the appeals court made its ruling. The court later dismissed Purkey’s appeal as “moot” because he was already dead.

Honken died the next day, the third that week.

“A Personal Interest”

As prisoners desperately fought the government’s execution plans in court, they argued that overdosing on pentobarbital would be so excruciating that even death by firing squad would be less painful. Justice Department lawyers chafed at the suggestion. In response, they said firing squads were “more primitive” than lethal injection, and reintroducing them would be a “regressive change.”

Two weeks later, however, the agency took steps to do just that. The Justice Department proposed a regulatory change to authorize execution methods besides lethal injection, including firing squads, which remain legal in three states. “This proposed rule would provide the federal government with greater flexibility to conduct executions in any manner allowed by federal law,” the agency said. “The proposed rule would therefore forestall potential future arguments by prisoners in litigation.”

The proposal made other tweaks to the department’s regulations to address issues raised in litigation — not exactly admitting error, but tacitly acknowledging cracks in the government’s legal foundation.

While the proposal was formally signed by Barr, its point person was Laurence E. Rothenberg, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Policy. Though he is a career employee, Rothenberg’s LinkedIn profile picture shows him standing proudly with Barr, and he has staked out a public position supporting the death penalty.

Laurence Rothenberg was the point person on revising the federal government’s execution regulations. His profile picture on LinkedIn shows him with Barr holding a Justice Department award.

In a 2004 law journal article (also published by the conservative Federalist Society), Rothenberg described the death penalty as “intrinsically just.” He also defended executing juvenile offenders against claims that doing so violates international law.

In another article, from 2006, Rothenberg and a Justice Department colleague attacked common critiques of the death penalty. “The extent of racial disparities in capital cases in the United States has been vastly exaggerated,” they wrote.

Rothenberg has said that his criminal justice views are shaped by a family tragedy. “I also have a personal interest in, and commitment to, this work, as the son of a murder victim,” he said in 2009 congressional testimony about a victims rights law. In 1974, Rothenberg’s parents were shot, his father fatally, on a trip to the Virgin Islands. The shooter was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.

The regulation became final the day after Thanksgiving.

“It Didn’t Go Well”

For the next round of executions, Barr’s announcement simply said that the two prisoners, William LeCroy and Christopher Vialva, were “convicted of murder.” He gave no other reason or explanation for their selection.

Earlier this month, the Justice Department executed Vialva’s co-defendant, Brandon Bernard. Bernard was 18 at the time and did not pull the trigger. The prosecutor and five of the nine all-white jurors who convicted Bernard, who is Black, have since said his life should be spared. The reality star Kim Kardashian tried unsuccessfully to convince Trump to commute his sentence.

At the federal death row facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, the inmates are allowed to leave each other bequests, according to The New York Times. Alfred Bourgeois received his friend Bernard’s wrist watch for the single day before it was his turn to die.

Bourgeois was strapped to a gurney in the middle of a green-tiled room, an IV in his arm. As the pentobarbital flowed, Bourgeois’ stomach heaved and popped, according to George Hale, a public radio reporter who witnessed the execution. The apparent gasping for breath was consistent with how lawyers have described the drowning sensation that the injection could cause.

Spent some time reviewing my notes and @NPR coverage from the five most recent federal executions in Terre Haute, Indiana. The execution of Alfred Bourgeois last Friday stands apart from the others in several important ways. It didn't go well. — George Hale | جورج هيل (@georgehale) December 16, 2020

Bourgeois’ death took 28 minutes, almost twice as long as Bernard’s. Hale said, “If Alfred Bourgeois was suffering that night, he suffered for a long time.”

There are three more federal executions scheduled in January — eight, six and five days before Biden’s inauguration."

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — It seemed like a friendly chat between neighbors. Only after a bomb exploded in downtown Nashville on Christmas morning could Rick Laude grasp the sinister meaning behind his neighbor’s smiling remark that the city and the rest of the world would never forget him.

Laude told The Associated Press on Monday that he was speechless when he learned that authorities identified his 63-year-old neighbor, Anthony Quinn Warner, as the man suspected of detonating a bomb that killed himself , injured three other people and damaged dozens of buildings.

Laude said he saw Warner standing at his mailbox less than a week before Christmas and pulled over in his car to talk. After asking how Warner’s elderly mother was doing, Laude said he casually asked, “Is Santa going to bring you anything good for Christmas?”

Warner smiled and said, “Oh, yeah, Nashville and the world is never going to forget me,” Laude recalled.

Laude said he didn’t think much of the remark and thought Warner only meant that “something good” was going to happen for him financially.

“Nothing about this guy raised any red flags,” Laude said. “He was just quiet.”

Laude said Warner sometimes did not respond when he and other neighbors waved to him, but said he did not take it personally. “I knew that he was just a recluse,” he said.

Warner left behind clues that suggest he planned the bombing and intended to kill himself, but a clear motive remained elusive.

“We hope to get an answer. Sometimes, it’s just not possible,” David Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said Monday in an interview on NBC’s “Today” show. “The best way to find motive is to talk to the individual. We will not be able to do that in this case.”

As investigators continued to search for a motive, body camera video released late Monday by Nashville police offered more insight to the moments leading up to the explosion and its aftermath.

The recording from Officer Michael Sipos’ camera captures officers walking past the RV parked across the street as the recorded warning blares and then helping people evacuate after the thunderous blast off camera. Car alarms and sirens wailed as a voice on the dispatcher calls for all available personnel and a roll call and people stumble through the downtown area littered with glass.

Investigators are analyzing Warner’s belongings collected during the investigation, including a computer and a portable storage drive, and continue to interview witnesses as they try to identify a motive for the explosion, a law enforcement official said. A review of his financial transactions also uncovered purchases of potential bomb-making components, the official said.

Warner had recently given away a vehicle and told the person he gave it to that he had been diagnosed with cancer, though it is unclear whether he indeed had cancer, the official said. Investigators used some items collected from the vehicle, including a hat and gloves, to match Warner’s DNA and DNA was taken from one of his family members, the official said.

The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Warner also apparently gave away his home in Antioch , a Nashville suburb, to a Los Angeles woman a month before the bombing. A property record dated Nov. 25 indicates Warner transferred the home to the woman in exchange for no money after living there for decades. The woman’s signature is not on that document.

Warner had worked as a computer consultant for Nashville real estate agent Steve Fridrich, who told the AP in a text message that Warner had said he was retiring earlier this month.

Officials said Warner had not been on their radar before Christmas. A law enforcement report released Monday showed that Warner’s only arrest was for a 1978 marijuana-related charge.

“It does appear that the intent was more destruction than death, but again that’s all still speculation at this point as we continue in our investigation with all our partners,” Rausch added.

Furthermore, officials have not provided insight into why Warner selected the particular location for the bombing, which damaged an AT&T building and wreaked havoc on cellphone service and police and hospital communications in several Southern states. By Monday, the company said the majority of services had been restored for residents and businesses.

Forensic analysts were reviewing evidence from the blast site to try to identify the components of the explosives as well as information from the U.S. Bomb Data Center for intelligence and investigative leads, according to a law enforcement official who said investigators were examining Warner’s digital footprint and financial history.

The official, who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, said federal agents were examining a number of potential leads and pursuing several theories, including the possibility that the AT&T building was targeted.

Doug Korneski, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Memphis field office, said Sunday that officials were looking at any and all motives and were interviewing acquaintances of Warner’s to try to determine what may have motivated him.

The bombing took place early on a holiday morning well before downtown streets were bustling with activity. Police were responding to a report of shots fired when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Then, for reasons that may never be known, the audio switched to a recording of Petula Clark’s 1964 hit “Downtown” shortly before the blast.

In addition to the DNA found at the blast site, investigators from the Tennessee Highway Patrol were able to link the vehicle identification number recovered from the wreckage to an RV registered to Warner, officials said.

“We’re still following leads, but right now there is no indication that any other persons were involved,” Korneski said. “We’ve reviewed hours of security video surrounding the recreation vehicle. We saw no other people involved.”

President-elect Joe Biden on Monday called the bombing “a reminder of the destructive power an individual or a small group can muster and the need for continued vigilance across the board.”

President Donald Trump hasn’t publicly commented on the explosion but has spoken to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and offered resources and support, according to the governor’s office.

The electric-car maker will start with sales and then might look at assembly and manufacturing based on the response, the minister told here the newspaper.

Tesla and the minister’s office could not be reached by Reuters for comment.

India has been keen to reduce its oil dependence and cut down on pollution, but its efforts to promote electric vehicles have been stymied by a lack of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure such as charging stations.

The first model to be launched will be Model 3, the cheapest among Tesla vehicles, with prices starting at over $74,739 (5.5 million Indian rupees), according to a report in the Economic Times on Saturday. (bit.ly/355Y4i3)

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Sunday confirmed India foray in 2021 in a reply on Twitter bit.ly/3hnpwMY, but said it would not happen in January.

In October, the government of Maharashtra had invited Tesla to the state, weeks after Musk suggested entering the country next year.

Details: While Trump signed the current bill providing $600 checks for most Americans hours before a midnight government shutdown deadline, he is continuing his push to bring that amount to $2,000, as Axios reported earlier.

Trump said in a statement the House would on Monday ""vote to increase payments to individuals from $600 to $2,000"" and both the House and Senate ""have agreed to focus strongly"" on his baseless electoral fraud allegations.

The Senate has also promised that the tech industry's prized liability shield, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, ""will be reviewed and either be terminated or substantially reformed,"" he said.

"" The Senate will start the process for a vote that increases checks to $2,000, repeals Section 230, and starts an investigation into voter fraud.""

— Excerpt from Trump's statement

Between the lines: Those provisions were sweeteners to get Trump to agree to sign the legislation — a way of assuring him that his key demands would get a hearing, Republican officials said.

Why it matters: Trump's delay in signing the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill and $1.4 trillion government funding measure caused unemployment benefits for millions of Americans to lapse overnight.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers, angered over the delay, urged Trump earlier on Sunday to sign the measure, saying ""too many people"" depended on it.

What they're saying: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) issued a statement saying, ""The compromise bill is not perfect, but it will do an enormous amount of good for struggling Kentuckians and Americans across the country who need help now.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Trump's signing of the bill was ""welcome news for the fourteen million Americans who just lost the lifeline of unemployment benefits on Christmas Weekend, and for the millions more struggling to stay afloat during this historic pandemic and economic crisis.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) tweeted, ""The House will pass a bill to give Americans $2,000 checks. Then I will move to pass it in the Senate. No Democrats will object. Will Senate Republicans?""

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump signed a $900 billion pandemic relief package Sunday, ending days of drama over his refusal to accept the bipartisan deal that will deliver long-sought cash to businesses and individuals and avert a federal government shutdown.

The massive bill includes $1.4 trillion to fund government agencies through September and contains other end-of-session priorities such as an increase in food stamp benefits.

The signing, at his private club in Florida, came amid escalating criticism over his eleventh-hour demands for larger, $2,000 relief checks and scaled-back spending even though the bill had already passed the House and Senate by wide margins. The bill was passed with what lawmakers had thought was Trump’s blessing, and after months of negotiations with his administration.

His foot-dragging resulted in a lapse in unemployment benefits for millions struggling to make ends meet and threatened a government shutdown in the midst of a pandemic.. But signing the bill into law prevents another crisis of Trump’s own creation and ends a standoff with his own party during the final days of his administration.

It was unclear what, if anything, Trump accomplished with his delay, beyond angering all sides and empowering Democrats to continue their push for higher relief checks, which his own party opposes.

In his statement, Trump repeated his frustrations with the COVID-19 relief bill for providing only $600 checks to most Americans instead of the $2,000 that his fellow Republicans already rejected. He also complained about what he considered unnecessary spending by the government at large.

“I will sign the Omnibus and Covid package with a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed,” Trump said in the statement.

While the president insisted he would send Congress “a redlined version” with items to be removed under the rescission process, those are merely suggestions to Congress. The bill, as signed, would not necessarily be changed.

Democrats, who have the majority in the House, immediately vowed to prevent any cuts. Democrats “will reject any rescissions” submitted by the president, said Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. , in a statement.

Lawmakers now have breathing room to continue debating whether the relief checks should be as large as the president has demanded. The Democratic-led House supports the larger checks and is set to vote on the issue Monday, but it’s expected to be ignored by the Republican-held Senate where spending faces opposition. For now, the administration can only begin work sending out the $600 payments.

Republicans and Democrats swiftly welcomed Trump’s decision to sign the bill into law.

“The compromise bill is not perfect, but it will do an enormous amount of good for struggling Kentuckians and Americans across the country who need help now,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “I thank the President for signing this relief into law.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the signing “welcome news for the fourteen million Americans who just lost the lifeline of unemployment benefits on Christmas weekend, and for the millions more struggling to stay afloat during this historic pandemic and economic crisis.”

But others slammed Trump’s delay in turning the bill into law. In a tweet, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., accused Trump of having “played Russian roulette with American lives. A familiar and comfortable place for him.”

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he would offer Trump’s proposal for $2,000 checks for a vote in Senate — putting Republicans on the spot.

“The House will pass a bill to give Americans $2,000 checks. Then I will move to pass it in the Senate,” Schumer tweeted. “No Democrats will object. Will Senate Republicans?”

Democrats are promising more aid to come once President-elect Joe Biden takes office, but Republicans are signaling a wait-and-see approach.

Congress will push ahead Monday, with the House expected to vote to override Trump’s veto of an annual must-pass Defense bill, confronting the president on another big issue in the final days of the session. The Senate is expected to follow on Tuesday.

In the face of growing economic hardship, spreading disease and a looming shutdown, lawmakers spent Sunday urging Trump to sign the legislation immediately, then have Congress follow up with additional aid. Aside from unemployment benefits and relief payments to families, money for vaccine distribution, businesses and more was on the line. Protections against evictions also hung in the balance.

“What the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “So many people are hurting. ... It is really insane and this president has got to finally ... do the right thing for the American people and stop worrying about his ego.”

Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said he understood that Trump “wants to be remembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he’ll be remembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this to expire.”

Toomey added: “So I think the best thing to do, as I said, sign this and then make the case for subsequent legislation.”

The same point was echoed by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who’s criticized Trump’s pandemic response and his efforts to undo the election results. “I just gave up guessing what he might do next,” he said.

Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said too much is at stake for Trump to “play this old switcheroo game.”

“I don’t get the point,” he said. “I don’t understand what’s being done, why, unless it’s just to create chaos and show power and be upset because you lost the election.”

Washington had been reeling since Trump turned on the deal. Fingers pointed at administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as lawmakers tried to understand whether they were misled about Trump’s position.

“Now to be put in a lurch, after the president’s own person negotiated something that the president doesn’t want, it’s just — it’s surprising,” Kinzinger said.

Kinzinger spoke on CNN’s “State of the Union,” and Hogan and Sanders on ABC’s “This Week.”

Protests keep up against Israeli PM as new election looms,178,kkr4a0,https://apnews.com/article/israel-national-elections-elections-benjamin-netanyahu-coronavirus-pandemic-ada2fd494d3296a225aad0477dbc8e14,3,1609049612.0,,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Hundreds of Israelis protested against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday, calling on the long-serving leader to resign just days after the country was plunged into a new national election.

The protesters have been gathering outside Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence for months, slamming him for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and saying he cannot lead the country while under indictment for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate corruption cases. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing.

Protesters held signs urging Netanyahu to “Go,” and declaring “We won’t stop protesting until you get out of our lives.”

While turnout was lower than previous demonstrations amid colder weather, the protesters have a new impetus because Israel appears headed toward its fourth election in two years in March, in which Netanyahu faces new challenges from defectors from his conservative Likud Party.

The election will likely be another referendum on Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader and also one of its most polarizing. It will come just after Netanyahu’s trial enters its evidentiary stage, which will likely lodge the corruption charges against him firmly in the public discourse during what is expected to be a bitter, divisive campaign.

Saturday’s protest came a day before Israel heads into its third national coronavirus lockdown, with much of the economy again shutting down amid surging infection numbers. Critics say Netanyahu and his so-called “emergency” government — set up in the spring specifically to deal with the virus — bungled their response, bringing the country to another costly lockdown.

Netanyahu points to the country’s current vaccination campaign, which has among the world’s highest per capita inoculation numbers, as the country’s way out of the worldwide health crisis."

ATLANTA (AP) — Changes to the way millions of Americans voted this year contributed to record turnout, but that’s no guarantee the measures making it easier to cast ballots will stick around for future elections.

Republicans in key states that voted for President-elect Joe Biden already are pushing for new restrictions, especially to absentee voting. It’s an option many states expanded amid the coronavirus outbreak that proved hugely popular and helped ensure one of the smoothest election days in recent years.

President Donald Trump has been unrelenting in his attacks on mail voting as he continues to challenge the legitimacy of an election he lost. Despite a lack of evidence and dozens of losses in the courts, his claims of widespread voter fraud have gained traction with some Republican elected officials.

They are vowing to crack down on mail ballots and threatening to roll back other steps that have made it easier for people to vote.

“This myth could not justify throwing out the results of the election, nor can it justify imposing additional burdens on voters that will disenfranchise many Americans,” said Wendy Weiser, head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.

An estimated 108 million people voted before Election Day, either through early in-person voting or by mailing or dropping off absentee ballots. That represented nearly 70% of all votes cast, after states took steps to make it easier to avoid crowded polling places during the pandemic.

A few states sent ballots to every registered voter while others dropped requirements that voters needed a specific excuse to cast an absentee ballot. Many states added drop boxes and expanded early voting options.

The changes were popular with voters and did not lead to widespread fraud. A group of election officials including representatives of the federal cybersecurity agency called the 2020 presidential election the “most secure” election in U.S. history, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press there had been no evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of the election.

Nevertheless, Republicans in Georgia have proposed adding a photo ID requirement when voting absentee, a ban on drop boxes and possibly a return to requiring an excuse for mail voting, such as illness or traveling for work on Election Day.

Early supporters of the ID requirement include Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Republicans who were criticized relentlessly by Trump for failing to back his fraud claims after losing in Georgia. A top deputy for Raffensperger has said the ID requirement would boost public confidence and refute any future claims of fraud.

The state’s two U.S. Senate runoffs next month will take place under current law, which requires local election officials to verify signatures on absentee ballots.

In Pennsylvania, Republican lawmakers have been writing legislation to address what they claim are problems with the 2020 election and mail voting in particular, even though courts and elections officials have found no evidence of widespread problems.

“We’d like to tighten it up as soon as we can,” said Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward.

Republicans hold majorities in both legislative chambers, and their support was instrumental in a year-old state law that expanded mail voting to all registered voters. One bill being discussed would go so far as to repeal that law and force voters to state an excuse to receive a ballot in the mail.

Previous elections have shown that voters appreciate mail voting, no matter their party affiliation. Republican candidates down the ballot did very well this year, even as a record 81.2 million voters cast their ballot for the Democrat in the presidential race.

In Michigan, Republicans held every congressional seat and kept control of the legislature despite Trump losing the state. Yet Republicans still held a legislative hearing in which Trump’s lawyers argued there were widespread irregularities without explaining how these somehow affected only the presidential race but not other contests.

“Just like we have seen a lot of legislators making ill-advised decisions to hold hearings that ended up being more political theater than policy debates, we can similarly expect legislators to further this hyper-partisan agenda to restrict the vote,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat.

Benson said lawmakers should instead look to the high turnout for the presidential election as a guide to improving what worked and then make changes sought by elections officials, such as providing more time for clerks to process mail ballots. Michigan does not allow that work to begin until the day before Election Day.

Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said her organization also would like to see lawmakers focus on reducing the strain facing local election officials.

“The more time that we spend in debating other issues, the less time that we have to do something good with changes to the election code,” Schaefer said.

Democrats and voting rights groups have already begun pushing back, saying Republicans should be focused on protecting voter access to the polls and not feeding into conspiracy theories launched by Trump and his allies to undermine the Nov. 3 election.

They say ID requirements accomplish little, but have a high cost.

“It’s a solution in search of a problem,” said California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat who was recently tapped to fill the U.S. Senate seat of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. “It will undoubtedly have the net effect of disenfranchising a lot of people without necessarily improving election security.”

Padilla supports sending registered voters a ballot in the mail.

Voter fraud does happen, but studies have shown it’s exceedingly rare. Numerous safeguards are built into voting systems to ensure that only eligible voters cast a ballot. Election officials say when fraud does happen, people are caught and prosecuted.

Not all Republicans are seeking to add restrictions.

In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose said his legislative priorities are to expand early voting locations, increase oversight of election vendors, add an online option for requesting absentee ballots and address confusion over drop boxes.

“Ohio’s got a good thing going, but we don’t want to rest on our laurels,” said LaRose, who wants his priorities approved by the Republican-dominated legislature.

Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams said the pandemic forced the state to implement early voting, which proved popular among voters of both major parties. The Republican said he thinks it’s likely state lawmakers will create an early voting policy for subsequent elections and has heard of no opposition to that in the GOP-controlled legislature.

“It just makes voting easier,” he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Famed former British spy and Soviet Union double agent George Blake died on Saturday at the age of 98, the RIA news agency reported, citing Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence agency.

"Vehicle explodes in downtown Nashville, police call it an 'intentional act'",322,kk183n,https://www.reuters.com/article/BigStory12/idUSKBN28Z0SB,56,1608940879.0,,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (Reuters) -A motor home parked on a street exploded in downtown Nashville at dawn on Friday, moments after a recorded message emanating from the vehicle warned of a bomb, in what police called an “intentional act” in the heart of America’s country music capital.

Three people were injured in the Christmas morning blast, though none critically. Authorities said it was uncertain whether anyone was inside the recreational vehicle when it exploded, but police reported hours later that investigators had found possible human remains nearby.

Nashville Mayor John Cooper ordered a curfew imposed around the blast site through the holiday weekend as FBI investigators comb the scene, though police said they were aware of no further threats to Tennessee’s most populous city.

Authorities offered no explanation as to a possible motive, and there was no claim of responsibility.

The blast came just moments after officers responded to reports of gunfire in the area and discovered the recreational vehicle parked outside an AT&T building in downtown Nashville at about 6 a.m. CST (1200 GMT).

Police heard a recorded voice warning that a “bomb would detonate in 15 minutes,” Nashville Police Chief John Drake told reporters.

The message, as captured in a recording broadcast later by local television news stations, said: “This area must be evacuated now. This area must be evacuated now. If you can hear this message, evacuate now. If you can hear this message, evacuate now.”

Officers quickly went door-to-door in nearby buildings to hustle people to safety, and called for dispatch of the police bomb squad, which was on its way to the scene when the vehicle blew up, police spokesman Don Aaron said.

The Metro Nashville Police Department posted a photo of the recreational vehicle on its Twitter feed and said that the vehicle had arrived in the area at 1:22 a.m.

COMPUTERIZED-GENERATED VOICE

An area resident, Betsy Williams, told CNN that she was awakened by the sound of gunfire and looked out her window to see an RV parked across the street as it began playing a message delivered by a “computerized” female voice. She said the voice warned the vehicle contained a bomb and started a minute-by-minute countdown to the actual explosion.

“Everything shook, it was quite a blast,” she told CNN.

The fiery blast destroyed a number of other vehicles parked nearby, shattered windows and heavily damaged several adjacent buildings, sending a pall of black smoke into the sky that could be seen for miles. The mayor said a total of 41 businesses were damaged.

Fire officials said three people were taken to local hospitals with relatively minor injuries, and they were listed in stable condition. Authorities said quick action by police to begin evacuating the area before the blast likely prevented more casualties.

“Obviously, they heard the announcements coming from this vehicle,” Aaron told reporters. “They took them seriously. And worked to seal the streets to protect folks and we think it worked.” He called the blast “an intentional act.”

Shops and other buildings were closed given the early hour of the day, the Christmas holiday and prevailing COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings, also helping to keep injuries to a minimum.

At an early evening briefing, Drake, the police chief, told reporters there were “no fatalities we know of,” but said investigators were examining “tissue that we believe could be human remains” found in the vicinity of the blast.

Police said they had not ascertained whether anyone was in the motor home when it exploded.

MOTIVE UNCLEAR

Damage to AT&T facilities from the explosion caused widespread disruptions of telephone, internet and fiber optic TV service in central Tennessee and parts of several neighboring states, including Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama and Georgia, the company said.

Drake said authorities had received no threats of an attack prior to the reports of gunfire at the outset of the incident, describing the blast as a “total surprise.”

“We had no pre-warnings at all,” he said.

The explosion occurred about two blocks from Lower Broadway, where some of Nashville’s famous live music venues are located. The Ryman Auditorium, former home of the Grand Ole Opry and just three blocks from the blast scene, was undamaged. The Gaylord Opryland and current Grand Ole Opry complexes, which sit outside the downtown area, were not impacted.

“It’s a startling thing to have it happen in Nashville so close, and on Christmas, but we understand that America is in very tumultuous times right now,” country singer John Rich, who owns a honky-tonk club a block from the explosion, told Reuters.

The blast could be heard for miles and was felt at least nine blocks away, knocking one officer off his feet, Aaron said.

Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were assisting in the probe, agency officials said.

Nashville’s vice mayor, Jim Shulman, told CNN the incident appeared to have been a solitary act, though bomb-sniffing dogs were being led through the downtown area as a precaution."
An Oscar Winner Made a Khashoggi Documentary. Streaming Services Didn’t Want It.,281,kjunas,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/business/media/dissident-jamal-khashoggi-netflix-amazon.html,11,1608907219.0,,"Bryan Fogel’s first documentary, “Icarus,” helped uncover the Russian doping scandal that led to the country’s expulsion from the 2018 Winter Olympics. It also won an Oscar for him and for Netflix, which released the film.

For his second project, he chose another subject with global interest: the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi Arabian dissident and Washington Post columnist, and the role that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, played in it.

A film by an Oscar-winning filmmaker would normally garner plenty of attention from streaming services, which have used documentaries and niche movies to attract subscribers and earn awards. Instead, when Mr. Fogel’s film, “The Dissident,” was finally able to find a distributor after eight months, it was with an independent company that had no streaming platform and a much narrower reach.

“These global media companies are no longer just thinking, ‘How is this going to play for U.S. audiences?’” Mr. Fogel said. “They are asking: ‘What if I put this film out in Egypt? What happens if I release it in China, Russia, Pakistan, India?’ All these factors are coming into play, and it’s getting in the way of stories like this.”"

DOVER, England (AP) — Truckers and travelers stuck in a days-long gridlock at the English port of Dover started heading to France on Thursday after the country partially reopened its borders with Britain following international concern over a rapidly spreading new coronavirus variant.

However, thousands of stranded truck drivers still awaited their turns to cross the English Channel, held up by the slow delivery of coronavirus tests. Trucks inched slowly forward to the ferries and trains that link Britain with France, as authorities checked that drivers could show the negative virus tests now required to cross.

Officials warned the backlog could take days to clear, and many truckers will likely spend Christmas waiting in their cabs.

Dozens of countries swiftly halted travel from the U.K. last weekend after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said London and other areas of southern England had to close all non-essential stores and call off holiday plans to curb a new, much more contagious version of the virus.

China on Thursday became the latest nation to suspend flights to and from the U.K., further isolating the country.

But infection rates continue to soar, particularly in London and surrounding areas. The capital now has the highest rate of people testing positive in the country, according to the latest figures. The Office for National Statistics estimated that 2.1% of the people in London had COVID-19 in mid-December, compared to around 1.18%, or one in 85 people, for the wider population in England. The figures do not include people in hospitals or care homes.

The majority of new positive cases confirmed in London were believed to be the coronavirus variant, the statistics office said. For England as a whole, it estimated that about half of all new cases could be the new variant.

Officials say the new variant is dangerous because it is more transmissible, though they stress there is no evidence it makes people more ill. Christmas gatherings and festive shopping were cancelled for millions at the last minute in a bid to control the spread of the virus and ensure hospitals, many of which are nearing capacity, are not overwhelmed.

In Dover, two dozen French firefighters and British military were working with health officials to test thousands of truckers, who must return a negative COVID-19 test to make the crossing.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Twitter that of the 2,367 virus tests administered at the port as of Thursday afternoon, just three turned out positive.

The operators of the Channel Tunnel, also known as the Eurotunnel or “Chunnel,” told The Associated Press that the backlog is slowly clearing and around 1,200 trucks so far passed Thursday through the underwater railway passage that runs from England to France.

But some 5,000 drivers remained stranded at the Dover ferry crossing, and a Dover port spokeswoman said just about 700 trucks have departed.

British and French authorities have agreed to keep the border between the countries open throughout Christmas to help truck drivers and travelers get home.

“Normally, we close on the 25th, but now, given the situation, the port will remain open,” said Jean-Marc Puissesseau, president of the French ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer. Extra staff members agreed to work the holiday,

France’s temporary shutdown of the border raised the most concerns because France is a major conduit for trade and travel between Britain and the continent. The U.K. relies heavily on cross-Channel commercial links to the continent for food at this time of year, especially fresh fruit and vegetables.

The announcement of the coronavirus variant came as Europe has been walloped by soaring new virus infections and deaths. Europe as a whole has recorded over 500,000 virus-related deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts agree is probably an undercount due to missed cases and other factors.

In France, officials defended the country’s handling of the border after the EU’s transport commissioner issued unusually strong criticism.

Commissioner Adina Valean, of Romania, tweeted: “I deplore that France went against our recommendations and brought us back to the situation we were in in March when the supply chains were interrupted.”

France’s European affairs minister, Clement Beaune, tweeted back that France had “exactly followed the EU recommendation” and is now “more open than other European countries” to arrivals from Britain.

The Toll Of Conspiracy Theories: A Voting Security Expert Lives In Hiding,27,kj2tzn,https://www.npr.org/2020/12/23/948828692/the-toll-of-conspiracy-theories-a-voting-security-expert-lives-in-hiding,4,1608791364.0,,"The Toll Of Conspiracy Theories: A Voting Security Expert Lives In Hiding

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Bazemore/AP John Bazemore/AP

More than a month ago, Eric Coomer went into hiding.

The voting conspiracy theories that have led millions of Republicans to feel as though the election was stolen from them, which are still spreading, have also led to calls for Coomer's head.

Coomer oversees product strategy and security for Dominion Voting Systems, the Denver-based company that has suddenly found itself at the center of many of President Trump's false claims about November's election, spread by allies and pro-Trump media.

Some of Trump's supporters have focused on Coomer as the supposed evil mastermind.

""I actually am in fear for my safety,"" Coomer said recently, speaking by video call from an undisclosed location to Colorado Public Radio. ""I'm in fear for my family's safety. These are real, tangible things coming out of these baseless accusations.""

On Tuesday, Coomer sued the Trump campaign and a number of allies, alleging defamation.

It's just the latest example of how people's lives are being upended and potentially ruined by the unprecedented flurry of disinformation this year.

The problem grows

As people experience their own individual Internet bubbles, it can be hard to recognize just how much misinformation exists and how the current information ecosystem compares with previous years.

But companies that specialize in the subject said it is getting exponentially worse.

NewsGuard, which vets news sources based on transparency and reliability standards, found recently that among the top 100 sources of news in the U.S., sources it deemed unreliable had four times as many interactions this year compared with 2019.

The media intelligence platform Zignal Labs, in an analysis performed at NPR's request, found that misinformation narratives related to vote-by-mail systems alone were mentioned across the media spectrum more than 40 million times since Election Day.

That flood reached Dominion the week after the election, according to Zignal, and misinformation related to the company's machines has been mentioned more than 10 million times since then.

Coomer said in addition to his own information, the personal addresses of everyone from his parents and siblings to his ex-girlfriends have been posted online. Some have also received threatening letters.

""I've been threatened more times than I could even count. Whether it's the standard online trolls, voicemails that are left almost on a daily basis, being called a traitor to this country, I can't even begin to describe what effect this has had on my life,"" he said.

Dominion provides election equipment and software to 28 states, including many of the swing states on which Trump has focused his post-election ire.

In preparing for this November's election, the company gamed out all sorts of worst-case scenarios, but it wasn't on anyone's radar that Dominion and its employees could become the targets of threats.

Coomer said the first barb aimed at him came five days after the election.

The accusation started with a conservative activist in Colorado, Joe Oltmann. He claimed on his podcast that he'd infiltrated a call with Denver-area antifa members that included a man identified as ""Eric from Dominion.""

Oltmann claimed that Coomer said with a laugh on the call that he would make sure Trump didn't win the election.

Immediately, Coomer knew things would blow up.

""The minute I saw it, it left a big pit in my stomach,"" he said.

After that podcast went out, the threats quickly arrived. An online search turns up segments on the pro-Trump outlets Newsmax and One America News Network discussing the allegations as well as people accusing Coomer of treason and calling for him to be publicly executed. Those networks are among the defendants Coomer is suing.

""God is at the wheel, but we are the warriors that must do the work of men to repel evil,"" said one of numerous posts on the conservative social media site Parler.

A Dominion spokeswoman said other company employees have also gone to more secure locations, been threatened and been digitally stalked.

On Nov. 21, a group protested in front of Dominion's Denver headquarters, waving American flags and signs saying ""fraud equals arrests."" Social media posts from the event tagged the far-right group the Proud Boys. No one is currently working out of the building.

Pushing back

Recently, however, there are signs that elections companies, like some election officials, are pushing back against the false accusations.

In addition to Coomer's lawsuit, Dominion is threatening legal action against Sidney Powell, who has been among the loudest voices pushing conspiracy theories on behalf of the Trump campaign. Powell is named in Coomer's suit, along with the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

Smartmatic, a competitor of Dominion's that has also been the subject of wild rumors, has demanded that numerous news networks take back their allegations against it. This weekend, both Fox Business Network and Newsmax appeared to answer those demands with segments debunking some claims.

But election integrity advocates worry the disinformation won't truly begin to recede until political leaders such as Trump stop questioning the election's legitimacy.

Even in an election where almost all the voting was recorded on paper ballots and rigorous audits were done more than ever before, none of that helps if millions of people are working with an alternative set of facts, said Joe Kiniry, chief scientist of the open-source election technology company Free & Fair.

Even if an election is run perfectly, it doesn't matter to a sizable portion of the public who believes it was unfair. No amount of transparency at the county and state level can really combat the sort of megaphone that Trump wields, Kiniry says.

""When we're in the realm of coupling disinformation from both foreign and domestic sources, and government and nongovernment sources, and none of it is really grounded in reality ... evidence doesn't help much,"" he said.

For Coomer, that means his life may be forever changed.

His top goal right now is pretty simple — hoping one day it'll be safe to return home. But he has no idea if that will ever be possible.

""Some of the threats that I've gotten have made very clear that these actors are in it for the long haul. The wishes are that I forever have to look over my shoulder,"" Coomer said. ""And I probably will."""

But much of the spending made through American Made Media Consultants remains a mystery, according to Trump advisors and an Insider analysis of Federal Election Commission records.

The Trump campaign may have violated federal election laws with the arrangement. A trio of Democratic lawmakers have asked the FEC and the Justice Department to investigate, and a campaign watchdog filed a civil complaint with the FEC.

to investigate, and a campaign watchdog filed a civil complaint with the FEC. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The Trump campaign shell company that helped hide $617 million in 2020 presidential-campaign spending was almost exclusively a Trump family production, run in part by a top deputy to Eric Trump, Insider has learned.

That Eric Trump deputy, the attorney Alex Cannon, worked closely to run American Made Media Consultants with President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, daughter-in-law Lara Trump, and former campaign manager Brad Parscale. Together, they built a campaign shell company so powerful and opaque that key Trump campaign aides feared what they might uncover if they learned too much about its operations, according to interviews with more than a dozen Trump advisors and Republicans close to the campaign.

Vast swaths of AMMC's spending still remain a mystery to the public and Trump's own campaign team, though Insider was able to uncover some of American Made Media Consultants' expenditures from interviews and public documents filed with the Federal Election Commission.

The power and secrecy of the shell company has spurred calls for federal investigations, including requests filed by three Democratic lawmakers after Insider broke the news last week of Kushner and Lara Trump's involvement.

The AMMC shell company was originally created by the Trump children and Parscale as a means to protect Trump from exorbitant consultant fees and accusations of grifting, many of which had been levied at Parscale for his dual role running the campaign and approving payments to himself, the Trump advisors told Insider.

But as the campaign evolved during 2019 and into the 2020 sprint, AMMC was also used to make secret payments to Lara Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., who doubled as the Trump campaign's national finance director.

It also facilitated large payments — not disclosed publicly — to top campaign strategist Jason Miller, through an arrangement with the campaign firm he worked for before joining the Trump campaign.

Now with Trump's loss clear to almost everyone except Trump, the campaign shell company has become a focal point for advisors lamenting what went wrong. Behind the scenes, competing factions in Trumpworld have been accusing each other of stealing from the president's campaign coffer via the shell company.

Insider broke the news Friday that Kushner helped create AMMC and picked Lara Trump and Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence to serve on its board — facts unknown even to core Trump campaign operatives. Lara Trump is married to Eric Trump.

""The obfuscation raises so many questions,"" one Trump advisor said.

Whether Trump officials broke the law or will face any consequences remains to be seen. Any criminal charges would have to be decided on by prosecutors reporting to President-elect Joe Biden's Justice Department. Biden's transition team did not respond to requests for comment.

Shortly after Insider published its first exposé on American Made Media Consultants, Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu of California and Kathleen Rice of New York requested the FBI and Federal Election Commission investigate the Trump campaign and shell company for what they considered possible violations of civil and criminal campaign laws. They specifically cited laws barring the spending of campaign cash for personal use and requiring public disclosure of payees.

The shell company could incur upward of $1 billion in fines because it was acting as a campaign committee without filing required disclosures, Rep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, wrote Wednesday in a letter to the Justice Department and FEC seeking an investigation of AMMC. But such a fine would be unprecedented.

At a basic level, the Trump campaign's use of AMMC means the public — including Americans who together made millions of small-dollar contributions to Trump's reelection effort — has no clear idea on how the Trump campaign and a sister committee spent about half of the $1.26 billion it raised since Trump began running for reelection on the day of his 2017 inauguration.

""I don't think people stole money with it, but I do think it was used to conceal payments to people who didn't want to show up on reports,"" a second Trump advisor said of AMMC. ""It was nothing illegal. But unseemly? Yes.""

But other Republicans close to the Trump campaign said the shell company and the hiding of payments felt like Trump family members may have crossed a line.

""With Trump, it's all about him and money, and everyone around him took it to the nth degree,"" another Republican close to the Trump campaign said. ""It's truly a criminal enterprise.""

A family enterprise

When Kushner and Parscale created AMMC in April 2018, they picked Lara Trump and John Pence for the board. Both were gone by late 2019.

John Pence's removal came at a time during the presidential campaign when Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, had soured on the vice president's nephew.

Parscale, Kushner, and their allies were also freezing out the vice president's closest aides in summer and fall 2019. Trump advisors saw that move as removing a Pence loyalist and family member from some of the campaign's most sensitive operations.

But when Lara Trump quit the board, Trump advisors familiar with AMMC said they did not assume her power had waned. Rather, they saw the appointment of Alex Cannon to fill Lara Trump's position on the board as proof that Eric and Lara Trump were exercising more control over the operation.

Months earlier, Eric Trump had dispatched Cannon, one of his deputies at the Trump Organization and an understudy of the longtime Trump company lawyer Alan Garten, to his father's reelection campaign, Trump advisors told Insider.

With Cannon on the AMMC board, those same advisors saw an Eric and Lara Trump loyalist enjoying a place of significant power within the president's political machine.

Cannon declined comment when Insider reached him on Tuesday. A Trump campaign spokesman said Eric Trump had nothing to do with AMMC.

""Eric Trump had no involvement in the creation or operation of AMMC. No member of the Trump family was compensated by AMMC. The campaign reports all of its expenditures to the FEC as required by federal law,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said in a statement to Insider.

A web of vendors and subvendors

The federal government could force the Trump campaign — and all political committees — to publicly reveal more about the true recipients of their spending than they do now.

But as is often the case with Congress and the FEC, change happens slowly, if at all.

Current federal law governing political spending disclosure is ""broad enough to enable the FEC to enact regulations that would require the disclosure of vendors and subvendors, and ultimate payees,"" said former FEC Chair Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served on the commission from 2013 to 2017.

One way or another, disclosure of political subvendors and beyond should be compulsory to both guard against domestic shenanigans and disable a ""mechanism to launder foreign contributions and expenditures,"" Ravel said.

Bradley Smith, a former Republican FEC chair who served from 2000 to 2005, concurs — to a point. While the FEC itself could more clearly define spending-disclosure requirements without Congress changing the law, it probably couldn't do so in a ""shotgun approach.""

""If the campaign hires a vendor to produce ads, and that vendor pays various subcontractors — writers, cameramen, etc. — I'm not sure you can or would want that reporting,"" Smith said. ""The big problem is practical — how do you define all the expenditures and purposes?""

While the FEC may be able to require some enhanced spending disclosure, ""statues carry more weight,"" said Mike Sullivan, a campaign-finance expert who served five terms as the director of the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance.

Without more legal clarity, ""the worst-case scenario is a kickback to someone in a campaign without the public knowing about it,"" Sullivan, who urged Congress to address the issue in 2021, said.

Judith Ingram, an FEC spokesperson, said her agency couldn't ""comment on pending or potential enforcement matters,"" and a Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

In a related matter, Congress' veto-proof National Defense Authorization Act that Trump has yet to sign would require anonymous shell companies — including limited liability companies such as American Made Media Consultants — to disclose their real owners to the US Treasury Department.

On the afternoon of January 20, the Treasury Department will fall under Biden's control.

Where did all the money go?

""So who spent the other $1 billion? It wasn't me,"" Parscale tweeted on Monday, pasting a photo of a spreadsheet of his budget for the Trump campaign.

Parscale's reemergence in public over the past month, after a dramatic fall from grace in October, has tipped off a war behind the scenes to assign blame for Trump's loss. But the answer to the larger question Parscale posed is still something of a mystery.

In some ways, AMMC was a positively normal campaign operation for a major presidential reelection effort. It spent large amounts of money on advertising and seemed to pay below-market rates for some commissions to GOP ad firms.

The Trump campaign, along with its joint political venture with the Republican National Committee, publicly reported payments to AMMC using the broadest of descriptions.

The largest class of payments to AMMC went toward ""placed media,"" which in political parlance typically means television advertising. The total tab was $250 million, an Insider analysis of FEC spending data indicated.

Next came ""online advertising"" and related services at nearly $237 million, followed by SMS advertising — text messages and such — at about $72.6 million. That includes about $2.2 million earmarked for recount-related messaging, according to FEC records.

AMMC also spent nearly $32 million on ""digital list rental"" and related services.

One glaring omission: The Texas-based mobile-application company Phunware appears nowhere in the Trump campaign's public spending-disclosure reports.

That's despite Phunware, in a case-study document this month discovered by Insider, saying it forged a ""strategic relationship"" with AMMC on the ""development, launch and ongoing management and evolution"" of Trump campaign mobile apps. Phunware said it sent about 42.6 million push notifications to users of the Trump campaign apps it developed and also credited its products for driving 166,535 users to the Trump campaign's donation page.

Where AMMC's money went from there is still largely a secret closely guarded by a small group.

The Trump campaign's TV ad-buying firm, National Media, charged a 1.9% fee for buying airtime across the country, according to Trump advisors familiar with the arrangement. The fee is considered reasonable by Republican consultants who spoke with Insider for this story. The Trump campaign approved the ad spending, transferred the money to AMMC, and AMMC paid National Media.

But the ads didn't always cost the campaign just a 1.9% commission. Whenever Jamestown Associates, where Miller worked for years before joining Trump, made an ad it collected a video-production fee — and an additional 2% commission on every one of its ads that aired, according to Trump advisors familiar with the arrangement.

Combined, the Jamestown ads ended up costing the campaign a 3.9% commission: 1.9% for National Media to buy the airtime and an additional 2% commission for Jamestown when it aired.

In addition to the commission, Jamestown also charged the Trump campaign $35,000 a month to pay for Miller's campaign salary, according to Trump advisors familiar with the arrangement.

Miller did not return requests for comment from Insider. But one Trump advisor said they didn't see anything wrong with the arrangement, in part because it was well-known inside the campaign and nobody tried to hide it internally.

The Trump campaign never publicly disclosed Miller's campaign salary, just as it did not disclose the salaries of Guilfoyle and Lara Trump. Miller's salary is significantly higher than what the Trump campaign paid any other campaign staffer among those whose salaries were publicly disclosed, such as Murtaugh and chief strategist Michael Glassner, who each earned a paycheck of just under $10,500 every two weeks.

By contrast, the nominal president of the Trump campaign shell company, Sean Dollman, the Trump campaign's chief financial officer, was paid directly by the Trump campaign in publicly available payments disclosed to the FEC. Trump advisors who spoke with Insider said Dollman wasn't calling the shots on how to run the shell company. Instead, it was Trump's family deciding what would route through AMMC, the advisors said.

That's the spending Insider could identify through interviews and public records. The rest of the money spent through AMMC is, as one Trump advisor, a ""black hole."" The campaign brass knew who was getting the other $367 million from the AMMC pie.

The Trump campaign reported the broad categories of spending. But where it went from there was sometimes a mystery — even to people who worked there. Many of Trump's top advisors told Insider they didn't mind not peeling back the curtain on how Trump's family oversaw millions of dollars in spending.

""The campaign leadership made a decision that looking in the past made zero sense,"" a third Trump advisor said. ""There was zero sense or necessity in looking backward."""
Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Fetterman relentlessly trolls Dan Patrick seeking $1M voter fraud bounty,341,kiy6gl,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Pennsylvania-Lt-Gov-Fetterman-relentlessly-15822777.php,29,1608776228.0,,"WASHINGTON — All John Fetterman wants for Christmas is the $3 million he says Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick owes him.

The Democratic lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania has been trolling his Republican counterpart for weeks to collect on the $1 million Patrick offered in November for evidence of fraud in the Nov. 3 election. Three supporters of President Donald Trump have now been charged in separate voter fraud schemes in Pennsylvania. Fetterman says they should all count for bounty purposes.

The most recent charges came this week — against the second Pennsylvania man to be accused of casting a ballot for Trump in the name of his deceased mother.

“We hit the jackpot with this last one,” Fetterman said. “There are three documented cases — three.”

VOTER FRAUD IN TEXAS: Ken Paxton’s beefed-up 2020 elections unit closed just 16 minor cases

“All I want for Christmas is my handsome reward from Dan Patrick,” Fetterman tweeted on Dec. 18 with a Christmas tree and pleading face emoji. Fetterman says he’ll donate the proceeds to food banks in the form of gift cards to Sheetz and Wawa, competing Pennsylvania convenience stores with die-hard followings.

Patrick has responded to Fetterman just once, in a tweet in November that read: “Faith in the electoral process is a serious issue. Transparency is critical. PA Dems brought this on themselves w/ last minute changes to election laws and counting ballots behind closed doors. Respond to the reports. Answer the questions. Stop the snide put-downs and #getserious”

Fetterman says he is serious — about debunking the false allegations being thrown at his state. He has taken the lead in Pennsylvania pushing back on bogus claims of voter fraud circulated by Trump and his allies. Patrick — honorary chairman of Trump’s campaign in Texas — and his million-dollar reward are helping to disprove those claims, Fetterman says.

“While it’s undoubtedly and undeniably hilarious these cases involved Trump voters and their dead mothers, it’s irrelevant because it documents how truly rare voter fraud is and how impossible it is to truly pull it off,” Fetterman said.

Fetterman has spent the last six weeks hounding Patrick, who he says is “just such a Trump simp, it’s just pathetic.”

“The thing that’s so especially galling is that people like him were smearing our state when we actually had an impeccable election,” Fetterman said. “They keep trying to malign and smear the quality work done by both sides — we’ve got way more Republican counties than Democratic counties. He’s smearing Republicans and Democrats alike when he impugns the electoral integrity.”

“If you’re going to smear my state, then you need to pay up, because we delivered what you asked for,” he said.

Sherry Sylvester, a spokeswoman for Patrick, responded: “It is not clear why Lt. Gov. Fetterman continues on this topic since Democrats don’t believe in voter fraud — unless it’s the Russians.”

“Fetterman should actually read Lt. Governor Patrick’s offer before calling reporters,” Sylvester said. “Lt. Gov. Patrick said he would pay $25,000 to $1 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of voter fraud — the same standard used for rewards from Crime Stoppers programs across the nation.”

She would not say whether any tips have led to payments.

Fetterman said he’s never met Patrick, who first came across his radar in March when Patrick appeared on Fox News during COVID lockdowns and suggested grandparents might be willing to sacrifice themselves to reopen the country. Patrick’s comments went viral.

Then came Patrick’s offer on Nov. 10 to pay up to $1 million for “information that leads to an arrest and final conviction of voter fraud.”

“I’d like to collect your handsome reward for reporting voter fraud,” Fetterman wrote on Twitter. “I got a dude in Forty Fort, PA who tried to have his dead mom vote for Trump.”

He was referring to a case from September in which a 67-year-old man was charged with forging the name of his deceased mother to get an application for an absentee ballot.

Then, in November, police filed criminal charges against a 71-year-old Willistown man who they say cast a ballot for Trump, then returned to the polling place 45 minutes later, this time wearing sunglasses and claiming to be his son, and voted for Trump again.

Police on Monday announced charges against a 70-year-old Delaware County man they say cast a ballot for Trump in the name of his long-dead mother.

Fetterman started a Twitter poll asking his followers which case is their favorite: “Dude in Forty Fort,” “Returns in sunglasses” or “It’s Bartman!!” referring to the name of the most recent voter to face charges.

“2/3 involve dead moms … ALL 3 Trump voters,” Fetterman said in a text. “All improbably hilarious.”

On Tuesday he tweeted: “Hopefully NOW @DanPatrick will pay the people of Pennsylvania the handsome reward it deserves for rooting out voter fraud.”

"Trump announces wave of pardons, including Papadopoulos and former lawmakers Hunter and Collins",54,kiixhd,https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/22/politics/trump-pardons/index.html,9,1608715325.0,,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a wave of lame duck pardons, including two for men who pleaded guilty in Robert Mueller's investigation , as well as ones for Republican allies who once served in Congress and military contractors involved in a deadly shooting of Iraqi civilians.

The pardons of former campaign aide George Papadopoulos , former US congressmen Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins , and the four Blackwater guards involved in the Iraq massacre kick off what is expected to be a flurry of pardons and commutations in the coming weeks as Trump concludes his term.

Also included in the batch announced on Tuesday are Alex van der Zwaan , the Dutch lawyer who was sentenced to 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to lying to Mueller investigators; two Border Patrol agents convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed undocumented immigrant and then covering it up; and several people convicted of non-violent drug crimes serving lengthy sentences.

The pardons came at the recommendation of Trump allies in Congress and, in some cases, the conservative media. Many of the non-violent drug offenders were recommended for clemency by Alice Johnson , the former federal inmate whose sentence Trump commuted at the urging of Kim Kardashian West.

The announcement Tuesday also included commuting the remaining prison term of former Rep. Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican who was convicted by a jury in Texas of almost two dozen felonies, including fraud and money laundering.

In the release, the White House cited Stockman's age, 64, and said he ""has underlying pre-existing health conditions that place his health at greater risk during the COVID epidemic , and he has already contracted COVID while in prison."" He had served two years of his 10-year sentence for what prosecutors called a ""a white-collar crime spree.""

Others included in the clemency batch on Tuesday were pardons for Alfonso Costa, a dentist who pleaded guilty to health care fraud; Alfred Lee Crum, who pleaded guilty in 1952 to illegally distilling moonshine; Weldon Angelos, who was sentenced to 55 years in prison for selling marijuana and carrying a handgun; Philip Lyman, a county commissioner in Utah who was sentenced to 10 days in jail related to his protest of ATV restrictions on federal land; and Otis Gordon, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute.

Philip Esformes, a Florida nursing home mogul convicted of paying bribes in a Medicare fraud case, also had some of his sentence commuted by Trump.

Trump also reduced the sentences of three women -- Crystal Munoz, Tynice Nichole Hall and Judith Negron -- convicted of drug crimes at the recommendation of Johnson, who has worked on behalf of other inmates after the President commuted her own sentence. Trump later granted Johnson a full pardon at this year's Republican National Convention.

Mueller investigation pardons

George Papadopoulos visits ""The Story With Martha MacCallum"" at Fox News Studios on March 26, 2019 in New York City.

The pardons give forgiveness to two early defendants who pleaded guilty and served prison time in the Mueller investigation: 2016 campaign foreign policy adviser Papadopoulos and Van der Zwaan, who was part of a major investigation by Mueller into illegal foreign lobbying efforts and the Ukrainian and Russian connections of Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort.

Both Papadopoulos and Van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to lying to investigators during the Russia investigation. And neither provided Mueller with any meaningful cooperation, prosecutors said.

Papadopoulos had lied to investigators about his contacts with people connected to Russia, including discussing with them ""dirt"" that could hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a possible trip by Trump during the campaign to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.

At his sentencing, Papadopoulos' then-lawyer called him ""pro-FBI"" and said he had lied so he might still be considered for a job in the Trump administration. The defense lawyer, Thomas Breen, effectively blamed Trump for publicly urging people such as Papadopoulos to disregard the Russia investigators. ""The President of the United States hindered this investigation more than George Papadopoulos ever could,"" Breen argued.

""I made a terrible mistake,"" Papadopoulos told the judge during his sentencing hearing. ""In hindsight, lying to federal agents about such a critical issue could have harmed our nation.""

He spent less than two weeks in prison in late 2018. Since then, he's railed against the investigators and how they caught him.

Van der Zwaan, who is also the son-in-law of the Ukrainian-Russian billionaire German Khan, spent almost a month in prison before being deported to Europe in June 2018. He showed ""muted"" remorse at his sentencing, the judge noted.

Attorney Alex van der Zwaan leaves U.S District Court after pleading guilty during a scheduled appearance February 20, 2018 in Washington, DC.

""This is not something that happened to him. This is something he did,"" federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Van der Zwaan's sentencing. ""He put his personal interest ahead of the interest of justice.""

More recently, Papadopoulos ran for Congress in California's 25th District in 2019 following Democratic Rep. Katie Hill's resignation. He lost the race for the open seat in the March primary.

Former congressmen pardoned

Hunter, who was sentenced earlier this year to 11 months in prison and three years of supervised release related to his misuse of more than $200,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses, was recommended for a pardon by ""many members of Congress,"" according to the White House release.

The former California lawmaker pleaded guilty in December 2019 to one count of conspiracy to misuse campaign funds and was set to be on supervised release for three years after serving his prison sentence. He was also required to participate in a drug and alcohol treatment program. Hunter would have started his sentence in May, but it was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, and he would have reported to a federal prison in West Texas in January 2021.

Hunter and his wife were indicted in August 2018 for lavishly spending on ""items as inconsequential as fast food, movie tickets and sneakers; as trivial as video games, Lego sets and Playdoh; as mundane as groceries, dog food, and utilities; and as self-indulgent as luxury hotels, overseas vacations, and plane tickets for themselves, their family members, and their pet rabbits Eggburt and Cadbury,"" according to prosecutors.

Federal prosecutors charged that Hunter had fraudulently spent more than $200,000 on expenses that included a $14,000 Italian vacation and thousands of dollars on routine items like groceries, bedding and other household items.

Hunter resigned from Congress in January, after winning reelection in California's 50th Congressional District, which encompasses much of eastern San Diego County.

Collins, a former New York congressman, has been serving his 26-month prison sentence in a minimum-security federal prison in Florida since October.

Collins pleaded guilty in October 2019 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of making a false statement.

While attending the White House's annual congressional picnic in June 2017, Collins had shared non-public information with his son Cameron about the failed trial results for a multiple sclerosis drug the Australian biotech company Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited, of which he was a board member, was developing. He later lied to FBI agents to cover it up. The stock trades allowed Cameron Collins, a co-defendant in the case, to avoid over $750,000 in losses, according to federal prosecutors. Collins himself did not trade on the information.

Collins had initially fought the charges against him, calling them ""meritless"" when they were first brought in 2018. He even won reelection while under indictment. But in his guilty plea last year in federal court, Collins expressed regret and said that putting his son ""in this jeopardy at this young age ... is something I will live with for the rest of my life.""

Collins resigned from Congress on September 30, 2019, a day before his guilty plea. He had represented New York's 27th Congressional District for nearly seven years.

Blackwater guards

This combination made from file photo shows Blackwater guards, from left, Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty, Nicholas Slatten and Paul Slough.

The four Blackwater guards — Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty, and Dustin Heard — were convicted by a federal jury in 2014 after a lengthy trial that saw some 30 witnesses travel from Iraq to testify against them. Prosecutors accused the men of illegally unleashing ""powerful sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers on innocent men, women and children.""

According to prosecutors, the four were among seven Blackwater employees who opened fire in the Nusoor Square traffic circle in Baghdad, killing 17 people.

An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. Slatten was accused of firing the first shots.

Blackwater said its convoy came under attack, and defense attorneys said in court that witness accounts were fabricated. But witnesses testified that the contractors opened fire without provocation.

The White House said their pardons were supported by a number of members of Congress along with Pete Hegseth, the conservative Fox News host who is an ally of the President's.

The controversial private security firm was founded by Erik Prince, the brother of Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos

Border Patrol agents

The two Border Patrol agents, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, received 11- and 12-year prison sentences for their role in the 2006 shooting. Their sentences were later reduced through presidential commutation by George W. Bush.

The shooting happened February 17, 2005, on the US-Mexico border southeast of El Paso, Texas. During their trial, Ramos and Compean said that the illegal immigrant, Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, had brandished a gun while actively resisting arrest.

Aldrete-Davila said, however, that he was unarmed and trying to surrender when Compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun.

Aldrete-Davila was shot while fleeing toward the Rio Grande. Ramos and Compean were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure.

After receiving immunity to testify in the case against the two agents, Aldrete-Davila was arrested in 2007 on charges of bringing more than 750 pounds of marijuana into the United States.

The case became a political flashpoint, with advocates of tighter border controls defending the agents and civil liberties groups saying that the agents had used illegal and excessive force against Aldrete-Davila.

The omnibus bill, comprised of a $1.4 trillion spending bill and a $900 billion stimulus plan, was approved on Monday night following months of negotiations.

The bill grants most Americans direct payments of $600, with unemployment benefits rising to $300 a week. However, it contains a number of seemingly bizarre provisions.

$35 million is to be set aside for sexual-abstinence schemes, and illegal streaming is now a felony. A provision also states that China must have no role in choosing the next Dalai Lama.

The omnibus spending bill passed by Congress on Monday night includes an unexpected array of provisions including $2 billion for the US Space Force, $35 million for sexual-abstinence programs, and a tax break for owners of racehorses.

The House and the Senate approved a $1.4 trillion spending bill and a $900 billion COVID-19 relief package on Monday night following months of fraught negotiations.

US businesses and individuals have for months been clamoring for financial aid in the face of devastating damage done to the economy by the coronavirus pandemic.

The $900 billion relief package includes $600 direct payments to Americans earning below $75,000, and $300 weekly federal unemployment benefits. The bill also extends the eviction ban that was set to expire on December 31, 2020.

But a number of provisions contained in the spending bill — the longest ever greenlit by Congress — have drawn confusion and outrage.

Among the more obscure provisions, some of which appear totally unrelated to the pandemic, are:

A provision for $2.4 billion to be given to the Space Force.

A measure stating that China must have no role in choosing the next Dalai Lama and that decisions on the ""reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should be made solely by faith leaders."" (Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama, is 85.)

$35 million in funding for sexual-abstinence programs that ""exclusively implement education in sexual risk avoidance (defined as voluntarily refraining from non marital sexual activity.)""

Provisions for a tax break for owners of racehorses.

Permission granted for the creation of a Smithsonian American Women's History Museum and a National Museum of the American Latino.

A provision of $4 billion to the US Navy for weapons procurement.

A provision of $500 million to Israel and Jordan.

A provision declaring that illegal streaming is now a felony.

The obscure provisions were ridiculed by politicians on social media.

Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted that the $2 billion provision for the US Space Force was ""pathetic,"" while GOP Rep. Ken Buck tweeted sarcastically: ""The COVID relief we've all been waiting for: a tax break for racehorse owners.""

Members of the House and Senate had only a handful of hours to read the 5,593-page bill before they were expected to vote on it.

On Monday night, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the time frame was effectively ""hostage-taking"" and allowed no time for proper scrutiny.

In the tweet, Ocasio-Cortez shared a link to a news article about the new ban on illegal streaming.

""This is why Congress needs time to actually read this package before voting on it. Members of Congress have not read this bill. It's over 5,000 pages, arrived at 2pm today, and we are told to expect a vote on it in 2 hours,"" she wrote.

Some coronavirus-related provisions did not make in into the final bill either.

The U.S. government does not intend to impose Covid-19 screenings for passengers traveling from Britain after the emergence of a highly infectious new coronavirus variant there, people briefed on the decision said.

White House coronavirus task force members backed requiring negative pre-flight tests after a meeting on Monday, but the Trump administration has decided not to take any action for the time being, the people said.

Much of the world shut their borders to Britain after the discovery of a mutated variant of the novel coronavirus, though the European Union recommended on Tuesday that members roll back sweeping closures to allow freight to resume and people to return home for Christmas.

Several airlines are requiring New York-arriving passengers from the U.K. to get negative Covid-19 tests within 72 hours of departure after a request from the state's governor.

The Trump administration has repeatedly refused to issue mandates for many federal Covid-19 safety policies for air travel, making only strong recommendations on issues such as mask wearing. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to mandate masks in interstate air, bus and train travel after taking office on Jan. 20.

The White House in August scuttled an effort to require airlines to collect contact tracing information from U.S.-bound international passengers, Reuters reported.

The White House in July rejected a proposal to require facial coverings at U.S. airports, train and transit stations and onboard airplanes, trains and transit services and earlier dismissed proposals to require temperature checks of airline passengers.

"Officials finally found a case of a dead person voting, accusing a Republican of pretending to be his dead mom to vote for Trump",573,ki85jh,https://www.businessinsider.com/voter-election-fraud-pennsylvania-charge-dead-mom-vote-trump-2020-12,33,1608681989.0,,"Bruce Bartman, a 70-year-old from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, has been charged with voter fraud.

He pretended to be his dead mom to vote for President Donald Trump in the 2020 election and registered his dead mother-in-law to vote, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said it was the only voter-fraud case they found after hundreds of tips.

Voter fraud is extremely rare in the US, but Republicans have claimed it's a major problem and sought to pass laws restricting voting.

Officials have found a case of a dead person voting.

Bruce Bartman has been charged with unlawful voting and perjury over allegations that he pretended to be his dead mother to cast a ballot in the November election for President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania.

Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer announced the charges in a press release Monday. Bartman was arraigned Friday and released on $100,000 bail, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. If convicted on all charges, the 70-year-old Bartman could spend up to 19 years in prison.

""This is the only known case of a 'dead person' voting in our county, conspiracy theories notwithstanding,"" Stollsteimer said in a statement. ""Further, the prompt prosecution of this case shows that law enforcement will continue to uphold our election laws whenever presented with actual evidence of fraud and that we will continue to investigate every allegation that that comes our way.""

Prosecutors said Bartman registered two dead people — his mother, Elizabeth Bartman, and his mother-in-law, Elizabeth Weihman — as Republican voters in August. He used the state's online voter-registration portal, which allows residents to register to vote using their driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number, prosecutors said.

He used his mother-in-law's Social Security number to register, which was flagged in the state system as belonging to someone who is dead, prosecutors added, but the software sent a letter addressed to her to confirm whether she was alive. Bartman lied on the form and pretended to be Weihman, prosecutors said, but ultimately did not request an absentee ballot in her name.

Bartman also registered his dead mother to vote and successfully cast a ballot for Trump and other Republicans in her name, prosecutors said.

Voter fraud is extremely rare in the US. A database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation found only 193 convicted cases of voter fraud between 2000 and 2020, during which about 250 million votes were cast. Republicans frequently make baseless claims that voter fraud has a larger scope and scale, while pushing for laws that would make it harder for people to vote.

""For all the conspiracy theorists out there, this case today does not represent widespread voter fraud,"" Stollsteimer told The Philadelphia Inquirer. ""This case was evidence that one person committed voter fraud by casting an improper and illegal ballot.""

President-elect Joe Biden won Delaware County by about 78,000 votes and won the overall popular vote by about 7 million votes. Trump and his political allies have filed 40 lawsuits challenging election results — some of them alleging fraud — and none of them have succeeded.

In Delaware County, a task force composed of prosecutors, detectives, and other investigators has looked into voter-fraud complaints made to the board of elections.

Out of the hundreds of tips it received, Bartman was the only one that was substantiated, First Assistant District Attorney Tanner Rouse told The Inquirer.

""In the hundreds of calls we received and the hundreds of visits we made, we only found one instance of malfeasance, and that was Mr. Bartman,"" Rouse said. ""And he will be prosecuted.""

Samuel Stretton, Bartman's lawyer, told The Inquirer his client took responsibility for his actions.

""In his political frustration, he chose to do something stupid,"" Stretton told The Inquirer. ""And for that he is very sorry."""

WASHINGTON (AP) — The $900 billion pandemic relief package that was rushed through Congress Monday created a familiar year-end conundrum for lawmakers: It was a bill too big to fail, and also too big to read.

Delivering virus aid to the country required a leap of faith for lawmakers as they cast their votes, practically sight unseen, for a sprawling, 5,593-page bill that linked the pandemic aid with a $1.4 trillion annual spending bill to fund the government. The Senate Historical Office says it’s the longest bill they could find record of passing Congress.

“I think if we provide everyone a paper copy we would have to destroy an entire forest,” joked House Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, responding to a Republican request for a hard copy of the legislation Monday afternoon. The bill was released at 2 p.m., just hours before the House and Senate began voting on it.

Also in the bill: hundreds of unrelated legislative items negotiated by leadership to win support from various constituencies. It includes extended tax breaks for the alcohol industry and motor speedways, comprehensive energy legislation, revised copyright rules, approval of two new Smithsonian museums and lessened penalties for the transportation of water hyacinths. There’s also an entire section on Tibet, including a statement of U.S. policy on how to determine the country’s next spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and the decriminalization of the use of the Swiss coat of arms.

It was a dizzying if familiar finish in the Capitol, where lawmakers often procrastinate on passing bills — even those with broad support — until they are on the cusp of heading home for a holiday break. It’s why such bills are often called “Christmas trees,” trimmed with legislative ornaments, and stand among the most glaring symptoms of a broken Congress where the two parties can’t agree until they absolutely have to.

Still, the package was an extraordinary response to the global pandemic — the second major bill this year — and was negotiated almost entirely behind closed doors by congressional leadership. And because it includes long-awaited virus relief for businesses and individuals, all the additional items were catching a free ride to President Donald Trump’s desk.

Though the legislation passed with large margins in both the House and Senate, members of both parties expressed frustration with the process.

“NOT ONE Member of Congress will have had time to read through it before voting later today,” tweeted Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. “This is awful governance, and a disservice to the American people.”

Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York echoed that thought: “It’s not good enough to hear about what’s in the bill,” she tweeted just before it was released. “Members of Congress need to see & read the bills we are expected to vote on. I know it’s ‘controversial’ & I get in trouble for sharing things like this, but the people of this country deserve to know. They deserve better.”

Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., said: “I can’t in good faith vote for legislation of this magnitude without first thoroughly examining its contents and how it affects North Carolinians and their futures.” He called a $600 check for individuals suffering economically “too little, too late.”

Some of the unrelated items weren’t controversial. There’s relief for victims of steep surprise medical bills and the approval of the two museums that will honor American Latinos and women. A Republican senator blocked the two museums earlier this month even though they have broad bipartisan support.

Other items in the package hadn’t passed on their own due to partisan bickering that stalled much of the Senate’s work. They included clean energy provisions, the result of a bipartisan compromise, and legislation renewing the nation’s intelligence programs. The bill also overhauls the aircraft certification process in the wake of crashes of Boeing 737 MAX planes — legislation that the House Transportation Committee called “one of the most significant overhauls to the FAA certification reform process in recent history.”

Several high-ticket items won inclusion, including an almost 400-page water resources bill that targets $10 billion for 46 Army Corps of Engineers flood control, environmental and coastal protection projects. There was also $7 billion to increase access to broadband, $4 billion to help other nations vaccinate their people and $14 billion for cash-starved transit systems, Amtrak and airports.

And then there were the smaller items stowed away in the thousands of pages — important to some lawmakers, but unlikely to win coveted floor time in a freestanding bill.

One section repealed a variety of little-known criminal penalties for minor violations, including the transportation of the water hyacinths and the use of the Swiss coat of arms. The section also decriminalizes the unauthorized application of theft prevention decals or devices, and the unauthorized use of the 4-H Club emblem, the “Smokey Bear” character, the “Woodsy Owl” character or “The Golden Eagle Insignia.”

Though most of the items were listed in lengthy bill summaries, it was unlikely that most lawmakers would even know those things were there.

“Here are the 5,593 pages of language which I’m now perusing and on which we’ll be voting in about six hours,” tweeted Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, a Democrat who worked on the virus relief compromise.

Phillips asked where he could find Evelyn Wood, the late American educator who popularized speed reading.

"Protesters clash with police, smash glass doors, disrupt lawmakers on 'unnerving' day at Oregon State Capitol in Salem",168,ki2adz,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/21/oregon-police-arrests-covid-protests-salem-capitol/4003055001/,27,1608659149.0,,"CLOSE Lockdown protesters tried to break into the Oregon State Capitol during a COVID-19 relief special session. Four were reportedly arrested. USA TODAY

SALEM, Ore. – A special session of the state Legislature was disrupted Monday by protesters opposed to policies designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Protesters broke glass doors at the largely empty Capitol building, tore tarps from the marble reliefs on the front steps and engaged in a brief standoff with Oregon State Police and Salem Police Department officers.

Police made at least four arrests during the six-hour rally that included more than 100 protesters, including members of the far-right Patriot Prayer group.

A search is ongoing for another man who attacked two reporters and tried to break into the Capitol building, police said.

""We're standing up for our constitutional rights to be here for this legislative hearing and for our rights to reopen the state of Oregon,"" Crystal Wagner said. ""Why are they having a legislative hearing without the people? We are the people, we are the taxpayers. We're here to fight for our democracy.""

What is Patriot Prayer? Who is Joey Gibson? What we know about this right-wing group

Aside from dozens of police officers, some staff and reporters were the only ones permitted inside the building Monday.

At around 8:30 a.m., Oregon State Police said protesters entered the Capitol, and at least one used ""chemical agents"" on officers. OSP troopers responded, though it is unclear how many pepper balls were fired.

An unlawful assembly was declared at around 9:20 a.m.

“At one point, we used pepper balls. I don’t know what else,"" Salem Police Lt. Treven Upkes said. ""When people attempted to come into the building, they actually used pepper spray and other things on officers. In return, we used those to separate ourselves and get them to hold that spot. So I don’t know what all was used, but I know at least pepper ball was used.""

He said, ""There may have been other chemical munitions used by the crowd as well on us that seemed to have acted similar to … a CS gas.""

Just before 11 a.m., a few protesters unlocked the gated fence surrounding the Capitol steps and began to remove a tarp covering two marble reliefs that were defaced during left-wing protests this summer.

About 2½ hours later, protesters smashed glass doors on the west end of the Capitol, attempting to enter the building.

As protesters swarmed the doors, a photographer for the Statesman Journal of the USA TODAY Network was repeatedly shoved. The photographer captured shots of protesters damaging the glass doors.

A short time later, there was a brief standoff between protesters and police department officers in SWAT gear at a nearby intersection.

""Do what's right,"" one protester said to the officers. ""You can stand with us.""

“It’s unnerving,” said State Sen. Shemia Fagan, D-Portland, who will be sworn in as secretary of state in January. “It doesn’t feel normal. And it feels really sad.""

The Oregon Legislature met Monday to consider extending the emergency eviction moratorium and providing funds to tenants and landlords amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cohen says he deserves early release from home confinement,8,khqppu,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-campaign-finance-prisons-campaigns-tax-evasion-94ba831049fac2ea0e0a8f8f7bcac300,3,1608615001.0,,"NEW YORK (AP) — Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, says he deserves early release from home confinement but federal authorities refuse to credit him for good behavior and hundreds of hours of work and prison courses completed behind bars. Cohen filed court papers Monday contending he “could be eligible for release in a matter of weeks or months” under the First Step Act, a sweeping criminal justice reform Trump signed into law in 2018.

Once one of Trump’s closest advisers, Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison after pleading guilty to tax evasion, campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. His convictions included orchestrating payments to two women to keep them from talking publicly about alleged affairs with Trump.

Cohen had been scheduled to remain in prison until next November, but was released in May to serve the remainder of his sentence at home as part of an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19 in federal prisons.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons, Cohen said, told him in a letter last week that he is “not entitled to any credits for his work performed at FCI Otisville,” the federal lockup in New York where he served more than a year.

Cohen said the letter left him “at a loss” and did not address time credits owed to him under the First Step Act, which encourages inmates to participate in programs aimed at reducing recidivism.

“This absurd response by the government is nothing more than a stonewall tactic,” Cohen wrote in the filings. It’s possible, he added, “that he has already served well past his release date.”

The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

After his initial release, Cohen returned to prison for two weeks in July after an earlier run-in with the Bureau of Prisons. Prison officials said Cohen had refused to sign routine paperwork. Cohen said the prison system wanted him to agree not to publish a tell-all memoir ahead of the November presidential election. He was sent back to his Manhattan apartment after a judge ruled he had faced retaliation."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The most improbable of presidents, Donald Trump reshaped the office and shattered its centuries-old norms and traditions while dominating the national discourse like no one before.

Trump, governing by whim and tweet, deepened the nation’s racial and cultural divides and undermined faith in its institutions. His legacy: a tumultuous four years that were marked by his impeachment, failures during the worst pandemic in a century and his refusal to accept defeat.

He smashed conceptions about how presidents behave and communicate, offering unvarnished thoughts and policy declarations alike, pulling back the curtain for the American people while enthralling supporters and unnerving foes — and sometimes allies — both at home and abroad.

While the nation would be hardpressed to elect another figure as disruptive as Trump, it remains to be seen how much of his imprint on the office itself, occupied by only 44 other men, will be indelible. Already it shadows the work of his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, who framed his candidacy as a repudiation of Trump, offering himself as an antidote to the chaos and dissent of the past four years while vowing to restore dignity to the Oval Office.

“For all four years, this is someone who at every opportunity tried to stretch presidential power beyond the limits of the law,” said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “He altered the presidency in many ways, but many of them can be changed back almost overnight by a president who wants to make the point that there is a change.”

Trump’s most enduring legacy may be his use of the trappings of the presidency to erode Americans’ views of the institutions of their own government.

From his first moments in office, Trump waged an assault on the federal bureaucracy, casting a suspicious eye on career officials he deemed the “Deep State” and shaking Americans’ confidence in civil servants and the levers of government. Believing that the investigation into Russian election interference was a crusade to undermine him, Trump went after the intelligence agencies and Justice Department — calling out leaders by name — and later unleashed broadsides against the man running the probe, respected special counsel Robert Mueller.

His other targets were legion: the Supreme Court for insufficient loyalty; the post office for its handling of mail-in ballots; even the integrity of the vote itself with his baseless claims of election fraud.

“In the past, presidents who lost were always willing to turn the office over to the next person. They were willing to accept the vote of the American public,” said Richard Waterman, who studies the presidency at the University of Kentucky. “What we’re seeing right now is really an assault on the institutions of democracy.”

Current polling suggests that many Americans, and a majority of Republicans, feel that Biden was illegitimately elected, damaging his credibility as he takes office during a crisis and also creating a template of deep suspicion for future elections.

“That’s a cancer,” Waterman said. “I don’t know if the cancer can be removed from the presidency without doing damage to the office itself. I think he’s done tremendous damage in the last several weeks.”

Jeopardizing the peaceful transfer of power was hardly Trump’s first assault on the traditions of the presidency.

He didn’t release his tax returns or divest himself from his businesses. He doled out government resources on a partisan basis and undermined his own scientists. He rage tweeted at members of his own party and used government property for political purposes, including the White House as the backdrop for his renomination acceptance speech.

Trump used National Guard troops to clear a largely peaceful protest across from the White House for a photo-op. He named a secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, who needed a congressional waiver to serve because the retired general had not been out of uniform for the seven years required by law. In that one example, Biden has followed Trump’s lead, nominating for Pentagon chief retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, who also will need a waiver.

Trump’s disruption extended to the global stage as well, where he cast doubt on once-inviolable alliances like NATO and bilateral partnerships with a host of allies. His “America First” foreign policy emanated more from preconceived notions of past slights than current facts on the ground. He unilaterally pulled troops from Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq and Syria, each time drawing bipartisan fire for undermining the very purpose of the American deployment.

He pulled out of multinational environmental agreements, an action that scientists warn may have accelerated climate change. He stepped away from accords that kept Iran’s nuclear ambitions, if not its regional malevolence, in check.

And his presidency may be remembered for altering, perhaps permanently, the nature of the U.S.-China relationship, dimming hopes for a peaceful emergence of China as a world power and laying the foundation for a new generation of economic and strategic rivalry.

While historians agree that Trump was a singular figure in the office, it will be decades before the consequences of his tenure are fully known. But some pieces of his legacy already are in place.

He named three Supreme Court justices and more than 220 federal judges, giving the judiciary an enduring conservative bent. He rolled back regulations and oversaw an economy that boomed until the pandemic hit. His presence increased voter turnout — both for and against him — to record levels. He received unwavering loyalty from his own party but was quick to cast aside any who displeased him.

“President Trump has been the person who has returned power to the American people, not the Washington elite, and preserved our history and institutions, while others have tried to tear them down,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. “The American people elected a successful businessman who promised to go to Washington, not to tear it down, but to put them first.”

At times, Trump acted like a bystander to his own presidency, opting to tweet along with a cable news segment rather than dive into an effort to change policy. And that was one of the many ways Trump changed the way that presidents communicate.

Carefully crafted policy statements took a back seat, replaced by tweets and off-the-cuff remarks to reporters over the whir of helicopter blades. The discourse hardened, with swear words, personal insults and violent imagery infiltrating the presidential lexicon. And there were the untruths — more than 23,000, according to a count by The Washington Post — that Trump tossed out with little regard for their impact.

It was that lack of honesty that played a role in his defeat in an election that became a referendum on how he had managed the COVID-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 300,000 Americans.

Day after day during his reelection campaign, Trump defied health guidelines and addressed packed, largely mask-less crowds, promising the nation was “rounding the corner” on the virus. He admitted that from the beginning, he set out to play down the seriousness of the virus.

He held superspreader events at the White House and contracted the virus himself. And while his administration spearheaded Operation Warp Speed, which helped to produce coronavirus vaccines in record time, Trump also undermined his public health officials by refusing to embrace mask-wearing and suggesting unproven treatments, including the injection of disinfectant.

“We have seen that Donald Trump’s style was one of the contributing factors to his failure as a president,” said Mark K. Updegrove, presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. “His successor can look at his presidency as a cautionary tale.”"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

Jeanne Bradley, a Republican voter from Hephzibah, Ga., is confused by the mixed messages she's hearing about the election and about her state's GOP leaders.

""We need to know more. You're getting bits and pieces from all of the news media, and you don't know what to believe anymore,"" she said. ""And it's not just the news media. It's people in general.""

It's also President Trump.

He narrowly lost the state to President-elect Joe Biden, but he's rejected that outcome and continues a pressure campaign on Georgia's Republican leaders to overturn the result.

Trump has called Gov. Brian Kemp, a longtime ally with whom he has had some previous tensions, a ""clown"" and a ""fool,"" and he has referred to Kemp, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger as ""Republicans in name only.""

That's because those officials have stood by Georgia's election as legally conducted, in the face of unfounded claims of widespread fraud from the president. Legal challenges to the election from the Trump campaign and supporters have failed in federal, superior and state courts in Georgia. Multiple recounts have upheld the result.

But for some Republican voters, the confusion persists.

""We don't know,"" Bradley said. ""We don't know if it's just a ploy to get us not to vote Republican, too.""

Republicans still have Bradley's vote. But there are other people, she said, who may throw up their hands in this chaos, vote Democratic, or skip the election.

The GOP can't afford to lose any votes right now. Georgia's runoff elections on Jan. 5 will decide control of the U.S. Senate, as GOP incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler face Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively. And if the GOP loses those seats, handing Democrats total control of Washington, there's a risk that the divisions that Georgia has seen since November might intensify throughout the party.

Governor feels the heat

Kemp said that his response to voters who have told him he's not ""fighting for us"" has been: ""I am, but I can only fight so much because I've got to follow the laws and the Constitution.""

The president retweeted a post suggesting Kemp and Raffensperger should go to jail and has encouraged another Georgia Republican, Rep. Doug Collins, to run against Kemp in 2022.

Some Republican Georgia voters have adopted the campaign against their governor.

Lydia Green Davidson attended a Cobb County Republican rally in mid-December and said she plans to collect signatures to get Kemp impeached for not complying with Trump's demand to call a special session of the state legislature to overturn the election results from November or change the rules for the runoffs.

""I'm disgusted,"" said the retired teacher and 2018 Kemp voter. ""He won't be reelected. He'll be lucky if he stays in office, because he's going to be impeached.""

This division in the Republican Party is happening at a very inopportune time, says Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia.

""As we saw in November of this year, the Republican Party does not have a large commanding lead within Georgia. It is fairly close,"" he said. ""It could be the kind of division that opens the door for Democrats to do very well in 2022.""

""I take this job seriously""

There are some state lawmakers in Georgia who have supported the president's call for a special session to overturn the election, including Republican state Sen. Brandon Beach, who is among a handful of lawmakers recruiting signatures for a petition to call the special session independently of the governor.

""And I can tell you if we do not fix this, and that's why I'm so adamant about this, I'm so fearful that... we're going to wake up Jan. 6, and we're not going to like what happened because it's not going to be a fair election,"" Beach said about the campaign on the John Fredericks Show, a national pro-Trump radio program.

The case Beach and his colleagues are making for a special session relies on debunked theories about the election, including allegations that absentee ballot signatures were not matched properly and that absentee ballot drop boxes were insecure. Georgia's Republican election officials have repeatedly said there's been no evidence of widespread voter fraud.

Rampant misinformation about the election and the pressure from the president has put Georgia Republicans in a difficult situation, even though the petition for a special session has not succeeded.

State Rep. Chuck Martin, a longtime Republican and 18-year veteran of the General Assembly, called it the most frustrating time of his public service career.

Like Kemp, he's been a Trump supporter who doesn't believe the state constitution allows the legislature to intervene in legally held elections. But that hasn't stopped tens of thousands of emails from flowing in.

""I'm getting an email that says, 'Stand true to your oath of office: do this,' "" he said. ""But standing true to my oath of office doesn't allow me to do that.""

""And they're absolutely sure they're right and I'm wrong because of snippets they've read on the internet,"" Martin said.

One message came from a retired Army colonel pushing for the election to be overturned. Martin responded with language from the state constitution, asking for an explanation as to how he could legally do what the emailer was asking.

""And instead from him, I get no [explanation of] how,"" Martin said. ""Instead, he calls me a coward, a traitor ... somebody that won't stand up to my oath of office. That's frustrating to me. I take this job seriously.""

Some of the election misinformation has been targeted at Kemp and his family.

""Quite honestly, it has gotten ridiculous,"" the governor said. ""From death threats to [claims of] bribes from China, [to] the social media posts that my children are getting.""

""I mean, this needs to stop. People need to deal with facts, and we'll give them to them,"" he said.

""I know people think that as a United States senator, you're all powerful, and you can move the world,"" said former Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a Republican who represented Georgia. ""They also think when you're governor, you're all powerful, and you can move the world within the confines of the state of Georgia. But that's not right. You still have to abide by the laws that are on the books.""

Trump's ""magic"" put to the test

The runoff election results, which are expected to be close, will likely serve as a bellwether for the soon-to-be-former president's influence.

Political scientist Bullock said Trump will remain important for Republicans. ""Until someone disproves it, then there's going to be a lot of suspicion that he is very influential and that you have to be on his right side if you're a Republican,"" he said.

Bullock also said that will remain true until and unless his chosen candidate fails in a high-profile race. ""That would send [Republicans] a message well beyond the confines of Georgia, that Trump's influence, his magic, whatever, no longer exists,"" he said.

Chambliss said the president will remain an important influence because of his proven ability to generate unprecedented Republican turnout.

""Donald Trump is still technically the head of the Republican Party from a national perspective, and his thoughts and ideas need to be included in everything we do going forward,"" he said.

Chambliss is optimistic about Republicans' chances in January, despite the schism.

""We've always had factions within the party that we had to address, and we had to consider [them], we had to listen to their ideas. And that's what we have right now,"" he said.

""And I don't think it's going to handicap us going forward, provided we all continue to pull together and get out and vote in instances like Jan. 5."""

(Reuters) - Russia’s five-times world champion weightlifter and Olympic medallist Tatiana Kashirina has been temporarily suspended for an anti-doping rule violation, Russian news agency TASS reported on Sunday.

Kashirina, who won silver at the 2012 Olympics and five gold medals at the world championships between 2010 and 2018, was one of the favourites for a gold medal at next year’s Tokyo Games.

The report said Kashirina, 29, was suspended after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) took results of doping tests of Russian athletes between 2012 to 2015 from the Moscow Laboratory during an investigation.

She previously served a two-year suspension from 2006-08 for violating anti-doping rules and her latest ban will prevent her from competing during the Games qualification period which runs until April, 2021.

Kashirina would have had to compete as a neutral as Russian athletes remain barred from major international events, including the Olympics, under the country’s flag until 2022.

A Swiss court upheld doping sanctions on Russia this week but halved the original four-year WADA ban."
"Fired attorney Sidney Powell is back, advising Trump to chart a scorched-earth course",52,kgmrya,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fired-attorney-sidney-powell-back-advising-trump-chart/story?id=74823842,3,1608464098.0,,"Fired attorney Sidney Powell is back, advising Trump to chart a scorched-earth course Friday's Oval Office meeting with Trump ""must be condemned,"" a critic says.

President Donald Trump had cut attorney Sidney Powell from his legal team after she launched multiple lawsuits aimed at overturning the 2020 election -- all failures -- but Trump has now welcomed the conspiracy-minded flamethrower back into the White House to plot out further efforts to extend his presidency.

Trump and Powell met in the Oval Office Friday night, ABC News has confirmed, and were joined by Trump's former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has been publicly prodding Trump to take unprecedented steps to seize a second term -- including declaring martial law and ordering the military to oversee new elections in the battleground states that Trump lost.

""[Trump] could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states,"" Flynn said earlier this week on the conservative news outlet Newsmax.

Critics expressed alarm at Friday's meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times. Noah Bookbinder, who heads the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told ABC News that the ideas raised in the Oval Office discussions would represent an ""abuse of power"" and were ""wrong and must be condemned.""

""President Trump's continued attempts to overturn the results of the election have done immeasurable damage to the stability of our democracy and to the American people's faith in it,"" Bookbinder said. ""The president welcoming Michael Flynn to the White House right after Flynn suggested Trump impose martial law to overturn the election by force takes the threat to a new level.""

Critics contend that Powell's return could usher in a dark final chapter to the Trump presidency, and the prospect has prompted pointed objections from several of Trump's most trusted advisers -- including his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who has otherwise endorsed a scorched-earth effort to contest the elections.

And Powell's re-emergence in Trump's corner comes at a precarious time for her own career, as many of the targets of her drive to overturn the election have begun to push back. Last week, Dominion Voting Systems, the Colorado voting machine company that fringe pro-Trump forces have targeted with dark conspiracy theories of a rigged election, threatened Powell with legal action if she didn't retract what it called the ""wild, knowingly baseless, and false"" allegations she has made against them.

Nevertheless, Trump invited Powell to consider the possibility that she be appointed a special counsel and be given high-level security clearances to investigate the 2020 election. The meeting was highly contentious, sources told ABC News, filled with screaming and demands from Powell, who called other Trump aids ""quitters"" for giving up the fight.

The meeting ended with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and other Trump attorneys talking the president out of making the offer, the sources said. Giuliani, who joined the meeting by phone, also opposed the idea, according to sources.

Powell did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Powell's allure to Trump appears to be her willingness to explore debunked, stem-winding conspiracy theories suggesting that foreign actors plotted with an American deep state to rig election machines for former Vice President Joe Biden. During Friday's meeting, a source said, the assembled group pondered an executive order to seize and examine voting machines across the country.

That idea had initially been raised by Giuliani earlier in the week, but was quickly shot down by Cipollone and Meadows. When Powell raised it Friday night, the two dismissed it again.

""I don't even know how that would work,"" U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Commissioner Ben Hovland told ABC News. ""The voting machines are owned by the local jurisdictions in most cases; those are state and local property, so I don't even know how that makes sense.""

Over the past year, Powell has built a reputation for reaching beyond what other attorneys would consider. She took on Flynn's defense after the former national security adviser had pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents and been upbraided in court by a federal judge. Powell forged a new strategy: recant his plea and place the blame for his legal troubles on his prior defense lawyer and the FBI. The tactics were roundly criticized, but ended with the Justice Department withdrawing charges and Trump issuing Flynn a full pardon.

Powell has also been among the most vocal of Trump's advisers to promote the idea that his 2020 election defeat by more than 7 million votes was actually a mirage, the result of an array of forces had plotted the steal the election from him. A series of scathing court rulings rejected those claims, as did experts on voting technology.

As of Saturday, Dominion Voting Machines had not heard back from Powell or her legal team regarding their demand that she retract her accusations against the company, a Dominion spokesperson confirmed ABC News.

""The request to retract presents Ms. Powell with a simple choice. Retract her false and defamatory claims about the company and its voting systems, or continue to leave herself open to additional legal action,"" the Dominion spokesperson told ABC News earlier week. ""This would mean going to court to settle the matter.""

Each is now a candidate in Georgia’s high-stakes January 5 runoff election, the outcome of which could change control of the Senate next year.

Warren’s proposed ban is part of a broader anti-corruption plan she promoted on the presidential campaign trail and is reintroducing with hopes that it can gain traction now that she has returned to the Senate.

SACO, Maine (AP) — The coronavirus pandemic has been a struggle for much of American seafood, but at least one sector of the industry has found a way to grow during the crisis — the seaweed business.

Seaweed harvesting and farming, based largely along the rocky and chilly coast of Maine, has grown for several years as interest in foods and nutritional products made with the gooey marine algae have risen in popularity. Like many pieces of the seafood industry, seaweed is highly dependent on the restaurant sector, which made the pandemic a potentially major setback.

But that hasn’t been the case, according to state records and members of the industry. Representatives for Atlantic Sea Farms, a Saco company that works with two dozen seaweed farmers and accounts for most of the seaweed aquaculture in the state, said it nearly doubled its harvest this year to 450,000 pounds.

Other growers said they continued harvesting seaweed through the pandemic, though finding workers and buyers was more complicated than a typical year. The industry was able to pivot to selling more of its products via retail locations than restaurants, and that meant it avoided the trouble that befell other seafood industries, such as the hard-hit oyster business, said Tollef Olson, president of the Maine Seaweed Council.

“Almost all the products we put out have been stabilized,” Olson said. “Some of the wholesale business definitely dropped off, but we’re seeing more shelf space, and more online platforms.”

The statewide harvest of farm-raised seaweed in Maine grew from about 50,000 pounds in 2018 to about 275,000 pounds last year, state records show. Atlantic Sea Farms alone thinks its farmers will harvest more than 800,000 pounds in 2021.

The seaweed is processed into products such as seaweed sauerkraut and frozen kelp cubes for smoothies. The state’s seaweed industry also includes a wild harvest of rockweed, which is used for livestock feed and fertilizers.

The pandemic hit Maine right around the same time as the seaweed aquaculture business’s spring harvesting season, said Bri Warner, chief executive officer of Atlantic Sea Farms. Members of the industry have had to hustle to get seaweed products in new stores due to restaurant closures, and have had some success, she said.

“Four ounces of a kelp in smoothie cubes is not the same as kelp on every salad in Sweetgreen that’s going out the door. We’re being very creative about how we sell,” Warner said. “We feel very good about being able to weather the storm.”

The seaweed business’s ability to grow during the pandemic is an outlier within the U.S. seafood business. Consumer demand for seafood at restaurants dropped by more than 70% during the early months of the pandemic, and that sent troubling economic ripples through the business, according to one study published in the scientific journal Fish and Fisheries in November.

The seaweed industry has been limited by restrictions on the amount of people who can work on farms, said Sarah Redmond, one of the owners of Springtide Seaweed, a Gouldsboro grower. Growers often grow the seaweed underwater on ropes in bays, and the work is labor intensive.

However, the growth in people cooking at home, and looking to experiment with new ingredients, during the pandemic might have helped the seaweed trade, Redmond said.

“We’ve actually seen an increase in demand for our seaweed products,” she said. “There’s still a demand for healthy food and healthy ingredients.”"

PARIS (AP) — A modeling agent associated with disgraced U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein has been charged in France with sexual harassment and the rape of minors over 15 years old.

Jean-Luc Brunel was arrested as part of an ongoing investigation on Wednesday at Charles de Gaulle airport as he was preparing to take a flight to Senegal.

The Paris prosecutor announced in a statement Saturday that the charges were handed out Friday by a magistrate at the end of Brunel’s custody period. It said Brunel was not handed any human trafficking charges, which was one of the main lines of inquiry. The magistrate decided that there was not currently enough evidence to rule on that count, but he was not acquitted and could be charged in the future if anything new emerges. Brunel was remanded in custody.

Brunel is being investigated as part of a broad French probe into alleged sexual exploitation of women and girls by Epstein and his circle. Multiple women have identified themselves as victims and spoken to police since the French probe was opened in August last year, the same month in which Epstein committed suicide in jail.

A former model who testified to French police that she was drugged and raped as a teenager by Brunel said she wept tears of joy at the news of his detention."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is considering pushing to have a special counsel appointed to advance a federal tax investigation into the son of President-elect Joe Biden, setting up a potential showdown with incoming acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen.

Trump — angry that out-going Attorney General William Barr didn’t publicly announce the ongoing, two-year investigation into Hunter Biden — has consulted on the matter with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and outside allies.

That’s according to several Trump administration officials and Republicans close to the White House who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss private matters.

Beyond appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the younger Biden, the sources said Trump is interested in having another special counsel appointed to look into his own baseless claims of election fraud. But if he’s expecting his newly named acting attorney general to go further than Barr on either matter, he could end up quickly disappointed.

Barr on Monday evening announced he will resign effective next week , revealing his plans about a week after Hunter Biden publicly disclosed that he was under investigation related to his finances. It is generally Justice Department policy not to disclose investigations that are in progress, though the subjects of those investigations can.

Rosen, the deputy attorney general, will step into the Justice Department’s top job in an acting role. A longtime litigator, he has served as Barr’s top deputy since May 2019 but largely shies away from the spotlight. He said in a statement Tuesday he was “honored” to serve and “will continue to focus on the implementation of the Department’s key priorities.”

Trump is still weighing his options, considering whether to pressure Rosen to make the special counsel appointment or, if needed, to replace the acting attorney general with someone more likely to carry out his wishes. He has even asked his team of lawyers, including personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, to look into whether the president has the power to appoint a special counsel himself.

A key question will be whether Rosen can stand up to presidential pressure — and potentially withering attacks — in the waning weeks of the Trump administration. If not, Rosen could be cast aside in favor of others more willing to do Trump’s bidding.

Believing that a special counsel probe could wound a Biden administration before it even begins, Trump aides have urged the president to push for one, which would make it so the investigation can’t be easily stopped by the incoming president. No firm decision has been made.

Trump announced that Barr would be stepping down from his position on Dec. 23, amid lingering tension between the president and the attorney general over the Hunter Biden investigation. Trump was angry for days after learning that Barr knew of the Hunter Biden tax investigation before the election but did not disclose it.

He also was unhappy that Barr said in a widely reported interview with the AP that the Justice Department had not uncovered widespread election fraud that would have affected the results of the election.

For much of his tenure, Barr was perceived as one of the president’s most loyal Cabinet members, especially after he framed the results of Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation in a manner favorable to Trump even though the special counsel did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. It was Barr who first appointed a U.S. attorney to review the case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then sought to dismiss the criminal charges against Flynn, who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

As Barr exits, the biggest thing by far hanging over the Trump Justice Department is its investigation into Hunter Biden, which involves multiple U.S. attorney offices and FBI field offices. Appointing a special counsel could prove to be complicated, requiring consolidating different investigatory angles and bringing in someone new to run the probe and get up to speed.

Full Coverage: Politics

Under federal regulations, a special counsel can be fired only by the attorney general and for specific reasons such as misconduct, dereliction of duty or conflict of interest -- reasons that must be spelled out in writing. Appointing a special counsel for the Hunter Biden probe would also signal a more prolonged and complicated investigation than the current inquiry, so far largely centered on his taxes. A subpoena seeking documents from the younger Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma.

Either way, the probe is complicating Joe Biden’s pick for attorney general, upon whose shoulders this probe would land. Any nominee for attorney general is likely to face a mountain of questions at a confirmation hearing about how they would oversee the probe.

It could be that Rosen is left in the position for a few weeks after Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. If Trump doesn’t fire him, that is.

Rosen has been the public face of some of the Justice Department’s biggest actions, including its antitrust case against Google and the criminal case against opioid maker Purdue Pharma. Before joining the Justice Department, he worked at the Department of Transportation as general counsel and then deputy secretary.

At Rosen’s confirmation hearing in 2019, he suggested that he was willing to rebuff political pressure from the White House, if necessary. He told legislators that criminal investigations should “proceed on the facts and the law” and that prosecutions should be “free of improper political influences.”

“If the appropriate answer is to say no to somebody, then I will say no,” he said at the time."
"EXCLUSIVE: Jared Kushner helped create a Trump campaign shell company that secretly paid the president's family members and spent $617 million in reelection cash, a source tells Insider",770,kfpwct,https://www.businessinsider.com/jared-kushner-trump-campaign-shell-company-family-ammc-lara-2020-12,50,1608342561.0,,"Jared Kushner approved the creation of a shell company that spent almost half of the Trump campaign's $1.26 billion war chest, a person familiar with the operation told Insider exclusively.

American Made Media Consultants became the source of consternation for President Donald Trump's campaign staff, who were kept in the dark about its operations.

Despite its $617 million spending through AMMC, the Trump campaign publicly disclosed little information about the company, including how it used the money.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump's most powerful advisor, Jared Kushner, approved the creation of a campaign shell company that secretly paid the president's family members and spent almost half of the campaign's $1.26 billion war chest, a person familiar with the operation told Insider.

The operation acted almost like a campaign within a campaign. It paid some of Trump's top advisors and family members, while shielding financial and operational details from public scrutiny.

When Kushner and others created the company in April 2018, they picked Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump to become its president, Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence as its vice president, and Trump campaign Chief Financial Officer Sean Dollman as its treasurer and secretary, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations about the shell company.

Insider independently verified details of this person's account with other people close to the Trump campaign.

The shell company — incorporated as American Made Media Consultants Corp. and American Made Media Consultants LLC — allowed Trump's campaign to skirt federally mandated disclosures. The tactic could attract scrutiny from federal election regulators.

Campaign-finance records showed Trump's reelection effort and its affiliated committee with the Republican National Committee spent more than $600 million through American Made Media Consultants since its formation.

For months, some of Trump's top advisors and campaign staff told Insider they had no idea how the shell company functioned, which cast an air of mystery around the operation.

Trump's campaign leaders even launched an internal audit of the shell company and operations that were conducted under former campaign manager Brad Parscale but never reported the results of that review.

Some of those same advisors said they didn't learn about John Pence's and Lara Trump's involvement until Insider contacted them for this story.

But the mystery hid in plain sight: Kushner, Lara Trump, John Pence, and Dollman were often just feet away in the Trump campaign's headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, a Washington suburb.

""They like to say they don't know, but that's not true,"" the person familiar with AMMC said. ""What they wanted was excuses so they could blame other people. If they thought that, why did they keep using it?""

Trump campaign spent $617 million through AMMC

From January 2019 through the middle of November, the Trump campaign and an affiliated political committee together spent $617 million through American Made Media Consultants.

It was almost half of everything they spent in the failed effort to reelect Trump, according to an Insider review of Federal Election Commission records and analysis provided by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Some Trump advisors have long accused Parscale of trying to hide money from the now outgoing president, occasionally citing AMMC as an example of his obfuscation.

But the campaign spent the bulk of the money at AMMC — $415 million — after Trump fired Parscale as his campaign manager on July 15.

A spokesman for Kushner did not return a request for comment from Insider. Dollman would not provide comment when Insider reached him by phone.

""Lara Trump and John Pence resigned from the AMMC board in October 2019 to focus solely on their campaign activities, however, there was never any ethical or legal reason why they could not serve on the board in the first place. John and Lara were not compensated by AMMC for their service as board members,"" Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh told Insider on Friday.

Parscale declined to comment when reached by Insider on Friday.

Campaign-law experts have long accused the Trump team of using a corporate pass-through to hide payments.

The nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, led by former Republican Federal Election Commission Chairman Trevor Potter, filed a civil complaint with the FEC in July accusing the Trump campaign of ""disguising"" about $170 million worth of campaign spending in large part ""by laundering the funds"" through AMMC.

Brendan Fischer, the Campaign Legal Center's director of federal reform, said the payments to AMMC were a ""scheme to evade telling voters even the basics on where its money is really going"" and a ""shield to disguise the ultimate recipients of its spending.""

As a civil-law enforcer, the FEC can issue fines to political committees it determines have broken election laws.

If the federal government suspects a ""knowing and willful"" violation of election law has occurred, the Department of Justice has the power to open a criminal investigation into a political actor.

While such investigations are relatively uncommon, several former Justice Department and FEC officials previously told Insider that Justice Department officials may already be discreetly investigating Trump's reelection activity.

Some of Trump's campaign leaders even seemed stumped by the AMMC arrangement. Generally, they knew that AMMC was being used to buy pro-Trump TV, radio, and digital advertising and pay for other media.

But they couldn't discern precisely how much each AMMC vendor was keeping for itself.

The person familiar with AMMC said the rates its vendors charged the Trump campaign were often cheaper than what an outside political firm would have demanded. Using the shell company also allowed Parscale to keep Lara Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle — the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr. — on his payroll, the person familiar said.

The revelations come as Trump's top current and former advisors are trading blame for the president's loss to President-elect Joe Biden after a wild — and historically expensive — election cycle.

Supporters of the current campaign team, led by campaign manager Bill Stepien, said Parscale's lavish spending forced them to cut budgets during the final weeks leading up to Election Day, just when Trump needed money most.

Allies of the Parscale campaign team said the reelection operation was flush with cash, buoyed by millions of small-dollar donations from hardcore Trump supporters. They said if Stepien had kept up that pace of spending, Trump would have defeated Biden.

The Trump campaign ultimately ran a net $7 million surplus, campaign-finance records showed: As of late November, it reported $18.4 million cash on hand versus $11.3 million in debt.

One Republican close to the White House suggested Stepien and his team may have kept themselves in the dark on purpose, so as not to get on Kushner's bad side.

But a former advisor to Trump's 2016 campaign said it was also possible that Kushner simply withheld information from Stepien's new campaign team.

""Nothing was done without Jared's approval,"" the former Trump campaign advisor said. ""What Stepien doesn't know is because Jared doesn't want him to know.""

Parscale's strategies

American Made Media Consultants was born out of a different scandal: rampant accusations that Parscale had been enriching himself off Trump's reelection bid.

In February 2018, Trump and Kushner elevated Parscale, the digital-communication mastermind of Trump's 2016 election victory, to campaign manager.

One month later, a small team of campaign staff met with Trump's coterie of lawyers at the Jones Day law firm, the person familiar with the founding of AMMC said. The Jones Day lawyers, some of whom had worked on Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, said they had an idea for Parscale.

Romney had relied on a pass-through company, American Rambler, to make the most expensive purchases of his campaign: TV ads.

Ben Ginsberg — a Republican superlawyer who recently retired from Jones Day, the Trump campaign's preferred law firm — suggested Parscale and his team try the same. One month later, Kushner signed off on a plan to have Trump's family and campaign staff run the shell company, the person familiar with AMMC's operations said. American Made Media Consultants was formally incorporated on April 18, 2018, according to Delaware incorporation records.

In an email Thursday, Ginsberg declined to comment. ""Can't help you with this,"" he said. In recent weeks, Ginsberg has sharply criticized Trump.

Delaware has long been one of the best places in the US to hide corporate arrangements.

But that could change, as Congress earlier this month passed a corporate-transparency measure directed at combating financial crimes, both domestic and foreign.

The measure is part of the veto-proof National Defense Authorization Act and would require anonymous shell companies — including limited liability companies such as American Made Media Consultants — to disclose their real owners to the US Treasury Department.

On the afternoon of January 20, the Treasury Department will fall under Biden's control."
Acting Pentagon chief halts Biden transition briefings,62,kfnldb,https://www.axios.com/pentagon-biden-transition-briefings-123a9658-4af1-4632-a6e6-770117784d60.html?utm_campaign=organic&utm_medium=socialshare&utm_source=twitter,8,1608335438.0,,"Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller ordered a Pentagon-wide halt to cooperation with the transition of President-elect Biden, shocking officials across the Defense Department, senior administration officials tell Axios.

The latest: Biden transition director Yohannes Abraham contradicted the Pentagon's official response to this story on Friday afternoon, telling reporters, ""Let me be clear: there was no mutually agreed upon holiday break.""

""In fact, we think it’s important that briefings and other engagements continue during this period as there’s no time to spare, and that’s particularly true in the aftermath of ascertainment delay,"" Abraham continued, referring to the Trump administration's delay in recognizing Biden as president-elect.

Miller had said in a statement following the publication of this story: ""At no time has the Department cancelled or declined any interview. ... After the mutually-agreed upon holiday, which begins tomorrow, we will continue with the transition and rescheduled meetings from today.""

Behind the scenes: Trump administration officials left open the possibility cooperation would resume after a holiday pause. The officials were unsure what prompted Miller's action, or whether President Trump approved.

Why it matters: Miller's move, which stunned officials throughout the Pentagon, was the biggest eruption yet of animus and mistrust toward the Biden team from the top level of the Trump administration.

Fury at the Biden team among senior Pentagon officials escalated after the Washington Post published a story on Wednesday night revealing how much money would be saved if Biden halted construction of Trump's border wall.

Trump officials blame the leak on the Biden transition team (Though, it should be noted, they have no evidence of this, and both reporters on the byline cover the Trump administration and have historically been prolific beneficiaries of leaks.)

What happened: Meetings between President Trump's team and the Biden team are going on throughout the government, after a delayed start as the administration dragged its feet on officially recognizing Biden as president-elect.

Then on Thursday night, Miller — who was appointed Nov. 9, when Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper right after the election — ordered officials throughout the building to cancel scheduled transition meetings.

A senior Defense Department official sought to downplay the move, calling it ""a simple delay of the last few scheduled meetings until after the new year.""

PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday blamed his COVID-19 on a combination of negligence and bad luck, urging his compatriots to stay safe as critics called out slip-ups in his behavior to prevent infection, from a close-quarters handshake to repeated big-group meals over the past week.

In what looked like a self-shot video from the presidential retreat in Versailles where he was isolating, Macron said he was experiencing symptoms that included headaches, fatigue and a dry cough. He promised to give daily updates and be “totally transparent” about the evolution of his illness.

“I am doing well,” the 42-year-old French leader said, speaking softly with a bottle of gel on the desk behind him and dressed casually in a turtleneck top. “Normally, there is no reason for it to evolve in a bad way.”

Macron said his infection “shows that the virus really can touch everyone, because I am very protected and am very careful.”

“Despite everything I caught this virus — perhaps, doubtless, a moment of negligence, a moment of bad luck, too,” he said.

A fellow European leader who spent time with Macron at an EU summit last week, Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic, tested positive for the virus Friday. Ten other leaders at the EU summit have since tested negative; others either aren’t getting tested or haven’t released results.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who tested positive for the coronavirus and spent three days at Walter Reed Medical Center in early October, spoke with Macron on Thursday and wished him a speedy recovery, the White House said Friday. Several White House aides and members of Trump’s campaign staff tested positive after he did.

In France, Macron’s diagnosis brought criticism that he had set a bad example as the country sees a new uptick in cases and doctors warn families to take precautions this holiday season — especially at the dinner table.

Macron usually wears a mask and adheres to social distancing rules, and has insisted that his virus strategy is driven by science. But he has been captured on camera in recent days violating France’s virus-control guidelines.

He shook hands and half-embraced the head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Angel Gurria, at a meeting Monday. Both were masked, but Macron’s office acknowledged Friday the move was a “mistake.”

In his video message Friday, the president suggested that his behavior had helped limit the spread of the virus.

“Had I not respected the rules, the barrier measures, I would have caught it much faster and, most of all, I would have transmitted it in the preceding hours to many more people,” Macron said.

He urged people to “hold firm” and look after each other during the festive season, warning: “The virus is picking up, even stronger.”

Last week, Macron spent two days in intense negotiations at the EU summit in Brussels with the leaders of the other 26 member countries. Video excerpts released by the EU showed the leaders spread out in a circle in a huge meeting room — Macron, and most of the other leaders, were not masked.

Macron also hosted or took part in multiple large-group meals in the days before testing positive Thursday, including with members of his centrist party and rival politicians, while French people are currently advised to avoid gatherings larger than six people. His office has been contacting those present for the meals, but told some people sitting far from the president that they were not considered at risk.

Macron office isn’t providing details of his treatment. He is staying at the presidential residence of La Lanterne in the former royal city of Versailles, tucked in a grove tightly guarded by police.

Macron’s positive test comes as French health authorities are again seeing a rise in infections and are warning of more as French families prepare to get together for Christmas and New Year festivities. France reported another 18,254 new infections Thursday and its death toll is just under 60,000.

France’s Pasteur Institute released a study Friday suggesting that meal times at home and in public are a major source of contamination. Pasteur epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet said on France-Inter radio Friday that during the holidays, “we can see each other, simply not be too numerous, and at critical moments at meals, not too many people at the same table.”

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

Macron took a test “as soon as the first symptoms appeared” on Thursday morning and will self-isolate for seven days, in line with national health authorities’ recommendations, the presidency said. Macron plans to continue working, and went ahead with a planned speech by videoconference Thursday.

The French health minister suggested that Macron might have been infected at the EU summit in Brussels last week, but Macron had multiple meetings in Paris as well.

France had Europe’s first virus case in January, but Macron’s government came under criticism for not having enough masks or tests and not confining the population quickly enough. A strict two-month lockdown brought infections down, and France sent children back to school and their parents back to work.

But infections surged again this fall so he declared a new, softer lockdown in October aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals. The measures were relaxed slightly this week, though restaurants, tourist sites, gyms and some other facilities remain closed.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose again last week to 885,000, the highest weekly total since September, as a resurgence of coronavirus cases threatens the economy’s recovery from its springtime collapse.

The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of applications increased from 862,000 the previous week. It showed that nine months after the virus paralyzed the economy, many employers are still slashing jobs as the pandemic forces more business restrictions and leads many consumers to stay home. The number of claims was much higher than the 800,000 that economists had expected.

Before the coronavirus erupted in March, weekly jobless claims had typically numbered only about 225,000. The far-higher current pace reflects an employment market under stress and diminished job security for many.

The total number of people who are receiving traditional state unemployment benefits fell to 5.5 million from 5.8 million. That figure is down sharply from its peak of nearly 23 million in May. It means that some jobless Americans are finding jobs and no longer receiving aid. But it also indicates that many of the unemployed have used up their state benefits, which typically expire after six months.

With layoffs still elevated and new confirmed viral cases in the United States now exceeding 200,000 a day on average, the economy’s modest recovery is increasingly in danger. States and cities are issuing mask mandates, limiting the size of gatherings, restricting restaurant dining, closing gyms or reducing the hours and capacity of bars, stores and other businesses.

“U.S. weekly jobless claims continue to head in the wrong direction,″ Edward Moya, an analyst at the currency trading firm OANDA, wrote in a research note. “The labor market outlook is bleak as the winter wave of the virus is going to lead to more shutdowns.″

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve signaled that it expects the economy to rebound at a healthy pace next year as viral vaccines become widely distributed. But Chair Jerome Powell warned that the next three to six months will likely be painful for the unemployed and small businesses as pandemic cases spike. The Fed made clear that it’s prepared to keep interest rates ultra-low for the long run to help the economy withstand those threats.

Many jobless Americans are now collecting checks under two federal programs that were created this year to ease the economic pain inflicted by the pandemic. But those programs are set to expire the day after Christmas. Unless Congress acts to extend that aid, benefits will end completely for an estimated 9.1 million unemployed people. In a report Wednesday, the JPMorgan Chase Institute warned that a cutoff in benefits would likely cause the families of the unemployed to slash spending and to fall behind on mortgage payments.

Some federal aid appears likely to arrive soon. On Wednesday, congressional negotiators closed in on a $900 billion COVID-19 economic relief package that would deliver additional help to businesses, $300 per week jobless checks and $600 stimulus payments to most Americans. But there was no deal quite yet.

The number of jobless people who are collecting aid from one of the two federal extended-benefit programs — the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which offers coverage to gig workers and others who don’t qualify for traditional benefits — surged to 9.2 million from 8.6 million for the week that ended Nov. 28.

But the number of people receiving aid under the second program — the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which provides 13 weeks of federal benefits to people who have exhausted their state aid — also rose from 4.5 million to 4.8 million.

All told, 20.6 million people are now receiving some type of unemployment benefits. (Figures for the two pandemic-related programs aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations.)

The pandemic has been an economic as well as a health disaster. In March and April, employers slashed a dizzying 22 million jobs after the virus and the measures meant to contain it brought normal business activity to a halt. The nation’s gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — plummeted from April to June at a record annual rate of 31.4%.

The comeback started strong, boosted by a $2 trillion federal rescue package in March. But it has since lost momentum as confirmed COVID-19 cases have surged and Congress has thus far failed to enact further aid. Though GDP expanded at a record annual rate of 33.1% from July-September, the annual pace of growth is thought to be slowing significantly in the current quarter -- a slump that’s considered likely to extend into early next year.

The pace of job creation has diminished steadily — from 4.8 million added jobs in June to 1.8 million in July, 1.5 million in August, 711,000 in September, 610,000 in October and 245,000 in November.

On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales skidded 1.1% in November, the biggest drop in seven months and a troubling sign at the start of the all-important holiday shopping season.

Businesses appear to be retrenching as cases surge and the economy sputters. The data firm Womply reports that 23% of local businesses were closed Dec. 1, up steadily from 17% at the start of August. Womply also found that 41% of all local bars are closed along with 28% of restaurants and 32% of hair salons and other health and beauty shops.

According to the The Independent, the 78-year-old's speech was marred by persistent bouts of coughing and throat-clearing, as he attacked incumbent Donald Trump over his efforts to undermine his win.

“More than 81 million of the votes in the election were cast for me and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. That too is a record, more than any ticket has received in US history. It represented a winning margin of more than seven million votes over the number of votes cast for my opponent (Trump),"" said Biden.

During his speech, the Democrat, who is set to become the oldest US president in history, was forced to clear his throat several times, worrying netizens.

""Jeez! Somebody hand him a glass of water!"" American filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted.

""Watching Biden's speech from tonight. He looks absolutely terrible. He looks tired and sick, he's repeatedly coughing and having to clear his throat. He was also condescending, arrogant and divisive toward Conservatives,"" journalist Ryan Saavedra noted.

A tweep Billy Fllod joked:

""Mr president sir, I need you to take a lozenge and sip some water/gargle before your next speech okay? The constant throat clearing is not good public speaking.""

Daily Mail reported Biden insisted he was fighting a cold but several social media users urged him to take a Covid-19 test. According to the White House, the American politician took a coronavirus test on Friday, December 11 and the results were negative.

Earlier, the presidential electors had given the Democrat’s candidate 306 electoral votes compared to incumbent President Donald Trump’s 232.

California's 55 electoral votes were enough to help Joe surpass the 270 electoral vote threshold required.

Briefly.co.za previously reported that a man with the Twitter handle @Tenndurag showcased the piece his auntie sewed as he modelled in it, striking different poses. In a Twitter post on Saturday, December 12, the man captioned photos of the jacket as:

""Y'all look what my auntie made for me.""

The auntie made him a jacket and a cap that look very much like one a valet at a five-star hotel would wear. The blue and gold piece has a padded bottom with a blue braid at the back.

"White House security director has part of leg amputated after falling severely ill with COVID-19, fundraiser says",428,kel107,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-security-director-part-leg-amputated-falling/story?id=74757679&cid=clicksource_4380645_2_heads_hero_live_headlines_hed,78,1608190695.0,,"White House security director has part of leg amputated after falling severely ill with COVID-19, fundraiser says It is the most serious publicly reported case linked to the White House.

The director of the White House security office, Crede Bailey, was in an intensive care unit for three months and had part of his leg amputated after contracting COVID-19 several months ago, according to a fundraising campaign set up to help him.

Bailey, who recently moved to a full-time rehabilitation facility, now faces significant medical bills, according to the online fundraiser. He was hospitalized in September after falling ill with the coronavirus, people familiar with his condition told ABC News.

His illness came as dozens of White House staffers and allies of President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19 in a series of outbreaks tied to the White House. Among them were the president, first lady and their teenage son.

While a number of coronavirus cases were linked to a Sept. 26 White House celebration for then-Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, Bailey had been hospitalized before the event, according to the people familiar with his situation.

According to the fundraising page, Bailey suffered permanent injuries from his bout with COVID-19, including the amputations of his right foot, lower right leg, and big toe on his left foot.

In appealing for donations, the person listed as the campaign's organizer, Dawn McCrobie, wrote that Bailey would need to pay for a prosthetic leg, a wheelchair and modifications to his home, among other medical expenses. McCrobie said that ""even with insurance,"" the expenses were ""astronomical.""

McCrobie did not respond to requests for comment. Bailey and his relatives also did not respond to requests for comment.

The White House last week declined to comment to ABC News on his condition, but asked about him at a news conference on Tuesday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany for the first time publicly acknowledged his battle with the virus.

""Our heart goes out to his family,"" McEnany said. ""They have asked for privacy. And he is recovering, from what I understand. We are very pleased to see that. But he and his family will be in our prayers.""

Trump has not publicly commented about Bailey's situation. McEnany said she was ""not sure if the president's had a private conversation with him, nor would I confirm any private conversation that he did have.""

Bailey's experience with COVID-19 is the most serious publicly reported case linked to the White House.

Trump and several close allies were also hospitalized and received exceptional access to treatment or therapeutics. Among them were the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani; former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is also an ABC News contributor; and Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development.

Trump has for months minimized the severity of the virus and its impact on those it sickens. “Remember, when you catch it, you get better, and you’re immune,"" he said in an interview with Fox Business following his own recovery, which was aided by a world-class medical team and an experimental treatment that had, at the time, only been offered to a handful of people outside of clinical trials. In reality, COVID-19 has killed over 300,000 Americans.

Last week, a White House spokesman did not respond when asked whether Trump had donated, or considered donating, to Bailey. The official on Wednesday declined to comment.

The online fundraiser had raised over $30,000 by last week and more than doubled that total this week after a Monday article by Bloomberg News -- and the mention at McEnany's briefing -- brought more attention to Bailey's situation.

"‘We want them infected’: Trump appointee demanded ‘herd immunity’ strategy, emails reveal",102,keidf9,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408,7,1608182769.0,,"""[I]t may be that it will be best if we open up and flood the zone and let the kids and young folk get infected"" in order to get ""natural immunity…natural exposure,"" Alexander wrote on July 24 to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn, Caputo and eight other senior officials. Caputo subsequently asked Alexander to research the idea, according to emails obtained by the House Oversight Committee's select subcommittee on coronavirus.

Alexander also argued that colleges should stay open to allow Covid-19 infections to spread, lamenting in a July 27 email to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield that “we essentially took off the battlefield the most potent weapon we had...younger healthy people, children, teens, young people who we needed to fastly [sic] infect themselves, spread it around, develop immunity, and help stop the spread.”

Alexander was a top deputy of Caputo, who was personally installed by President Donald Trump in April to lead the health department's communications efforts. Officials told POLITICO that they believed that when Alexander made recommendations, he had the backing of the White House.

“It was understood that he spoke for Michael Caputo, who spoke for the White House,” said Kyle McGowan, a Trump appointee who was CDC chief of staff before leaving this summer. “That’s how they wanted it to be perceived.”

Senior Trump officials have repeatedly denied that herd immunity — a concept advocated by some conservatives as a tactic to control Covid-19 by deliberately exposing less vulnerable populations in hopes of re-opening the economy — was under consideration or shaped the White House's approach to the pandemic. “Herd immunity is not the strategy of the U.S. government with regard to coronavirus,"" HHS Secretary Alex Azar testified in a hearing before the House coronavirus subcommittee on Oct. 2.

In his emails, Alexander also spent months attacking government scientists and pushing to shape official statements to be more favorable to President Donald Trump.

For instance, Alexander acknowledges in a May 30 email that a draft statement from the CDC about how Covid-19 was disproportionately affecting minority populations was ""very accurate,"" but he warned HHS and CDC communications officials that ""in this election cycle that is the kind of statement coming from CDC that the media and Democrat [sic] antagonists will use against the president."" The problems were ""due to decades of democrat neglect,"" Alexander alleged.

Alexander also appeared to acknowledge that the White House's own push to let states wind down their Covid-19 restrictions was leading to a spike in cases.

""There is a rise in cases due to testing and also simultaneously due to the relaxing of restrictions, less social distancing,"" Alexander wrote in a July 24 email. ""We always knew as you relax and open up, cases will rise.""

The emails represent an unusual window on the internal deliberations of the Trump administration, and the tensions between political appointees like Alexander — a part-time professor at a Canadian university — and staff members in health agencies. On Sept. 16, HHS announced that Alexander would be leaving the department, just days after POLITICO first reported on his efforts to shape the CDC's famed Morbidity and Mortality and Weekly Reports and pressure government scientist Anthony Fauci from speaking about the risks of Covid-19 to children.

In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said that Alexander’s demands for herd immunity “absolutely did not” shape department strategy.

“Dr. Paul Alexander previously served as a temporary Senior Policy Advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs and is no longer employed at the Department,” the spokesperson said.

Alexander did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Caputo, who took medical leave the same day that Alexander left the department, has referred previous inquiries to HHS.

Public health experts have decried calls to deliberately infect younger, healthier Americans with Covid-19, saying that it would unnecessarily put millions of people at risk of long-term complications and even death. “We certainly are not wanting to wait back and just let people get infected so that you can develop herd immunity. That's certainly not my approach,” Fauci said in September.

Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), who chairs the coronavirus subcommittee, said in a statement that the documents ""show a pernicious pattern of political interference by Administration officials.""

""As the virus spread through the country, these officials callously wrote, 'who cares' and 'we want them infected,'"" Clyburn added. ""They privately admitted they ‘always knew’ the President’s policies would cause a ‘rise’ in cases, and they plotted to blame the spread of the virus on career scientists.""

Clyburn said that the documents — which the Trump administration only released to his subcommittee after the election, more than two months after his probe began — underscore why HHS must cooperate with his investigation and that CDC Director Redfield must appear for an interview about an email that he allegedly told staff to delete. Otherwise, ""I will be forced to start issuing subpoenas,"" Clyburn said.

The email cache provided a real-time look at the administration’s deliberations as the Covid-19 crisis first began to rebound during the summer.

""So the bottom line is if it is more infectiouness [sic] now, the issue is who cares?"" Alexander wrote in a July 3 email to the health department's top communications officials. ""If it is causing more cases in young, my word is who cares…as long as we make sensible decisions, and protect the elderely [sic] and nursing homes, we must go on with life….who cares if we test more and get more positive tests.""

""How can this be researched and proven true or false?"" Caputo asked Alexander in one July 25 email exchange, after Alexander had emailed Hahn and nine top communications officials across HHS and FDA about the value of herd immunity.

Alexander wrote back with data that he said he'd pulled from several studies, including a link to a June 30 Quanta Magazine article about the ""tricky math"" of herd immunity.

""I did not want to look like a nut ball and if as they think and as I think this may be true ... several hard hit areas may have hit heard [sic] at 20% like NYC,"" Alexander added. ""[T]hat's my argument….why not consider it?""

The health department has worked to distance itself from Alexander since his mid-September departure, and several Trump appointees said that Alexander was often isolated during his roughly six-month stint advising department officials.

“His rants had zero impact on policy and communications,” a senior administration official insisted. “Caputo enabled him to opine, but people pushed back and it even got to a point where Caputo told him to stop sending the emails.”

But McGowan, the former CDC chief of staff, said that Alexander was effective at delaying the famed Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports and watering down guidance that came from his agency.

“He absolutely put pressure on the CDC on different guidance documents, on MMWRs,” McGowan said. “He wanted to change MMWRs that were already posted, which is just outrageous.”

While McGowan said that even though agency officials fended off Alexander’s demands to edit the morbidity and mortality reports, “it’s the type of political meddling that delayed guidance, delayed MMWRs from getting them out as quickly as possible to be effective,” McGowan added."
Trump is already considering axing his new attorney general if he won't agree to a special counsel probe into Hunter Biden,158,kedhuj,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-discussing-firing-barrs-successor-as-attorney-general-report-2020-12,32,1608168344.0,,"Trump has discussed with top aides the prospect of replacing Jeffrey Rosen, who is set to replace Attorney General Bill Barr next week, reported the Associated Press.

The president is reportedly determined that Rosen appoint special counsels to investigate Hunter Biden's tax affairs and baseless election fraud allegations.

If Rosen does not comply, then Trump could force him out, according to the report.

Barr was previously considered one of Trump's staunchest loyalists, but their relationship soured.

It was reported last week that Barr had not revealed during the election that Hunter Biden was under investigation by authorities in Delaware.

President Donald Trump has already discussed firing Jeffrey Rosen, who is set to replace Attorney General Bill Barr next week, reported the Associated Press.

Trump is discussing removing Rosen if he does not comply with his demands and appoint a special counsel to probe Hunter Biden's tax affairs and the president's groundless election fraud claims, Trump administration and Republican sources close to the White House told the agency.

Trump has already talked through the move with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and attorney Pat Cipollone, according to the report.

Rosen is supposed to replace Barr, who announced his resignation Monday, as effectively a stopgap justice department chief until President-elect Joe Biden takes office in five weeks and appoints a successor.

According to the report, Trump has even discussed with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, whether he can appoint special counsel investigators himself, believing it would damage the incoming Biden administration.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. The White Hoiuse declined to comment.

Rosen has served as Barr's deputy at the justice department since 2019.

Barr was previously considered one of Trump's staunchest loyalists. Still, their relationship soured when the Wall St Journal revealed last week that Barr was aware that Hunter Biden was under investigation for potential tax fraud crimes by authorities in Delaware for months.

Trump was reportedly furious that Barr had not gone public with the information during the presidential election. One of Trump's main lines of attack against his rival was Hunter Biden's employment by Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, which he alleged was evidence of Biden family corruption.

No evidence has emerged to substantiate the allegations against Hunter Biden. However, as part of the US attorney's investigations into his tax affairs, he has been subpoenaed for information about his work with Burisma."
McConnell warns GOP off Electoral College brawl in Congress,257,kealsx,https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-senate-elections-elections-34fb478601b72b3e8049f12371670001,39,1608159226.0,,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., removes his face mask as he arrives for a news conference with other Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 15, 2020.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Fending off a messy fight that could damage Republicans ahead of Georgia Senate runoffs, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned fellow GOP senators not to join President Donald Trump’s extended assault on the Electoral College results .

In public remarks and private warnings on Tuesday, McConnell worked to push ahead to the Biden era and unite a fractured Republican Party ahead of the runoff elections that will determine Senate control.

First, the Republican leader heaped praise on Trump’s “endless” accomplishments as he congratulated President-elect Joe Biden during a morning Senate speech. Then he pivoted, privately warning Republican senators away from disputing the Electoral College tally when Congress convenes in a joint session Jan. 6 to confirm the results.

Such a dispute would yield a “terrible vote” for Republicans, McConnell told the senators, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss the call, which was first reported by Politico. They would have to choose whether to back Trump or publicly buck him.

Overnight, Trump mentioned McConnell in a tweet, saying it was “too soon” to give up. “Republican Party must finally learn to fight,” Trump wrote. He is making baseless claims of election fraud in a bid to subvert the election and remain in office.

Republicans worry that a prolonged fight over the electoral ballots could aggravate GOP divisions and hurt turnout in the Jan. 5 runoff election in Georgia, where two incumbent Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, face Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in a state that flipped in November for Biden.

McConnell has been a strong supporter of most Trump efforts. But on Tuesday he parted with the president, seeking to normalize relations with the coming Biden presidency while avoiding the spectacle of pitched floor fight that would divide the party as Trump reluctantly leaves office.

“I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate.

“Many of us had hoped the presidential election would yield a different result,” he said. “But our system of government has the processes to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20. The Electoral College has spoken.”

Biden told reporters he called to thank McConnell for the remarks and the two had a “good conversation.” He said he told McConnell there are “things we can work together on.”

McConnell’s words, after weeks of silence, followed other leading Republicans who spoke up the after the Electoral College voted late Monday. They finally said aloud what many Republicans had been signaling privately — that Biden won the election, and they are essentially abandoning Trump’s election attacks.

From there, the floodgates opened. Several GOP senators confirmed they had spoken with Biden, including Trump ally Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mitt Romney of Utah, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee. Some have had meetings with Biden’s nominees for administration posts.

In his phone call, Romney expressed admiration for Biden’s willingness to endure the rigors of a presidential campaign and serve in the nation’s highest office, the senator’s office said. The two also discussed the challenging political environment ahead.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said now that McConnell has spoken, “enough is enough” and Trump should “end his term with a modicum of grace and dignity.”

Some GOP lawmakers have vowed to carry the fight to Jan. 6 when Congress votes to accept or reject the Electoral College results. Others have said Trump’s legal battles should continue toward resolution by Inauguration Day, Jan. 20 .

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy declined to comment Tuesday when asked if he was ready to acknowledge Biden as the president-elect.

One House Republican, Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, is planning to challenge the Electoral College results when Congress convenes for the joint session.

At that time, any challenge in Congress would need to be raised by at least one member of the House and Senate. It’s unclear if any GOP senator will join in making the case.

McConnell and his lieutenants, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Roy Blunt of Missouri, warned the senators off any Electoral College challenge, according to one of the people familiar with Tuesday’s call. The GOP leaders further warned senators that forcing their colleagues into a vote on Electoral College challenges would prove difficult, especially for those facing their own reelections in 2022.

No Republican senator spoke up in contradiction.

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee is convening a hearing Wednesday on election fraud, has “no plans” to join with House Republicans and challenge the results, according to spokesman Austin Altenburg.

Historians and election officials have warned that Trump’s unfounded claims of voter fraud threaten to erode Americans’ faith in the election system.

Trump is trying to throw out the ballots of thousands of Americans, particularly those who voted by mail, in dozens of lawsuits that have mostly failed. His legal team is claiming irregularities, even though Attorney General William Barr, who abruptly resigned Monday, has said there is no evidence of widespread fraud that would alter the election results. State election officials, including Republicans, have said the election was fair and valid.

In a decisive blow to Trump’s legal efforts, the Supreme Court last week declined to take up two of his cases challenging the election process in key states. Some 120 House Republicans signed on to that failed effort.

LONDON (AP) — No need to take it to the max.

That’s the new Christmas message that leaders of the U.K.’s four nations were spreading Wednesday, after toughening up their advice over what people should do during the holiday period.

Last month, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland agreed to permit a maximum of three households to mix between Dec. 23 and Dec. 27, regardless of what local restrictions are in place.

But following a sharp spike in new infections — another 25,161 were recorded Wednesday, the highest since Nov. 14 — families are being urged to consider the rules as the outer limits of what they can do.

“Have yourselves a merry little Christmas and, I’m afraid, this year I do mean little,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a press briefing. “I want to stress these are maximums, not targets.”

His comments echoed those of other leaders elsewhere, though Wales said it will legislate to limit bubbles to two households.

Johnson said it would be “inhuman” to ban Christmas but that in light of the “worrying” rises in new infections in some parts of the country, people should think hard about what to do. He said anyone planning to meet others during the easing should start limiting contacts from this Friday, for example.

Professor Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical officer, said the advice was akin to driving at the speed limit in icy conditions.

“Just because you can doesn’t mean you should,” he said.

Concerns over the planned easing have ratcheted higher in recent days. With new infections rising in many places, many fear that the relaxation will only lead to more deaths. On Wednesday, the U.K. recorded another 612 COVID-related fatalities, taking the total to 65,520 — Europe’s second-highest behind Italy.

The confusion surrounding the scheduled easing has been exacerbated by the fact that many parts of the country have seen restrictions tightened this week. On Wednesday, London and nearby areas entered the highest level of local restrictions in England — Tier 3 — in which pubs and restaurants had to close again apart from takeout, and more curbs were placed on different households meeting up.

Johnson also said the elderly and the most vulnerable should be vaccinated by the early part of 2021. The U.K. is rolling out the vaccine developed by America’s Pfizer and the German company BioNTech after becoming on Dec. 8 the first country in the world to authorize it.

Other vaccines, from American biotechnology firm Moderna and one developed by the University of Oxford and British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, are currently being assessed by British regulators.

Britain’s new vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said Wednesday that 137,897 people had received a shot since inoculations began. They must all return in three weeks for a follow-up shot.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic

The government, which is providing the vaccine free of charge mainly at hospitals so far, is first targeting nursing home workers and people over 80. Nursing home residents are now being vaccinated as well after issues relating to the transportation of the vaccine, which needs to be kept at super-cold temperatures, were addressed.

Despite the update, questions remain over how many people can be inoculated on any given day, and what proportion of people being offered the vaccine are agreeing to get a shot.

To date, 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine are known to be in the U.K. and 5 million more are expected to arrive this year, half the original expectation.

“With the vaccine, and all the other measures we are taking, we do know that things will be better in this country by Easter,” Johnson said. “And, I’m sure that next year Christmas will be as normal as usual for every family in the country.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A subpoena seeking documents from Hunter Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma, according to a person familiar with a Justice Department tax investigation of President-elect Joe Biden’s son.

The breadth of the subpoena, issued Tuesday, underscores the wide-angle lens prosecutors are taking as they examine the younger Biden’s finances and international business ventures.

Hunter Biden’s ties to Burisma in particular have long dogged the policy work and political aspirations of his father, Joe Biden, now the president-elect of the United States. It’s unclear whether Hunter Biden’s work at the Ukrainian company is a central part of the federal investigation or whether prosecutors are simply seeking information about all his sources of income in recent years.

The person was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

A lawyer for the younger Biden, George Mesires, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment for this story and a spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment.

Hunter Biden confirmed Wednesday that his taxes are under federal investigation. The revelation comes at a delicate time for the president-elect, who is building out his Cabinet and will soon decide on his nominee to run the Justice Department, the same department overseeing the investigation into his son.

In addition to the Burisma-related request, the subpoena issued last week also seeks information on Hunter Biden’s Chinese business dealings and other financial transactions.

The probe was launched in 2018, the year before his father announced his candidacy for president. At one point in the investigation, federal prosecutors were also examining potential money laundering offenses, two people familiar with the matter told the AP.

Hunter Biden said he only learned of the investigation on Tuesday.

The younger Biden joined the board of Burisma in 2014, around the time his father, then vice president, was helping conduct the Obama administration’s foreign policy with Ukraine. President Donald Trump and his allies have long argued, without evidence, that Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine influenced the Obama administration’s policies toward the Eastern European nation.

Senate Republicans said in a report earlier this year that the appointment may have posed a conflict of interest but did not provide evidence that any policies were directly affected by Hunter Biden’s work.

ADVERTISEMENT

The president-elect is not believed to be a focus of the investigation. He has not weighed in on the merits of the investigation, saying only to reporters on Friday that he was “proud of my son.”

For months, the U.S. attorney’s office in Pittsburgh has also been collecting information from Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and others as part of the Justice Department’s process to receive and analyze information related to Ukraine, including documents Giuliani wanted to present to prosecutors that he had been gathering in Ukraine about Joe and Hunter Biden.

In announcing that process in February , Barr cautioned that the department had to be careful about any information coming from Ukraine, saying: “There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, a lot of cross currents. And we can’t take anything we received from Ukraine at face value.”

The former New York City mayor was a main character when the House voted to impeach Trump. The impeachment inquiry centered on Trump’s dealings with Ukraine’s president and whether he abused his office by seeking the investigation into the Bidens. Giuliani pressured officials to do the investigations and has been pushing unsubstantiated corruption allegations against the Bidens.

Giuliani himself had also been under federal investigation, with federal prosecutors in Manhattan examining whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether that investigation remains active as Trump has discussed the possibility of preemptive pardons for some of his family members and close associates, including Giuliani."

TOKYO (AP) — Officials from Japan’s space agency said Tuesday they have found more than the anticipated amount of soil and gases inside a small capsule the country’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft brought back from a distant asteroid this month, a mission they praised as a milestone in planetary research.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said its staff initially spotted some black particles sitting on the bottom of the capsule’s sample catcher when they pulled out the container on Monday. By Tuesday, scientists found more of the soil and gas samples in a compartment that stored those from the first of Hayabusa’s two touchdowns on the asteroid last year.

“We have confirmed a good amount of sand apparently collected from the asteroid Ryugu, along with gases,” JAXA Hayabusa2 project manager Yuichi Tsuda said in a video message during an online news conference. “The samples from outside of our planet, which we have long dreamed of, are now in our hands.”

Tsuda called the successful return of the asteroid soil and gas samples “a major scientific milestone.”

The pan-shaped capsule, 40 centimeters (15 inches) in diameter, was dropped by Hayabusa2 from space to a predetermined spot in a sparsely populated Australian desert on Dec. 6 at the end of its six-year round trip to Ryugu, more than 300 million kilometers (190 million miles) from Earth.

The capsule arrived in Japan last Tuesday for research that scientists hope will provide insight into the origins of the solar system and life on Earth.

Hirotaka Sawada, a JAXA scientist, was the first to look inside the capsule’s sample-catcher. Sawada said he was “almost speechless” with joy when he found that the samples inside included some that were, as expected, dust size, but also some the size of pebbles.

Soil samples in photos shown in Tuesday’s presentation looked like heaps of dark coffee grounds mixed with granules.

Sawada said the tightly sealed capsule successfully brought back asteroid gases that are clearly different from the air on Earth — a first sample-return of gases from outer space. Kyushu University scientist Ryuji Okazaki said that gases could be related to minerals in asteroid soil and that he hopes to identify the gaseous samples and determine their age.

Scientists are hoping samples from the asteroid’s subsurface can provide information from billions of years ago that are unaffected by space radiation and other environmental factors. JAXA scientists say they are particularly interested in organic materials in the samples to learn about how they were distributed in the solar system and if they are related to life on Earth.

Full Coverage: Science

Sei-ichiro Watanabe, a Nagoya University earth and environment scientist working with JAXA, said having more sample material to work with than expected is great news as it will expand the scope of studies.

The samples were gathered from two touchdowns that Hayabusa2 made last year on Ryugu. The landings were more difficult than expected because of the asteroid’s extremely rocky surface.

The first landing collected samples from Ryugu’s surface and the second from underground. Each was stored separately. JAXA said it will look into another compartment, used for a second touchdown, next week, and will continue an initial examination ahead of the later studies of the material.

Following studies in Japan, some of the samples will be shared with NASA and other international space agencies for additional research beginning in 2022.

Hayabusa2, meanwhile, is now on an 11-year expedition to another asteroid to try to study possible defenses against meteorites that could fly toward Earth."
Trump uses Georgia Senate race to raise money for his own PAC,368,kdpvx9,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-senate-election-fund-donations-trump-save-america-political-action-committee/,12,1608081556.0,,"Washington — For Republicans fighting to maintain their hold on the Senate, the stakes for the party in Georgia could not be higher: ""The Georgia Runoff Election is right around the corner and the fate of the Nation hangs in the balance,"" proclaimed an email from President Trump's joint fundraising venture with the Republican National Committee.

""Securing these two critical Senate seats is absolutely paramount. We need YOU to make sure we have the resources to WIN BIG,"" a fundraising email signed by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and sent Tuesday pleads.

""President Trump and Vice President Pence are fighting because they know that this critical Senate Runoff Election is a choice between a Socialist Nightmare and the American Dream,"" another appeal from the Trump campaign sent Monday states. ""YOUR support will POWER our movement all the way to TWO stunning Republican Senate victories.""

But while the solicitations for the ""Georgia Election Fund"" purport to raise money to help GOP Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler win reelection, the fine print of the emails sent to Mr. Trump's supporters shows the majority of each donation will go to the president's own political action committee, Save America.

According to the allocation formula for donations detailed on the website linked to in the emails, 75% of each contribution, up to $5,000, will first go to Save America, then to the Trump campaign's ""Recount Account,"" up to $2,800. The remaining 25% of each donation will be directed to the Republican National Committee's operating account, with any money left over going to the party's legal proceedings or headquarters accounts.

The president launched Save America days after the November general election, and since Election Day, the fundraising apparatuses tied to Mr. Trump have collectively raked in more than $207.5 million in donations. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Georgia fundraising emails.

Like with emails that claim to support Republicans' efforts in Georgia, solicitations from the Trump campaign that sought donations to support the president's legal battles challenging the election results show most of each contribution went to his leadership PAC or to pay off his campaign's debts.

Perdue and Loeffler are competing against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively, in two runoff elections slated for January 5. With Republicans currently heading into the next Congress with 50 seats in the Senate, the pair of races will determine which party controls the upper chamber. If Ossoff and Warnock unseat their Republican opponents, the Senate will be split 50-50, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will cast tie-breaking votes.

Next month's runoff elections in Georgia have brought Mr. Trump and President-elect Joe Biden back to the campaign trail for the first time since the general election. The president appeared at a rally in Valdosta, Georgia, earlier this month to boost support for Perdue and Loeffler, while Mr. Biden is traveling to Atlanta on Tuesday to campaign for Ossoff and Warnock."
Democrats resigned to dropping local aid in COVID-19 bill,32,kdmnrb,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-local-governments-steven-mnuchin-bills-aafdd37e1e2bbd82a190594a38639f33,6,1608071233.0,,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Top Capitol Hill Republicans labored Tuesday to keep the price tag for a long-delayed COVID-19 aid package in check, seeking to prevail in a battle over help for state and local governments, while capping the cost of bonus jobless benefits and direct payments sought by Democrats.

Negotiations on COVID-19 relief intensified Tuesday after months of futility. The top four leaders of Congress met twice in hopes of finally cementing an agreement that would revive subsidies for businesses hit hard by the pandemic, help distribute new coronavirus vaccines, fund schools and renew soon-to-expire jobless benefits.

After two meetings in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Capitol suite, where Democrats pressed for more generous steps to help individuals struggling in the COVID-19 economy, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., gave an upbeat assessment.

“I think we’ve built a lot of trust,” McCarthy said. “I think we’re moving in the right direction. I think there’s a possibility of getting it done.”

The uptick in activity could be a sign that an agreement is near, though COVID-19 relief talks have been notoriously difficult.

“We’re making significant progress and I’m optimistic that we’re gonna be able to complete an understanding sometime soon,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Pressure for a deal is intense. Unemployment benefits run out Dec. 26 for more than 10 million people, many businesses are barely hanging on after nine months of the pandemic, and money is needed to distribute new vaccines that are finally offering hope for returning the country to normal.

McConnell is playing a strong hand in the lame-duck session and is pressuring Democrats to drop a much-sought $160 billion state and local government aid package. Several senior Democrats, including close allies of President-elect Joe Biden — who is eager for an agreement — have said they would go along now and fight for the aid next year.

McConnell says he’ll drop a demand for provisions shielding businesses from COVID-19-related lawsuits, a key priority, if Democrats agree to drop the $160 billion state and local aid package.

“We can live to fight another day on what we disagree on,” McConnell said Tuesday. “But we ought to go forward with what we can agree on.”

Pelosi has insisted for months that state and local aid would be in any final bill, but as time is running out, Democrats appear unwilling to hold the rest of the package hostage over the demand.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We’re not going home until this is done,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said on CNN Tuesday morning. “We’ve got to get people a lifeline.”

Manchin is an architect of a bipartisan $748 billion aid package that is aimed at serving as a template for the leadership talks. President Donald Trump’s chief negotiator, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, supports a package with many similar elements. There is also bipartisan support for transportation and transit assistance, funding for rural internet service and help for the Postal Service, among other provisions.

A Republican familiar with the talks said the biggest obstacles include money for state and local governments; how to handle direct payments favored by Trump and Democrats but opposed by many GOP conservatives; and the restoration of a bonus jobless benefit of $300 or so per week that would supplement regular state unemployment benefits. The Republican required anonymity because the talks are secret.

Lawmakers also worked to finalize a yearend catchall funding package that will be the basis for the last significant legislation of the Trump presidency.

There’s a hoped-for deadline of midnight Friday to deliver the completed package to Trump. That is when a partial government shutdown would arrive with the expiration of last week’s temporary funding bill. But there’s no guarantee that the massive yearend measure will be completed in time. If the talks drag, further temporary bills could be needed.

Negotiations on the $1.4 trillion catchall spending bill are “essentially finished,” said a congressional aide participating in the talks. While details are closely held, “the status quo is prevailing.” That means Trump would get another $1.4 billion or so for a final installment to continue construction of his long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Republicans have succeeded in killing a $12 billion plan to break last year’s budget mini-agreement by using accounting maneuvers to pad veterans health care funding to accommodate big cost increases from expanding access to health care services from private providers. Instead, a different set of moves is being employed to provide for equivalent spending increases for other domestic programs.

The post-election lame-duck session is the last chance to wrap up the unfinished work this year, a goal of all involved, though they have been slow until now to forge the often-tricky compromises required to pull the measure together.

A state and local aid package was part of the almost $2 trillion CARES Act that passed the Senate unanimously in March. The $150 billion aid package to states and large cities evoked little controversy then, but many Republicans are adamantly against the idea now, though any additional aid would also go to smaller municipalities left out of the prior round."
Fake electors try to deliver Arizona's 11 votes for Trump,370,kdjogg,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/12/14/electoral-college-arizona-group-tries-cast-fake-trump-votes/6546979002/,67,1608058588.0,,"In another sign of the lingering unrest over President Donald Trump's election loss, an Arizona group sent the National Archives in Washington, D.C., notarized documents last week intended to deliver, wrongly, the state's 11 electoral votes for him.

Copies of the documents obtained by The Arizona Republic show a group that claimed to represent the ""sovereign citizens of the Great State of Arizona"" submitted signed papers casting votes for what they want: a second term for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

Mesa resident Lori Osiecki, 62, helped created a facsimile of the ""certificate of ascertainment"" that is submitted to formally cast each state's electoral votes as part of an effort to prevent what she views as the fraudulent theft of the election.

""We seated before the legislators here. We already turned it in. We beat them to the game,"" she said.

IT'S OFFICIAL: Arizona's electors cast state's 11 votes for President-elect Joe Biden

Osiecki said she and others associated with a group called ""AZ Protect the Vote"" have attended the postelection rallies protesting the results, including the daylong meeting in Phoenix that included Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. She left that gathering upset that Gov. Doug Ducey wasn't supporting the president's efforts and she wanted to take further action. She and the others chose electors as a result.

""One thing I will say about conservatives, is if something is wrong, and we have lost — a true loss — then we accept,"" she said. ""We're not going to drag people through the mud and fight it. But this clearly has got issues. I saw it with my own eyes and my own research. After that hearing, I was shocked we didn't have any other marching orders.""

The 11 electors actually chosen by Arizona voters last month — meeting in an unpublicized location because of security concerns over their task — cast their votes Monday for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, formalizing the Democrats' victory nationally and in the state.

While Osiecki's elector documents do not appear to have been taken as genuine, they are part of a weekslong effort, led by Trump, his advisers, and involving Arizona Republican Party officials and three members of Arizona's GOP congressional delegation casting doubt on the legitimacy of Biden's victory in Arizona and nationally.

Reps. Andy Biggs and Debbie Lesko were among more than 100 Republican members of Congress to formally support a lawsuit brought by the attorney general of Texas seeking to overturn the results in four states where Biden won. The U.S. Supreme Court quickly dismissed the effort.

Rep. Paul Gosar has been a vocal supporter of the ""Stop the Steal"" effort seeking to similarly overturn the results based on baseless claims of widespread fraud. He also has encouraged people to sign on to an effort to recall Gov. Doug Ducey, who certified the election results showing Biden winning Arizona.

On Monday, White House adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News that alternate electors for selected states would be casting votes for Trump. Arizona was not named as among them, and there was no indication the fake electors were connected to that effort.

""As we speak today, an alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote, and we're going to send those results up to Congress,"" Miller said. ""This will ensure that all of our legal remedies remain open.""

Stephen Miller on Fox & Friends says ""an alternative"" group of electors is also voting today:



""As we speak, an alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote and we are going to send those results to Congress.""pic.twitter.com/5kIkfsbOFw — Travis Akers (@travisakers) December 14, 2020

Arizona's ersatz electors sent their choices using documents notarized by Melanie Hunsaker, who works in real estate. Her husband, Jamie Hunsaker, is a Trump enthusiast and one of the purported electors.

Donald Paul Schween, another would-be elector, has been active in Republican Party politics.

Federico Buck, another real estate veteran, is among the signatories. Others include Cynthia Franco, Sarai Franco, Stewart A. Hogue, Carrie Lundell, Christeen Taryn Moser, Danjee J. Moser, Jessica Panell and Peter Wang. Osiecki attested to the group's eligibility as electors.

It was not immediately clear if the group's effort broke any state or federal laws.

Arizona sketches out a series of criminal charges relating to voting and election fraud, but those mostly appear to mostly deal with casting regular ballots or tallying the ballots.

It also has a provision for making, possessing or presenting what are known as forged instruments with an intent to defraud. That is a felony offense.

The federal government has broad authority to prosecute what it deems mail fraud, although it is more often used to target financial crimes. There is a provision in the mail fraud statutes for depriving people of what are known as ""honest services.""

Osiecki said she wants the archivist in Washington to count her group's electoral choices. She thinks the nation's election integrity is riding on it.

""I've never been in politics before,"" she said. ""I'm not crazy. I'm just a person who feels like there's a problem here. We're at that (1776) moment here. It's the little people who are going to matter. You can't sit on the sidelines anymore.""

"Attorney General William Barr to depart administration, Trump announces",53,kd9801,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/attorney-general-william-barr-depart-administration-trump-announces-n1251189,17,1608016814.0,,"Attorney General William Barr will leave his position this month, President Donald Trump said in a tweet Monday.

The news comes not long after Barr said there was no widespread fraud in the election, defying Trump, who has made baseless claims the basis of a failed legal bid to overturn the results and stay in power.

""Just had a very nice meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House,"" Trump tweeted. ""Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family.""

Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics

Barr ""resigned on his own accord"" and ""wasn't pushed out or forced to resign,"" a White House official said. The official described Barr's afternoon meeting with Trump as ""very amicable.""

Trump named Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen as acting attorney general to serve in the remaining weeks of his term. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn in Jan. 20, has not announced his pick for attorney general.

Just had a very nice meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House. Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 14, 2020

Barr took over the role after Trump clashed with his previous attorney general, Jeff Sessions, over the Russia investigation, which Barr referred to as the ""nadir"" of his tenure in his resignation letter to Trump.

""I am greatly honored that you called on me to serve your Administration and the American people once again as Attorney General. I am proud to have played a role in the many successes and unprecedented achievements you have delivered for the American people,"" he said.

He later added, ""The nadir of this campaign was the effort to cripple, if not oust your administration with frenzied and baseless accusations of collusion with Russia.""

Barr, who also served as attorney general for President George H.W. Bush, is only the second person to have held the job twice. John Crittenden was the first, in the 19th century. Barr was confirmed by the Senate in 2019, 54-45.

Despite his reputed loyalty to Trump, Barr in recent months found himself in the president's crosshairs. Trump has praised and criticized Barr in interviews, and he has used the Justice Department as a cudgel to go after perceived political enemies.

Trump over the weekend lashed out on Twitter following media reports that Barr had instructed officials to prevent word of investigations into Hunter Biden from becoming public in the weeks leading up to the November election.

Why didn’t Bill Barr reveal the truth to the public, before the Election, about Hunter Biden. Joe was lying on the debate stage that nothing was wrong, or going on - Press confirmed. Big disadvantage for Republicans at the polls! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2020

In October, Trump said he was ""not happy"" with Barr after the Justice Department's investigation of the Obama administration found no wrongdoing and quietly concluded with no criminal charges, and he declined to say whether he would keep Barr on for a potential second term.

But Democrats have long accused Barr of acting as Trump's personal attorney rather than as an independent official. He has been lambasted for undercutting the conclusions of the Mueller investigation, directing federal prosecutors to abandon their prosecution of ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn and repeating Trump's baseless claims about mail-in voting."

Miller, appearing on Fox News as a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, brushed off the idea that the Electoral College vote marked any kind of end to the process.

""The only date in the Constitution is Jan. 20. So we have more than enough time to right the wrong of this fraudulent election result and certify Donald Trump as the winner of the election,"" Miller said on ""Fox & Friends.""

""As we speak, today, an alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote and we're going to send those results up to Congress,"" he continued. ""This will ensure that all of our legal remedies remain open. That means that if we win these cases in the courts, that we can direct that the alternate state of electors be certified.""

Electors from every state will meet on Monday to formally elect Biden as the next president. Those results will be certified by the states and submitted to Congress.

Miller indicated that Trump supporters will act as ""alternates"" in a handful of contested states, including Georgia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, to submit their own, unofficial results. Should the Trump campaign succeed in overturning the outcome in any of those states, Miller said, the alternate electors could then be recognized by Congress.

Nothing in the Constitution or state electoral processes allows for such an ""alternate"" slate of electors.

Miller also raised the idea of state legislatures stepping in to overturn the results or of Congress interceding.

Trump and his team have been overwhelmingly unsuccessful in challenging the election results. They have had dozens of legal cases dismissed for lack of standing or evidence, and Georgia has confirmed Biden as the winner after multiple recounts.

Still, Miller's comments are a clear sign that the president will not suddenly reverse course and accept defeat once the Electoral College has spoken.

Trump has for weeks spread false claims of widespread voter fraud that his attorneys have failed to back up in court, and he has undermined confidence in the election to the point that polls show a majority of Republicans do not believe Biden was legitimately elected."
Maduro wields powerful hate law against remaining foes in Venezuela,6,kd2pfl,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/venezuela-politics-hatelaw/,3,1607997701.0,,"SAN JOSÉ DE GUANIPA, Venezuela–Francisco Belisario, a Venezuelan mayor, retired general and member of the ruling Socialist party, had enough. His loudest local critic had accused him of bungling the response to the coronavirus outbreak and other big problems.

In August, he wrote a state prosecutor and requested an “exhaustive investigation” of his nemesis, Giovanni Urbaneja, a former lawmaker who had become a gadfly to the mayor and other Socialist officeholders. Urbaneja, Belisario wrote in a letter reviewed by Reuters, was conducting a “ferocious smear campaign” on Facebook and elsewhere.

Urbaneja not only defamed him and President Nicolás Maduro, the mayor wrote. He violated Venezuela’s Law Against Hate. The law, passed in 2017 but rarely used before this year, criminalizes actions that “incite hatred” against a person or group. Charge Urbaneja with hate crimes, the mayor implored the prosecutor.

Days later, several dozen masked officers raided Urbaneja’s home and took him at gunpoint for “a chat,” according to the police report of his arrest and Urbaneja’s wife. Urbaneja remains jailed, awaiting formal charges and a trial.

The mayor, in a text message to Reuters, confirmed writing the letter seeking hate-law charges against Urbaneja. He defended the move, saying his foe’s critique was unfair because the local coronavirus response is managed by the national health system, not the mayor’s office.

It was an increasingly common maneuver: In a review of more than 40 recent hate-law arrests, Reuters found that in each case, authorities intervened against Venezuelans who had criticized Maduro, other ruling party officials or their allies.

Despite its growing use by prosecutors, the hate law is considered unconstitutional and illegitimate by many Venezuelan legal scholars consulted by Reuters. Not only does the law violate the right to free expression, they argue, it was also illegally enacted – drafted and rubber-stamped by a parallel legislature that Maduro created at the time to circumvent the opposition-controlled assembly.

The law played an important role in a nationwide election this month, Maduro’s opponents say, by cowing critics who had spoken out about the government in the runup to the vote. The election, widely considered a sham by the opposition, human rights groups and most Western democracies, finally gave control of the assembly, the last part of the national government not aligned with Maduro, to his allies.

Maduro is wielding the force of the state in a widening range of ways to tighten his grip on power in the impoverished South American country, now in its eighth year of economic crisis. To suppress dissent in poor neighborhoods, his government deploys special police, some of whom are convicted criminals, to conduct lethal raids and intimidate citizens. To appease enfeebled security forces, police and troops are often allowed to loot, extort and commit violent crimes. Maduro himself has been indicted by the United States for narcoterrorism and other alleged crimes.

Now, with little effective opposition to challenge the hate legislation, and most of the courts controlled by judges also loyal to Maduro, the law could be an even more formidable tool against dissent. “A law like this, in the hands of a judicial power without independence, lends itself to all sorts of persecution,” said Alberto Arteaga, a criminal law specialist at the Central University of Venezuela. “The criminal justice system is being used as a weapon.”

Tarek Saab, the government’s chief prosecutor, is one of the architects of the hate law. In a brief telephone interview, he rejected claims that the act is being used for partisan purposes. He told Reuters that the legislation is an important instrument for defusing unrest.

“The voices of violence, terrorism and crime have been completely disarmed,” he said. Saab declined to discuss individual cases reviewed by Reuters.

Venezuela’s Information Ministry, responsible for communications with Maduro and other senior officials, didn’t respond to email and telephone requests for further comment. Spokespeople at the Justice Ministry didn’t respond to Reuters’ queries.

This account of the crackdowns on Urbaneja and others reviewed by Reuters is based on previously undisclosed court records and interviews with detainees, their families and their attorneys. Their cases show how the sweeping but little-understood law is being used with increasing success to jail or cow those still daring to speak out against Venezuela’s government. One hate detainee was a university professor who went on Facebook to blame the collapse of the oil industry on Maduro’s government. After his arrest, agents circulated a mug shot of the academic with his alleged weapon – a smartphone.

The arrests share similarities. Most targets have been authors of posts on social media, chat rooms and text-message services, many of them criticizing the government’s coronavirus response. In most of the 43 cases examined by Reuters, police or intelligence agents seized suspects on false premises, claiming they wanted to discuss unrelated issues. And lawyers, spouses and relatives of those arrested typically said they went days or weeks unable to contact detainees, with little or no documentation from police or prosecutors.

“It was anguish,” said Lesnee Martínez, Urbaneja’s wife, who waited two months before she was allowed to visit him in jail.

The crackdown is low-tech. Targets are identified not by tracking software or other technology, but by loyalists and government technicians who point out disagreeable social media posts or text messages to prosecutors. Still, the effort is quashing discussion online and in messaging platforms that until recently were safe venues for Maduro critics.

In addition to laws used widely to allege “conspiracy” and “disorder” by government opponents, the hate legislation is proving to be an effective weapon against critics, not least because of harsh penalties for those convicted. It provides for prison terms of up to 20 years, longer than the 18-year sentence for some murder convictions. But most cases don’t ever reach trial, Reuters found. Instead, defendants spend indefinite periods, often months, in pre-trial detention. They receive little information about their case from prosecutors and struggle to build a defense because lawyers are kept in the dark, too.

Releases appear arbitrary. In a move the government said was meant to “promote democratic debate,” Maduro in August pardoned over 100 people, many of them opposition activists charged with conspiracy, hate and other crimes. But the government at the time made clear that those freed could go right back to jail if they were deemed again to be committing an offense.

At least five of the 100-plus freed had been arrested under the hate law, Reuters determined. Three of the released hate suspects told Reuters that officials sought silence in exchange for their freedom.

Other suspects report similar treatment. Luis Araya, a physician in the central state of Lara, said police detained him last April after he changed his profile photo on WhatsApp, the messaging platform, to include a black ribbon and a comment, in jest, that he was “rehearsing” for Maduro’s death. A judge freed him the next day, but warned him against publishing “messages against Maduro.” His discharge document, reviewed by Reuters, orders him to check in monthly until his case goes to trial.

Court officials didn’t respond to Reuters requests to discuss Araya’s case.

The arbitrary nature of arrests and releases, government opponents say, makes the law especially useful in silencing opponents. “It has generated self-censorship,” said Marianela Balbi, director of Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, a press and free-speech advocacy group in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital. “The intention is clear: Don’t challenge public officials.”

“Bring order to this”

The law has its origins in deadly protests that rocked Venezuela in 2017.

That March, as Maduro sought to cement control amid a worsening economic meltdown, the Supreme Court, stacked with presidential appointees, ruled that the opposition-controlled National Assembly was “in contempt” of the government. The court said it would assume the role of the legislature.

Protests erupted across the country. Demonstrations continued through August, when Maduro created a new body, the Constituent Assembly, to supplant the old legislature. At least 125 people died in clashes between protestors and security forces.

“The voices of violence, terrorism and crime have been completely disarmed.”

That October, Maduro appeared on state television with a group of cabinet members. He asked them to find ways to curb criticism on social networks. Such posts, he said, fuelled the unrest. “Bring order to this,” Maduro ordered.

Ministers and other senior officials convened to address his demand. Among them was Saab, the chief prosecutor.

Saab had assumed the position weeks before when his predecessor, Luisa Ortega, broke with Maduro over the creation of the new assembly. A former public defender, Saab, 57 years old, is widely described by opponents as one of Maduro’s lead henchmen. He was one of 13 Maduro officials sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury that year for “the undermining of democracy” and waging “rampant violence” against protestors. Saab has called the sanctions “a badge of honor.”

“Venezuela’s peace is guaranteed,” Saab said in a speech upon taking the prosecutor’s position.

Right away, Saab conducted a purge of the country’s prosecutors and stripped authority from those who stayed. He fired as many as 300 officials considered disloyal and shut units focused on corruption and human rights abuses, seven former prosecutors told Reuters.

“Everything was centralized,” said one former prosecutor. “All instructions came from him.”

In November, Maduro personally submitted a draft of the Law Against Hate for Peaceful Coexistence to the new legislature. After a debate of less than two hours, the Constituent Assembly passed it with a unanimous show of hands. Legislators applauded and waved flags, shouting “long live the homeland!”

At a news conference the following day, Saab called upon Venezuelans to denounce violators. “Remember, now there is a very clear law in Venezuela that allows us to prosecute,” he said.

The law is vague, opponents objected, banning conduct such as “promoting national hate” without clearly defining it. Its six pages and 25 articles of text are mostly a tract on peace, tolerance, democracy and other values it ostensibly aims to protect. The legislation doesn’t specify what actions, statements, or other behavior constitute hatred.

As a result, pro-Maduro prosecutors and judges have room to allege hate as they see fit. “It’s a legal justification to do what they want,” Ortega, the former chief prosecutor, told Reuters. Ortega left Venezuela after resigning and now lives in Colombia.

In Saab’s first two years on the job, his office pressed few charges using the law. Espacio Público, an activist group that tracks the law’s implementation, reported just four arrests for inciting hatred in 2019. With the law’s rollout, however, the government increasingly asked teams in the Information Ministry and at the state telecommunications regulator to scan Twitter and Facebook for critical comments, according to six people familiar with those efforts.

This year, the country’s decrepit health system came under greater strain. For years, doctors and hospital administrators have angered the government by criticizing a lack of basic infrastructure and supplies – from latex gloves to running water to disinfectant. Outrage over coronavirus preparedness spurred more intense criticism.

Even before the virus was known to be infecting South America, doctors cautioned that Venezuela’s testing capacity is scant, its health data unreliable. Their warnings, epidemiologists say, were justified: Venezuela has since reported what appear to be unrealistically low infection figures. The country, with roughly 30 million people, has confirmed 107,177 COVID-19 cases and 949 deaths, a fraction the rate registered in neighboring Colombia and across Latin America.

Maduro pushed back. After opposition legislators in March said the government was ill prepared for coronavirus, the president in a speech said they were seeking to “torture Venezuelan minds.” He accused them of “manipulating” the pandemic for political purposes.

Within days, prosecutors ramped up use of the law.

“The peace of the republic is seriously threatened.”

On March 21, National Police officers arrived at the home of Darvinson Rojas, a freelance journalist. The day before, Rojas had challenged the government’s coronavirus statistics on Twitter, citing additional COVID-19 cases that had been reported by local authorities but left out of the national count. The officers, Rojas said, told him there was a coronavirus case in his building and that he needed to accompany them for a test at a nearby base.

Instead, officers jailed him and interrogated him about his tweets. At a court hearing two days later, a prosecutor charged Rojas with inciting hatred and spreading “false information,” according to Rojas and his attorney, Saúl Blanco. Blanco told Reuters the court didn’t let him read the case file and he wasn’t allowed to visit Rojas in jail.

After 12 days in a cell, a court released Rojas pending further investigation. The court barred him from leaving the country and told him to limit his reporting to conveying government statistics. Officials from the court didn’t respond to requests for comment.

He’s too frightened to report much on coronavirus now, Rojas told Reuters.

“I’ve left the subject alone,” he said.

“Hate among Venezuelans”

Giovanni Urbaneja had long irritated Belisario, the mayor of San José de Guanipa, a small city in the eastern state of Anzoátegui. Once a staunch Socialist, Urbaneja served as a state legislator when Venezuela was governed by the late Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor.

After Chávez died and Venezuela’s economy imploded, Urbaneja became disillusioned. With his wife, an attorney, he set up a foundation to provide legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. He used the platform to speak out against Maduro and other ruling party officials.

In a letter to Reuters from jail, Urbaneja, 54, said mismanagement and embezzlement had destroyed the local economy. Once a booming oil town, it is now the site of abandoned drilling rigs, shuttered stores and homes darkened by blackouts that sometimes last days. Urbaneja didn’t cite evidence for his accusations in the letter to Reuters or in the public statements that triggered the mayor’s demand for hate-law charges.

Belisario, 70, previously commanded Venezuela’s National Guard. He was elected mayor in late 2017. At first, Urbaneja said he supported the new mayor, believing his military experience would help him stomp out local corruption. But soon, Urbaneja found fault.

In a Facebook post in December 2018, Urbaneja called Belisario a “traitor,” alleging the mayor was letting local police rob and extort citizens. The mayor, in an official statement a few weeks later, denied the allegations. He accused Urbaneja of belonging to an “international conspiracy” to topple Maduro.

Last year, Urbaneja was invited by a private local radio station to discuss the public health system. On air, he said Belisario had failed to address a recent malaria outbreak. Minutes later, a local councilman and ally of Belisario burst into the studio and punched Urbaneja repeatedly, yelling that he was tired of the criticism.

Urbaneja, who lost consciousness in the beating, reported the assault to the office of Jairo Gil, the state prosecutor. Gil, who is the prosecutor now pursuing the hate-law case against Urbaneja, didn’t respond to questions from Reuters about the attack or the current investigation of his comments about the mayor. José Nassar, the radio host, confirmed details of the assault to a local newspaper. The alleged assailant, Rubén Herrera, was never charged. Neither Nassar nor Herrera responded to requests to discuss the incident.

The mayor, on another radio station shortly afterward, denied any involvement. “If this man’s dead body appears around here one morning,” he said of Urbaneja, “it won’t have anything to do with me.” In his text message to Reuters, Belisario said he never ordered any physical attack against Urbaneja.

Tensions escalated anew with coronavirus.

In a series of Facebook posts, Urbaneja accused Belisario and other government officials of misusing public health funds. “COVID-19 is their great business,” he wrote on August 9. The comments prompted Belisario’s request for the hate-law investigation.

In his letter to Gil, the state prosecutor, the mayor said Urbaneja’s posts were particularly worrisome at a time when Maduro’s government is subject to intense international and domestic opposition. “The peace of the republic is seriously threatened,” he wrote, by people promoting “violence, chaos, anarchy” and “hate among Venezuelans.”

Previously undisclosed court documents reviewed by Reuters show that after receiving the mayor’s request, Gil promptly ordered police to review Urbaneja’s social media accounts. Investigators then sent Gil a report with snapshots of Urbaneja’s posts. The posts, they wrote, “were against the nation’s leaders.”

On August 20, the documents show, Gil signed the order for Urbaneja’s arrest. That evening, municipal police, guns drawn, raided Urbaneja’s home. Martínez, his wife, held their one-year-old daughter as the officers hauled him away, she told Reuters.

Ever since, Urbaneja has been detained at a police base just a few blocks from Mayor Belisario’s office. He hasn’t been charged and has had only one court hearing so far, at which a judge authorized prosecutors to continue investigating. The detention, legal experts say, violates a law stipulating that suspects can only be held for 45 days without being formally charged with a crime.

In a handwritten letter to his lawyer, Adrián Moreno, Urbaneja said guards were keeping him “totally isolated.” To keep him from becoming a bad influence, he wrote, guards prevent him from speaking with other inmates.

Urbaneja blames his arrest on “desperation among officials cornered by corruption,” he told Reuters in a separate letter. “They are trying to silence my voice.”

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani defended on Monday the execution of a prominent dissident journalist based in France and captured by Iran last year, saying the death sentence passed on Ruhollah Zam was carried out lawfully.

European countries “have the right to comment, but Zam was executed upon a court’s ruling,” Rouhani told a televised news conference, noting that the judiciary was independent. “I think it’s unlikely that this will hurt Iran-Europe relations.”

Zam had been based in Paris and was seized last year in circumstances that have not been officially disclosed. A news agency close to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said last week he had been captured in Iraq.

He was convicted of fomenting violence during anti-government protests in 2017. His Amadnews social media feed had more than 1 million followers.

France called Zam’s execution on Saturday “barbaric and unacceptable”.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also called the execution “unjust, barbaric,” adding in a tweet: “Zam exposed the brutality and corruption of the regime, which has killed or arrested more than 860 journalists in its 41-year reign of terror.”

Iran’s foreign ministry summoned envoys from France and Germany, current holder of the European Union’s rotating presidency, to protest over criticism of the execution, Iranian media reported on Sunday."

Updated at 8:25 a.m. ET Monday

An opinion column in The Wall Street Journal came under fire over the weekend for asking educator and incoming first lady Jill Biden — who holds two master's degrees and a doctorate in education — to stop using the title ""Dr.""

In the op-ed published Friday evening, writer Joseph Epstein, former editor of The American Scholar magazine, urged Biden to drop the title, a message that public figures and women in academia panned on Twitter as misogynistic both in substance and tone.

""Madame First Lady — Mrs. Biden — Jill — kiddo,"" the piece begins. ""Any chance you might drop the 'Dr.' before your name? 'Dr. Jill Biden' sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic.""

Biden earned her doctorate from the University of Delaware in 2007. Biden's Obama White House biography describes the dissertation as focusing on ""maximizing student retention in community colleges."" Epstein disparaged the title of that dissertation as ""unpromising.""

""A wise man once said that no one should call himself 'Dr.' unless he has delivered a child,"" he continued. ""Think about it, Dr. Jill, and forthwith drop the doc.""

Epstein went on to argue that the prestige of doctorates and honorary degrees has been diminished by political correctness and the relaxation of academic standards before urging Biden to ""forget the small thrill of being Dr. Jill, and settle for the larger thrill of living for the next four years in the best public housing in the world as First Lady Jill Biden.""

In a tweet Sunday night, Biden said, ""Together, we will build a world where the accomplishments of our daughters will be celebrated, rather than diminished.""

The backlash over Epstein's op-ed was swift.

Northwestern University, where Epstein wrote that he had taught for 30 years, issued a statement saying it ""strongly disagrees with Mr. Epstein's misogynistic views"" and noting he has not been a lecturer there since 2003. The university's Department of English said in a separate statement that it rejects the opinion piece ""as well as the diminishment of anyone's duly-earned degrees in any field, from any university.""

Biden's spokesperson called the piece a ""disgusting and sexist attack"" in a tweet that addressed Wall Street Journal editors directly, adding, ""If you had any respect for women at all you would remove this repugnant display of chauvinism from your paper and apologize to her.""

The Wall Street Journal has not responded to NPR's request for comment.

""What patronizing, sexist, elitist drivel,"" tweeted Kate Bedingfield, the president-elect's communications director. ""Dr. B earned a doctorate in education, so we call her Doctor. The title Mr. Epstein has earned here is perhaps not fit for mixed company.""

Other voices from the Democratic Party weighed in on Twitter, expressing support for Biden and slamming the op-ed as misogynistic.

""The author could've used fewer words to just say 'ya know in my day we didn't have to respect women,' "" Chasten Buttigieg, husband of former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, wrote in a tweet that has since garnered more than 87,000 likes.

Doug Emhoff, husband of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, praised Biden's ""hard work and pure grit"" in a tweet Saturday, adding, ""This story would have never been written about a man.""

Other prominent voices shot down the idea that the title ""Dr."" should only apply to medical doctors.

The Merriam-Webster dictionary noted in a tweet Saturday that the word ""doctor"" comes from the Latin word for ""teacher,"" which the dictionary said first described theologians.

Bernice King, minister and daughter of civil rights activist the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., reminded Biden in a tweet that her father was a nonmedical doctor.

""And his work benefited humanity greatly,"" King wrote. ""Yours does, too.""

Epstein's article struck a particular chord among women in academia, who took to Twitter with their own searing criticisms and messages of empowerment.

Scores of women with doctorate degrees added ""Dr."" to their Twitter names in an act of solidarity. Many did so alongside the hashtag #mytitleisdr, encouraged by academics, including archaeologist Sarah Parcak.

Biden famously taught at Northern Virginia Community College while serving as second lady from 2008 to 2016, and plans to continue teaching after President-elect Joe Biden takes office. In a 2013 interview with NPR, Biden said she did not talk about her political role in the classroom.

""I think I have a separate role there as an English teacher and that's who I want to be,"" she said. ""I want to be Dr. B, their English teacher."""
Cleveland’s Baseball Team Will Drop Its Indians Team Name,35,kcypcx,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/sports/baseball/cleveland-indians-baseball-name-change.html,6,1607985187.0,,"The Cleveland team did not immediately comment.

In response to Cleveland’s decision, many fans praised the move, saying it was long overdue and proposing ideas for new names. Others — in particular President Trump — criticized the decision.

“Oh no!” Trump tweeted. “What is going on? This is not good news, even for ‘Indians’. Cancel culture at work!”

Other professional sports teams, including the Atlanta Braves, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Chicago Blackhawks, have said in recent months that they have no plans to change their names. Many universities and high schools abandoned Native American names and mascots long ago, but efforts to address the names at all levels of sport in the United States have increased in recent months.

For Cleveland, the process began when it announced it would retire its longtime mascot, Chief Wahoo, a cartoonish caricature that was seen as particularly offensive. Many applauded the decision, but insisted the team name must go, too.

Then in July, just hours after Washington announced it would change its name (under pressure from key sponsors like FedEx, Pepsi and Nike), Cleveland said it would conduct a “thorough review” of its nickname. The team has consulted with many Native American groups, both in Ohio and nationally.

“We are committed to engaging our community and appropriate stakeholders to determine the best path forward with regard to our team name,” the team said in a statement in July."
Biden Faces Intense Pressure From All Sides as He Seeks Diverse Cabinet,109,kcx317,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/12/us/politics/biden-administration-cabinet-advisers-diversity.html,32,1607979181.0,,"“I don’t carry around a stamp on my head saying ‘I’m progressive and I’m A.O.C.,’” Mr. Biden said, referring to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. “But I have more of a record of getting things done in the United States Congress than anybody you know.”

The comments reflect what people familiar with Mr. Biden’s thinking say is his growing frustration with the public and private pressure campaigns.

But promises to interest groups during his campaign tend not to be forgotten.

Alphonso David, the president of Human Rights Campaign, a group dedicated to advancing the interests of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, said Mr. Biden assured him months ago that he was committed to diversity in his appointments. For Mr. David, the goal is for an L.G.B.T.Q. person to be named to a cabinet-level position requiring Senate confirmation — something that has never happened.

“That is an important barrier to break. we need to make sure that all communities are represented,” Mr. David said. Like other activists, Mr. David hesitated to pass judgment on Mr. Biden until he finished picking his cabinet.

“It’s too soon to tell yet,” he said. But he added a warning that Mr. Biden has heard all too often in recent days.

“If we don’t have the diversity of representation that Joe Biden has been pledging and that we are looking for,” he said, “there will be huge disappointment.”

Still, defenders of the president elect are equally direct.

“He picked the first woman and first Black vice president. First woman Treasury secretary. First Black defense secretary,” said Philippe Reines, a veteran Democratic operative and former top adviser to Hillary Clinton. “But if they can’t trust Joe Biden to continue to do the right thing and seek to pick the cabinet, they should do what he did: run for and win the presidency.”

"Russian Hackers Broke Into Federal Agencies, U.S. Officials Suspect",9,kcn7zr,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-us-government-treasury-commerce.html,9,1607936871.0,,"The motive for the attack on the agency and the Treasury Department remains elusive, two people familiar with the matter said. One government official said it was too soon to tell how damaging the attacks were and how much material was lost, but according to several corporate officials, the attacks had been underway as early as this spring, meaning they continued undetected through months of the pandemic and the election season.

News of the breach, reported earlier by Reuters, came less than a week after the National Security Agency, which is responsible for breaking into foreign computer networks and defending the most sensitive U.S. national security systems, issued a warning that “Russian state-sponsored actors” were exploiting flaws in a system broadly used in the federal government.

At the time, the N.S.A. refused to give further details of what had prompted the urgent warning. Shortly afterward, FireEye announced that hackers working for a state had stolen some of its prized tools for finding vulnerabilities in its clients’ systems — including the federal government’s. That investigation also pointed toward the S.V.R., one of Russia’s leading intelligence agencies. It is often called Cozy Bear or A.P.T. 29, and it is known as a traditional collector of intelligence.

FireEye’s clients, including the Department of Homeland Security and intelligence agencies, hire the firm to conduct ingenious but benign hacks of their systems using the company’s large database of techniques it has seen around the world. Its “red team” tools — essentially imitating a real hacker — are used to plug security holes in networks. So the hackers who stole FireEye’s tools have added to their arsenal. But it appears that FireEye was hardly their only victim.

The global campaign, investigators now believe, involved the hackers inserting their code into periodic updates of software used to manage networks by a company called SolarWinds. Its products are widely used in corporate and federal networks, and the malware was carefully minimized to avoid detection.

The company, based in Austin, Texas, says it has more than 300,000 customers, including most of the nation’s Fortune 500 firms. But it is unclear how many of those use the Orion platform that the Russian hackers invaded, or whether they were all targets.

If the Russia connection is confirmed, it will be the most sophisticated known theft of American government data by Moscow since a two-year spree in 2014 and 2015, in which Russian intelligence agencies gained access to the unclassified email systems at the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It took years to undo the damage, but President Barack Obama decided at the time not to name the Russians as the perpetrators — a move that many in his administration now regard as a mistake."
Biden told civil rights leaders in private meeting that progressives' hopes for executive actions are 'way beyond the bounds' of his presidential authority,374,kcgvph,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/10/politics/joe-biden-audio-civil-rights-leaders/index.html,60,1607916453.0,,"(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden expressed skepticism about his powers to implement his agenda by executive action Tuesday in a private virtual meeting with civil rights leaders, according to a recording reported Thursday by The Intercept.

Biden told a group of seven leaders of civil rights organizations that some progressive Democrats are urging executive actions that are ""way beyond the bounds"" of a president's legal authority. The comments reflect what Biden has said publicly about the limited scope of executive action and the need for presidents to work with Congress to enact long-lasting policy.

In the meeting, Biden said he planned to roll back everything President Donald Trump has done through executive action, rather than with the approval of Congress. He said he would use his powers ""to undo every single damn thing this guy has done by executive authority.""

""I am not going to violate the Constitution. Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds,"" he said.

But, he said, he would not seek to use executive action to mandate policy changes that he has long said are up to Congress to make.

WASHINGTON (AP) — His time in the White House rapidly ending, President Donald Trump is rewarding some supporters and like-minded allies with the perks and prestige that come with serving on federal advisory boards and commissions.

On Thursday, Trump announced his intention to nominate two authors who wrote books that flattered him to a board that makes recommendations on education research. Another author who helped write a favorable book about the president was chosen for the same board a few days earlier.

On Wednesday, the Department of Defense announced that China hawk Michael Pillsbury would become the chair of a board that gives Pentagon leadership advice on how to enhance national security. Pillsbury has served as an outside adviser to the president on China.

And on Tuesday, Trump said he would appoint his former counselor and 2016 campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, to serve on the board of visitors to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Going to the same board will be Heidi Stirrup, an ally of top Trump adviser Stephen Miller. She served as a White House liaison at the Justice Department and was told to vacate the building when top department officials learned of her efforts to collect inside information about ongoing cases and the department’s work on election fraud.

Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was among the appointees to the board of trustees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She’s also married to Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and a perpetuator of Trump’s false claims of election fraud, will become a member of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board.

It’s not unusual for outgoing presidents to make a flurry of appointments to boards and commissions before leaving office. With three days to go in his tenure, President Barack Obama named senior advisor Valerie Jarrett and national security advisor Susan Rice to the Kennedy Center board.

Paul Light, an expert on the federal bureaucracy and a professor at New York University, describes the practice as “unseemly” and said that every administration does it.

“But nobody does these things with more politicization than Trump,” Light said.

The positions that Trump has filled in recent weeks are generally on advisory boards in which members go without a salary, though they get reimbursed for travel expenses. The positions have what Light describes as “gorgeous resume value.”

The number of advisory board positions has ballooned over the years. Light said that he believes past administrations have put in sincere work to match up people with the kind of credentials and experience Congress envisioned when it created those boards. He doesn’t see that same effort now.

“This is all favors repaid and favors earned,” Light said of Trump’s picks.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what the president is seeking to accomplish with the appointments and how he thinks they would enhance the work of the federal government.

Among the most consequential of the wave of appointments has been with advisory boards at the Pentagon.

There was Pillsbury’s appointment to the Defense Policy Board. In addition, the Pentagon announced the previous week that Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie would serve on a separate entity, the Defense Business Board. That board provides the Pentagon’s leadership with outside private sector perspectives. Lewandowski was the first of Trump’s three campaign managers in 2016. Bossie was tasked with helping the campaign’s legal challenges contesting this year’s presidential election.

They serve at the pleasure of the administration, so President-elect Joe Biden could move to replace them quickly.

In another recent move, Trump picked global warming skeptic David Legates to serve on the President’s Committee on the National Medal of Science. Legates co-wrote an article in April that stated: “Actual hurricane, tornado, sea level, flood, drought, and other historic records show no unprecedented trends or changes, no looming crisis, no evidence that humans have replaced the powerful natural forces that have always driven climate and weather in the real world outside the modelers’ labs.”

He’ll be among 12 scientists and engineers appointed to award the medal given to those who make outstanding contributions in the physical, biological, mathematical, or engineering sciences.

In September, Trump told California leaders struggling with the worsening wildfires associated with global warming that the climate would “start getting cooler” again. “You just watch,” he added.

Light said some of the picks struck him as Trump declaring: “I’m on my way out and I’m going to slap you one more time. ... You laughed at me on the way out, but I got the last decision.”"

In some places, angry confrontations between protesters and counterprotesters escalated into violence. There were a number of scuffles in the national capital, where four people were stabbed, and the police declared a riot in Olympia, Wash., where one person was shot.

In videos of a clash in Olympia that were posted on social media, a single gunshot can be heard as black-clad counterprotesters move toward members of the pro-Trump group, including one person waving a large Trump flag. After the gunshot, one of the counterprotesters is seen falling to the ground, and others call for help. In one video, a man with a gun can be seen running from the scene and putting on a red hat.

EXPLAINER: What’s in store when the Electoral College meets,121,kbxeyw,https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-inaugurations-elections-139323ffc1a937e6287c6e51eab9dd98,17,1607837402.0,,"1 of 4 All states have certified results of the 2020 presidential election ahead of a Dec. 14 meeting of electors.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Voters cast their ballots for president more than a month ago, but the votes that officially matter will be cast Monday. That’s when the Electoral College meets.

The Constitution gives the electors the power to choose the president, and when all the votes are counted Monday, President-elect Joe Biden is expected to have 306 electoral votes, more than the 270 needed to elect a president, to 232 votes for President Donald Trump.

The spotlight on the process is even greater this year because Trump has refused to concede the election and continued to make baseless allegations of fraud . That makes the meeting of the Electoral College another solid, undeniable step toward Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, when Biden will be sworn in as president.

Some questions and answers about the Electoral College:

WHAT EXACTLY IS THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE?

In drafting the Constitution, America’s founders struggled with how the new nation should choose its leader and ultimately created the Electoral College system. It was a compromise between electing the president by popular vote and having Congress choose the president.

ADVERTISEMENT

Under the Constitution, states get a number of electors equal to their total number of seats in Congress: two senators plus however many members the state has in the House of Representatives. With the exception of Maine and Nebraska, states award all of their electoral college votes to the winner of the popular vote in their state.

WHAT’S THE BEEF WITH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE?

The Electoral College has been the subject of criticism for more than two centuries. One often-repeated gripe: the person who wins the popular vote can nonetheless lose the presidential election. That happened twice in the last two decades — in 2000 with the election of George W. Bush and in 2016 when Donald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes .

Biden, for his part, won the popular vote and will end up with 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232. Trump was the fifth presidential candidate in American history to have lost the popular vote but won in the Electoral College.

WHO ARE THE ELECTORS?

Presidential electors typically are elected officials, political hopefuls or longtime party loyalists.

ADVERTISEMENT

This year, they include South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Trump elector who could be a 2024 Republican presidential candidate, and Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, her party’s 2018 nominee for governor and a key player in Biden’s win in the state.

Among others are 93-year-old Paul “Pete” McCloskey, a Biden elector who is a former Republican congressman who challenged Richard Nixon for the 1972 GOP presidential nomination on a platform opposing the Vietnam War; Floridian Maximo Alvarez, an immigrant from Cuba who worried in his Republican convention speech that anarchy and communism would overrun Biden’s America, and Muhammad Abdurrahman, a Minnesotan who tried to cast his electoral vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton in 2016.

WHERE DO THEY MEET AND WHAT DO THEY DO?

The Electoral College doesn’t meet in one place. Instead, each state’s electors and the electors for the District of Columbia meet in a place chosen by their legislature, usually the state capitol.

The election is low tech. Electors cast their votes by paper ballot: one ballot for president and one for vice president. The votes get counted and the electors sign six certificates with the results. Each certificate gets paired with a certificate from the governor detailing the state’s vote totals.

Those six packets then get mailed to various people specified by law. The most important copy, though, gets sent to the president of the Senate, the current vice president. This is the copy that will be officially counted later.

DO ELECTORS HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE CANDIDATE WHO WON THEIR STATE?

In 32 states and the District of Columbia, laws require electors to vote for the popular-vote winner. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld this arrangement in July. Electors almost always vote for the state winner anyway, because they generally are devoted to their political party.

A bit of an exception happened in 2016 when 10 electors tried to vote for other candidates. Those included people pledged to support Clinton who decided not to back her in a futile bid to get Republican electors to abandon Trump and choose someone else as president.

Abdurrahman, the Minnesotan who wanted to vote for Sanders, was replaced as an elector. This year, he has said he will cast his vote for Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Once the electoral votes are cast, they are sent to Congress, where both houses will convene on Jan. 6 for a session presided over by Vice President Mike Pence. The envelopes from each state and the District of Columbia will be opened and the votes tallied.

If at least one member of each house objects in writing to some electoral votes, the House and Senate meet separately to debate the issue. Both houses must vote to sustain the objection for it to matter, and the Democratic-led House is unlikely to go along with any objections to votes for Biden. Otherwise, the votes get counted as intended by the states.

And then there’s one more step: inauguration."
House Democrat Calls To Exclude 126 Republicans From Next Congress For Supporting Texas Lawsuit,465,kbj48i,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/12/11/house-democrat-calls-to-exclude-126-republicans-from-next-congress-for-supporting-texas-lawsuit/,112,1607777839.0,,"Topline

Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) on Friday urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to refuse to seat any of the 126 Republican House members who signed an amicus brief supporting a lawsuit aimed at overturning the results of the presidential election.

WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 25: U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), chairman of House Judiciary ... [+] Committee, arrives with Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) and Rep.

Key Facts

Pascrell, who has been among the most vocal proponents in Congress of investigations into President Trump, called on Pelosi in a letter to “exclude” any members who signed the brief, claiming they want to “tear the United States government apart.” Pascrell cites Section 3 of the 14th amendment – which states that anyone who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” cannot serve in federal office – claiming the lawsuit seeks to “obliterate public confidence in our democratic system” and that those who signed it committed “unbecoming acts that reflect poorly on our chamber.” The lawsuit the Republicans are supporting, brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and backed by 17 Republican attorneys general, asks the Supreme Court to invalidate electors in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan based on fraud claims already rejected by lowerthe courts numerous times. The Republicans who signed the brief include House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and incoming House GOP Conference Vice Chair Mike Johnson, who is spearheading the effort. Pelosi herself has signaled firm opposition to the Trump-backed effort, calling it “an act of flailing GOP desperation, which violates the principles enshrined in our American Democracy” in a letter to Democratic colleagues. ""Republicans are subverting the Constitution by their reckless and fruitless assault on our democracy,” Pelosi added in the letter, which was released after Pascrell’s, though she did not say whether she would heed his calls. Forbes has reached out to Pelosi and Johnson for comment.

Chief Critic

“Congress is just trolling each other at this point, despite currently being in session specifically to pass relief for millions of suffering Americans,” pollster Frank Luntz tweeted in response to Pascrell’s letter.

Tangent

One member of Congress who expressed support for Pascrell’s demands is Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a member of the progressive “squad.”

Crucial Quote

“President Trump… specifically asked me to contact all Republican Members of the House and Senate today and request that all join on to our brief,” Johnson said in an email to the Republican caucus obtained by Forbes. “He said he will anxiously be awaiting the final list to review.”

Big Number

70. That’s the number of House Republicans who did not sign the brief, a rare break in a battle largely defined by partisan lines. Just 23 Republican members of Congress – 14 House members, 9 senators – have acknowledged Biden’s victory.

Key Background

23 Democratic attorneys general filed a brief opposing the lawsuit, as did Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat whose state’s Republican attorney general is among the 17 supporting it. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds blocked her state’s Democratic attorney general from opposing it. But several Republicans have openly criticized it, including Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) – whose state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, brought the lawsuit – as well as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who called it an “unwise use of taxpayer money” after Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes signed the brief supporting it.

What To Watch For

The Supreme Court is expected to rule before the electoral college meets on Monday and a ruling could come as soon as Friday. The case is a long-shot, given that the Court refused to even hear a similar case brought by Pennsylvania Republicans."

A Texas state lawmaker announced this week that he planned to propose a referendum on whether the state should secede from the US.

""The federal government is out of control and does not represent the values of Texans,"" Rep. Kyle Biedermann, a Republican, said.

State Republicans and Democrats have criticized the proposal.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A Texas state lawmaker announced this week that he planned to propose a referendum on the state seceding from the US.

""The federal government is out of control and does not represent the values of Texans,"" State Rep. Kyle Biedermann, a Republican representing the greater San Antonio area since 2017, wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday.

""That is why I am committing to file legislation this session that will allow a referendum to give Texans a vote for the State of Texas to reassert its status as an independent nation,"" he added, along with the hashtag #Texit.

Talks around secession resurface every so often in Texas, but modern efforts to leave the union have not been successful. The state previously broke off from the country and joined the Confederate States of America in 1861. But after the Civil War, the Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. White that no state was legally allowed to secede.

The secession movement in Texas last gained momentum in 2016 after the United Kingdom's referendum to leave the European Union, commonly known as Brexit. Biedermann compared his proposal to Brexit in an interview with the local station Fox 7 on Thursday.

""The things that are happening in the federal government, whether it be our First Amendment rights, our Second Amendment rights, the budget and the debt going out of sight,"" Biedermann told Fox 7. ""And then the fact that we might even be looking at Texas being singled out about our oil and gas industry — we just can't afford to stay silent.""

Biedermann signaled he would use Article 1 Section 2 of the state's constitution to support his proposal, which reads: ""The faith of the people of Texas stands pledged to the preservation of a republican form of government, and, subject to this limitation only, they have at all times the inalienable right to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may think expedient.'""

The GOP lawmaker said he intended to introduce the bill next year, though other state Republicans have already signaled they do not support his plans.

""America needs Texas to lead, not secede,"" Texas Republican Party Chairman Allen West said in a statement to Insider.

Texas recently seized the national spotlight because of Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton's legal challenge to overturn the 2020 presidential-election results in President Donald Trump's favor. The Supreme Court is unlikely to consider the case, which seeks to invalidate votes in key battleground states won by President-elect Joe Biden.

""It is certainly understandable that people are frustrated with the situation after months of a pandemic and concerns they may have about the integrity of the election, but the solution isn't to dissolve or detach from the greatest nation in history,"" Republican House Speaker Dennis Bonnen told Insider. ""Instead, Texas needs to take care of Texas and continue to lead the nation by example with legislation that continues to pursue economic strength and freedom.""

Biedermann did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

State Democrats have similarly shut down the idea, according to The Dallas Morning News.

""You can't claim to be patriotic and file a bill for Texas to secede from the union,"" Abhi Rahman, a spokesperson for the Texas Democratic Party, told the newspaper. ""From Ken Paxton to Greg Abbott to Kyle Biedermann, Texas Republicans are supporting treason.""

The Texas Nationalist Movement, a pro-secession group, has sent Biedermann its nod of approval, saying, ""Texans are one step closer to having their voices heard on the issue of Texas independence.""

"Supreme Court Unanimously Denies Texas Emergency Relief, Refuses to Grant Motion for Leave to File (Updated)",392,kbfpvn,https://reason.com/volokh/2020/12/11/supreme-court-unanimously-denies-texas-emergency-relief-refuses-to-grant-motion-for-leave-to-file/,17,1607764471.0,,"This evening, in Texas v. Pennsylvania, a unanimous Supreme Court refused to grant Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton an injunction or other relief that would bar the selection of presidential electors in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. As detailed in the just-released order, seven justices would deny the Texas AG's Motion for Leave to file a complaint, citing a lack of Article III standing. Justices Alito and Thomas, citing their long-standing belief that the Court lacks the discretion to deny the motion, would have granted the motion, but would have provided Texas with no other relief. In other words, not a single justice believed Texas deserved the extraordinary relief it sought.

The Court's order reads:

The State of Texas's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot. Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins: In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction. See Arizona v. California, 589 U. S. ___ (Feb. 24, 2020) (Thomas, J., dissenting). I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.

This puts an end to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's effort to upend the results of the November election. It should also put an end to the efforts by the Trump campaign and its allies to delegitimize or otherwise challenge the election results.

This result was not a surprise. As I indicated in my prior posts on AG Paxton's initial filing, the intervening briefs, amici, state defendants' responses, and Paxton's feeble replies, this case never had merit. As the Court concluded, Texas could not satisfy the requirements of Article III standing to challenge the election procedures utilized by other states to select presidential electors. What is more, even the two justices who believed the Court was obligated to hear the case–arguably the Court's two most conservative justices–did not believe Texas was entitled to the extraordinary relief it sought, relief which would have been necessary for AG Paxton's last-ditch effort to have any result on the electoral college. AG Paxton's office submitted transparently weak arguments, and the Court summarily dispatched them.

It is important to underscore that the Supreme Court's decision is, for all practical purposes, unanimous. Justices Alito and Thomas have long held the view that when a state seeks to invoke the Court's original and exclusive jurisdiction, the Court is obligated to hear the case. (See, e.g., their dissent from the Court's refusal to hear Arizona v. California.) This is a serious argument, which Ilya Somin discussed here and which I suspect may be correct. So while the vote on Texas' Motion for Leave was technically 7-2 on this basis, the Court was 9-0 in rejecting AG Paxton's attempt to get any sort of actual relief, such as an injunction preventing states from appointing presidential electors. Not a single justice was willing to express any sympathy for any aspect of Texas's legal claims.

As for the rest of Justice Alito's statement, what ""other issue"" might he be referring to? I suspect this is a reference to the Pennsylvania litigation that is still pending, about which Justice Alito previously issued a statement.

On the rest of the Court's order, it is significant that the Court did not merely note the lack of standing, but also specified that Texas had not ""demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections."" In other words, one state cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts to challenge another states election processes, even when it concerns the selection of presidential electors. This should discourage other states from trying such things in the future, whether to raise Electors Clause claims, Equal Protection claims, or anything else.

As I have already noted, this should not have been a surprise to anyone who was paying attention. The briefs submitted by AG Paxton's office were weak on the facts and weak on the law. In some respects, as I noted in prior posts, they were downright embarrassing. The briefs filed in support of Paxton's claims were, on the whole, not much better. Those attorneys who were willing to file briefs that actually embraced the substance of Paxton's claims should be particularly embarrassed. If Paxton's own Solicitor General would not sign on to these briefs, why would the SG of Missouri or Utah?

There remains a serious legal question about the constitutionality of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision to extend the deadline for the receipt of absentee ballots beyond the statutory deadline. This decision has much in common with the decision of the Florida Supreme Court that was vacated by a unanimous Supreme Court in 2000. Unlike in 2000, however, the outcome of that question could not effect the election result. Nonetheless, if the Court wants to consider that issue, there are multiple pending petitions for certiorari (here, here, and here) that it could grant in the normal course. If anything, the legal events of the past few weeks should establish that the issue raised by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's actions are capable of repetition yet could evade review if not addressed by SCOTUS.

The #Kraken may have been released. Tonight's Supreme Court order should also have put it out of its misery.

P.S. Also in tonight's order, the Supreme Court also granted certiorari in Goldman Sachs Group v. Arkansas Teacher Retirement System.

UPDATE: I also recommend this analysis of the order by Howard Bashman at How Appealing. Among other things, he notes that Justice Alito's statement is styled as just that–a ""statement""–indicating it contains separate views and does not signify any dissent from the Court's order.

Supreme Court Rejects Texas Suit Seeking to Subvert Election,153,kbeb93,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/us/politics/supreme-court-election-texas.html?smid=tw-share,10,1607759369.0,,"Mr. Trump’s campaign did not immediately issue a statement. In an appearance on the conservative network Newsmax soon after the decision was announced, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, said that the campaign’s legal effort would continue, insisting that his team had originally planned for “four or five separate cases.”

“We’re not finished, believe me,” he said with a laugh at the end of the interview.

The president, who at a White House Hanukkah party earlier in the week eagerly mentioned the pending court case in his remarks, was scheduled to attend another holiday party around the time the ruling came down. But around 8:30 p.m., guests were informed that Mr. Trump would not be coming down from the residence to speak.

Mr. Trump weighed in later on Twitter. “The Supreme Court really let us down,” he said. “No Wisdom, No Courage!”

Friday’s order was not quite unanimous. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, issued a brief statement on a technical point. But it was nonetheless a comprehensive rebuke to Mr. Trump and his allies. It was plain that the justices had no patience for Texas’ attempt to enlist the court in an effort to tell other states how to run their elections.

The majority ruled that Texas could not file its lawsuit at all. “The state of Texas’ motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing,” the court’s order said.

Justice Alito, taking a slightly different approach, wrote that the court was not free immediately to shut down lawsuits filed by states directly in the court. “In my view,” he wrote, “we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction.”

But that was as far as those two justices were willing to go. “I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief,” Justice Alito wrote, “and I express no view on any other issue.”"
Manhattan D.A. Intensifies Investigation of Trump,273,kb6dc0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/nyregion/trump-taxes-cy-vance.html,7,1607734118.0,,"Employees of Deutsche Bank and Aon, two corporate giants, could be important witnesses. As two of Mr. Trump’s oldest allies — and some of the only mainstream companies willing to do regular business with him — they might offer investigators a rich vein of information about the Trump Organization.

There is no indication that either company is suspected of wrongdoing.

Because grand jury rules require secrecy, prosecutors have disclosed little about the focus of the inquiry and nothing about what investigative steps they have taken. But earlier this year, they suggested in court papers that they were examining possible insurance, tax and bank-related fraud in the president’s corporate dealings.

In recent weeks, Mr. Vance’s prosecutors questioned two Deutsche Bank employees about the bank’s procedures for making lending decisions, according to a person familiar with the interviews. The employees were experts in the bank’s underwriting process, not bankers who worked with the Trump Organization, the person said.

While the focus of those interviews was not on the relationship with Mr. Trump, bank officials expect Mr. Vance’s office to summon them for additional rounds of more specific questions in the near future, the person said.

Glimpses into the investigation have come in court records during the bitter and protracted legal battle over a subpoena for eight years of Mr. Trump’s personal and corporate tax returns and other financial records.

A month after Mr. Vance’s office demanded the documents from the president’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, in August 2019, Mr. Trump sued to block compliance with the subpoena. The case has twisted its way through the federal courts, with the president losing at every turn, and is now in front of the Supreme Court for the second time.

Danny Frost, a spokesman for Mr. Vance, declined to comment on recent moves in the investigation. Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s general counsel, declined to comment, but recently said that the company’s practices complied with the law and called the investigation a “fishing expedition.”"

BOULOGNE-SUR-MER, France (AP) — Long lines of trucks carrying stockpiles for British companies jam the highways leading to France’s northern port of Calais, while in the coastal town of Boulogne-sur-Mer, French fishermen pull in their lines and fear that battles over fishing rights will soon erupt.

Up and down France’s northern coast, the uncertainty of Brexit is causing ripples of chaos and frustration.

With just three weeks left to go before Britain is completely out of the European Union, no one knows if there will be a post-Brexit trade deal or a chaotic economic rupture between the two sides. Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 but remains in its massive market until the end of the year. That means, barring a trade agreement, New Year’s Day could herald quite a hangover for businesses on both sides of the English Channel.

For Mathieu Pinto, a 28-year-old French fisherman, a no-deal Brexit will disastrously impact his right to fish in British waters, where he says he makes “between 70% and 80%” of his yearly income.

Pinto is based in France’s coastal town of Boulogne, home to Europe’s largest fish-processing center. He had just returned from a night fishing sea-snails or whelk when he spoke to The Associated Press. He worries that his days of making a living in the family business could be numbered.

“(A no-deal Brexit) will already impact us hugely. And then we are going to have to share our French waters with foreigners as well,” he said.

That would mean fighting for fish in French maritime territory alongside northern EU neighbors from the Netherlands and Belgium, which he says could create an impossibly tense situation. There is simply is not enough catch to go around without access to UK waters, he said.

“There will be war. Let’s not hide it. There will be war,” Pinto said.

Ireland and Denmark are also among those directly affected by the potential closing off of U.K. waters.

Under current EU rules, EU countries can currently fish in British maritime territory, as they have for decades. But the overexploitation of these rules — and the seas — have meant that fish numbers have declined sharply. And so, too, did British fisherman. Saving British waters for U.K. fishermen became a rallying cry, fueling the Brexit vote for the U.K. to leave the bloc. Since then, fishing rules have remained a major issue at the heart of the Brexit impasse.

Meanwhile in Calais, trails of truck exhaust fumes on the roadside illustrate the path to Brexit is, literally, jammed with uncertainty.

And that has caused British companies to stockpile goods, leading to a huge increase in the number of trucks heading to Calais’ port and the undersea tunnel to Britain in the past few weeks. French police are delaying hundreds of trucks at the roadside to cope with the soaring traffic flow. It’s a perfect storm on the highways, coming just as a coronavirus-related tourism slump has reduced the number of vehicle-carrying ferries crossing the English Channel.

Sebastien Rivera, a top regional official for the National Road Transport Federation, an industry group that represents some 350 companies that send their goods to the U.K., blasted the situation as “catastrophic.”

“For about the last three weeks, we’ve seen an increase in the flow of traffic toward Great Britain due to stockpiling. The platforms, whether it’s the port or the (Euro)tunnel, don’t have capacity to absorb this increase in traffic,” he said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week there’s a “strong possibility” that negotiations on a new economic relationship with the EU to take effect Jan. 1 will fail. He and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have set a Sunday deadline to decide whether to keep talking or prepare for a no-deal break.

A failure to secure a trade deal would mean tariffs and other barriers going up that would hurt both sides, although most economists think the British economy would take a greater hit because the U.K. does almost half of its trade with the 27-nation bloc.

Rivera said the sheer uncertainty of what trade rules are going to be has caused enormous stress and additional costs to the transport industry, not to mention the hours of wasted time that truck drivers have spent stuck in traffic jams.

“It’s not right that we’re three weeks away and we don’t have answers,” he said.

HOUSTON (AP) — The Texas lawsuit asking the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate President-elect Joe Biden’s victory has quickly become a conservative litmus test, as 106 members of Congress and multiple state attorneys general signed onto the case even as some have predicted it will fail.

The last-gasp bid to subvert the results of the Nov. 3 election is demonstrating President Donald Trump’s enduring political power even as his term is set to end. And even though most of the signatories are far-right conservatives who come from deep red districts, the filing meant that roughly one-quarter of the U.S. House believes the Supreme Court should set aside election results.

Seventeen Republican attorneys general are backing the unprecedented case that Trump is calling “the big one” despite the fact that the president and his allies have lost dozens of times in courts across the country and have no evidence of widespread fraud. And in a filing Thursday, the Congressional Republicans claimed “unconstitutional irregularities” have “cast doubt” on the 2020 outcome and “the integrity of the American system of elections.”

To be clear, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud and Trump has been seeking to subvert the will of the voters. Election law experts think the lawsuit will never last.

“The Supreme Court is not going to overturn the election in the Texas case, as the President has told them to do,” tweeted Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “But we are in bad shape as a country that 17 states could support this shameful, anti-American filing” by Texas and its attorney general, Ken Paxton, he said.

The lawsuit filed against Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin repeats false, disproven, and unsubstantiated accusations about the voting in four states that went for Trump’s Democratic challenger. The case demands that the high court invalidate the states’ 62 total Electoral College votes. That’s an unprecedented remedy in American history: setting aside the votes of tens of millions of people, under the baseless claim the Republican incumbent lost a chance at a second term due to widespread fraud.

Two days after Paxton sued, 17 states filed a motion supporting the lawsuit, and on Thursday six of those states asked to join the case themselves. Trump has acted to join the case, tweeting Thursday that “the Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States.” Hours later, Trump held a meeting at the White House, scheduled before the suit was filed, with a dozen Republican attorneys general, including Paxton and several others who are backing the effort.

Still, some of the top state Republican prosecutors urging the Supreme Court to hear the case have acknowledged that the effort is a long shot and are seeking to distance themselves from Trump’s baseless allegations of fraud. North Dakota’s Wayne Stenehjem, among the 17 attorneys general supporting the case, said North Dakota is not alleging voter fraud in the four states at issue.

“We’re careful on that,” said Stenehjem, who noted that his office has received thousands of calls and emails from constituents asking the state to support the suit. “But it’s worth it for the Supreme Court to weigh in and settle it once and for all,” he said.

Montana Attorney General Tim Fox called the lawsuit “belated” and said its chances “are slim at best.” But Fox supported Texas because he said the case raised “important constitutional questions about the separation of powers and the integrity of mail-in ballots in those defendant states.”

Suits brought by Trump and his allies have failed repeatedly across the country , and the Supreme Court this week rejected a Republican bid to reverse Pennsylvania’s certification of Biden’s victory.

Trump looked straight past the high court loss , claiming it didn’t matter because his campaign wasn’t involved in the case, though it would have benefited if the case had continued. He has spent the week relentlessly tweeting about the Texas case with the hashtag “overturn” and claiming, falsely, that he had won the election but was robbed.

Many of the attorneys general supporting the case have shown greater political ambitions.

In Kansas, Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who is considering a bid for governor in 2022, said the Texas case presented “important and potentially recurring constitutional questions.” Schmidt’s announcement that Kansas would back the effort came only hours after former Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer — another potential candidate for governor — tweeted that Schmidt’s office should join the Texas litigation.

The case has stirred Republican infighting in Utah, where GOP Gov. Gary Herbert and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who will become governor in January, blasted Attorney General Sean Reyes for deciding to join the suit.

“The Attorney General did not consult us before signing on to this brief, so we don’t know what his motivation is,” they said in a joint statement. “Just as we would not want other states challenging Utah’s election results, we do not think we should intervene in other states’ elections.”

Officials in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin say the suit is a publicity stunt. More than 20 other attorneys general from states including California and Virginia also filed a brief Thursday urging the court to reject the case.

“Since Election Day, State and Federal courts throughout the country have been flooded with frivolous lawsuits aimed at disenfranchising large swaths of voters and undermining the legitimacy of the election. The State of Texas has now added its voice to the cacophony of bogus claims,” Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, wrote in the state’s brief.

Despite the political pressure, Idaho’s Republican attorney general chose not to join the Texas suit. Lawrence Wasden said he has concerns about “supporting a legal argument that could result in other states litigating against legal decisions made by Idaho’s legislature and governor.” Idaho’s two congressmen, Republicans Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher, joined the legal brief from GOP House members supporting Paxton’s effort.

“As is sometimes the case, the legally correct decision may not be the politically convenient decision,” Wasden said in a statement. “But my responsibility is to the state of Idaho and the rule of law.”

Morocco Joins List of Arab Nations to Begin Normalizing Relations With Israel,2,kat5aq,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-morocco-trump.html#click=https://t.co/W1BzXFAEwD,3,1607680725.0,,"WASHINGTON — Morocco has agreed to a rapprochement with Israel in return for American recognition of the kingdom’s sovereignty over a long-disputed territory, under a deal announced on Thursday that gives President Trump another diplomatic victory in his final weeks in office.

With the agreement, which has been under discussion since 2017, Morocco becomes the fourth Muslim-majority state to pledge warmer official relations with Israel this fall under accords brokered by the Trump administration.

It undercuts an independence movement in the Western Sahara region, which has rejected Morocco’s claims of sovereignty, with United Nations support, and could fuel instability in that yearslong dispute.

The Moroccan government downplayed the announcement from Washington that the move amounted to a full or new normalization with Israel, noting years of ongoing if opaque relations. Moroccan officials also conspicuously committed only to reopening so-called liaison offices with Israel — not embassies or consulates — pledging vaguely to “resume diplomatic relations as soon as possible.”"
Inside Biden’s Meeting With Civil Rights Leaders,23,kas9mp,https://theintercept.com/2020/12/10/biden-audio-meeting-civil-rights-leaders/,4,1607677753.0,,"Democrats in the House, Senate, and around the country have been urging President-elect Joe Biden to use the maximum amount of executive authority available to him in order to grow the economy, expand civil rights, protect the climate, and otherwise implement the agenda he ran on, despite the expected obstruction from a Republican Senate.

So there’s some things that I’m going to be able to do by executive order. I’m not going to hesitate to do it, but what I’m not going to do is I’m not going to do what used to — Vanita [Gupta], you probably used to get angry with me during the debates, when you’d have some of the people you were supporting saying, ‘On Day 1, I’m gonna have an executive order to do this!’ Not within the constitutional authority. I am not going to violate the Constitution. Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds. And as one of you said, maybe it was you, Reverend Al [Sharpton], whether it’s far left or far right, there is a Constitution. It’s our only hope. Our only hope and the way to deal with it is, where I have executive authority, I will use it to undo every single damn thing this guy has done by executive authority, but I’m not going to exercise executive authority where it’s a question, where I can come along and say, ‘I can do away with assault weapons.’ There’s no executive authority to do away that. And no one has fought harder to get rid of assault weapons than me, me, but you can’t do it by executive order. We do that, next guy comes along and says, Well, guess what? By executive order, I guess everybody can have machine guns again. So we gotta be careful.

Biden also warned the civil rights leaders that pressure on the incoming administration around police reform could hurt the party’s chances in the Georgia Senate runoffs, claiming that the Republicans’ ability to define that party as in favor of defunding the police is “how they beat the living hell out of us across the country.”

Biden insisted that his commitment to police reform was unwavering but argued that the branding effort had done too much damage.

Biden made his comments unprompted, referencing an earlier remark made by NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who had warned that appointing Tom Vilsack to be secretary of agriculture would anger Black farmers in Georgia, as well as Black voters generally in the state, for whom Shirley Sherrod was a hero. Sherrod was fired by Vilsack from her position as Georgia director of rural development for the U.S. Department of Agriculture during Vilsack’s previous tenure as agriculture secretary during the Obama administration. Her firing was quickly revealed to have been a mistake and based on an incomplete airing of a video by the late conservative provocateur Andrew Breitbart. Particularly in Georgia, Johnson noted, Vilsack’s capitulation was still a sore spot, and nominating him would be “disastrous” electorally. “If you consider the victory that you appreciated in Georgia, it was around 12,000 votes. And so as you consider appointments, you also must consider what impact would that have on voters in the state of Georgia. And I will submit to you that former Secretary Vilsack could have a disastrous impact on voters in Georgia. Shirley Sherrod is a civil rights legend, a hero,” Johnson said."
"COVID data manager investigated, raided for using publicly available password",35,kap1r2,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/florida-posted-the-password-to-a-key-disaster-system-on-its-website/,3,1607667128.0,,"Florida police said a raid they conducted Monday on the Tallahassee home of Rebekah Jones, a data scientist the state fired from her job in May, was part of an investigation into an unauthorized access of a state emergency-responder system. It turns out, however, that not only do all state employees with access to that system share a single username and password, but also those credentials are publicly available on the Internet for anyone to read.

The background

Jones on Monday shared a video of the police raid on her house as part of a Twitter thread in which she explained the police were serving a search warrant on her house following a complaint from the Department of Health. That complaint, in turn, was related to a message sent to Florida emergency responders back in November.

About 1,700 members of Florida's emergency-response team received the communication on November 10, according to the affidavit (PDF) cited in the search warrant for Jones' home. The message urged recipients to ""speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it's too late.""

That unauthorized message was sent to the contact list for Florida's Emergency Support Function 8, or ESF-8, one of 18 groups of Florida state emergency-response personnel. ESF-8 is headed under the Florida Department of Health and coordinates public health response, including ""triage, treatment, and transportation"" across multiple agencies. All users in the group share the same username and password, the affidavit confirms. Investigators looked at system logs and identified an IPv6 address associated with the message, which they then determined to be connected to Jones' house.

After the raid on her home, Jones gave multiple media interviews in which she repeatedly denied having anything to do with the message. To CNN, for example, she said, ""I'm not a hacker,"" and added that neither the tone nor the content of the message matches her communication style.

(In)security

In November, when the message went out, state DOH spokesman Jason Mahon declined to answer the Tampa Bay Times' questions about ""what, if anything, had been done to better secure the emergency alert system against future hacks, nor whether there have been other instances where the system had been hacked.""

It now seems the Times' question may have gone unanswered because the Florida Department of Health had no answer, other than to continue bad security practices.

""All users assigned to [ESF-8 tools] share the same username and password,"" the affidavit cited in the search warrant confirmed. That set of login credentials apparently does not change when users resign or are fired; instead, ""once [employees] are no longer associated with ESF8 they are no longer authorized to access the multi-user group.""

That set of account credentials that all users share is part of a logistics operation manual that is publicly searchable and accessible on the Florida DOH's website.

A link to the manual was shared in a Reddit thread discussing the raid on Jones' house, which multiple Ars readers flagged to us. (Thanks!) We are choosing not to share a direct link, but as of publication time, the link was still live and working.

The document is a guideline for ESF-8 logistics staff. The first section includes a list of tasks management needs to complete in certain given periods. The second section includes a list of systems log-in information along with points of contact for each of those systems if they should be needed. It's the kind of information anyone who has worked in an administrative or support role for any organization has likely had on hand—for internal use only.

Ars contacted the Florida Department of Health about the document prior to publication; officials did not immediately provide a response. We will update this story if we receive additional comment.

"CDC’s Redfield told staff to delete email, official tells House watchdog",84,kaim5o,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/10/cdc-redfield-email-house-watchdog-444238,6,1607647096.0,,"Rep. Jim Clyburn, who chairs the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, on Thursday raised concern the episode may be among ""deliberate efforts by the Trump Administration to conceal and destroy evidence"" of political meddling in the pandemic response. In a letter to Redfield and HHS Secretary Alex Azar, he said that instructing staff to delete documents is unethical and possibly a violation of federal record-keeping requirements, according to a copy shared with POLITICO.

CDC Director Robert Redfield instructed staff to delete an email from a Trump political appointee seeking control over the agency’s scientific reports on the pandemic, a senior CDC official told congressional investigators this week. | Screenshot of Paul Alexander's email

""Federal employees have affirmative obligations to preserve documents, and destruction of federal records is potentially illegal,"" Clyburn warned in the letter. ""Federal law also provides for up to three years of imprisonment for willful destruction of federal records.""

Redfield in a Thursday afternoon statement didn't deny telling staff to delete the email, though he said he instructed them to ""ignore Dr. Alexander's comments.""

""As I testified before Congress, I am fully committed to maintaining the independence of the MMWR, and I stand by that statement,"" Redfield said.

POLITICO first reported on Sept. 11 that Alexander had demanded — and received — the right to review the CDC's reports, with the approval of top HHS officials. The agency’s MMWR reports, authored by career scientists, are typically free of political interference, and revelations that Trump officials had sought to alter their findings alarmed public health experts who depend on them. Democrats later announced a probe into the Trump administration’s interactions with the federal science agencies.

An HHS spokesperson, while ignoring questions about whether Redfield had asked staff to delete the email, said the House subcommittee had wrongly characterized Kent's remarks — a complaint echoed by the panel's top Republican.

""We urge the Subcommittee to release the transcript in full which will show that during her testimony Dr. Kent repeatedly said there was no political interference in the MMWR process,"" the HHS spokesperson said.

Kent did not respond to a request for comment.

She also told investigators that the CDC, in an earlier incident, delayed the publication of a July report on coronavirus spread at a Georgia summer camp following a ""requested delay by Dr. Redfield and HHS."" The report was held for two days and instead released about 15 minutes after Redfield concluded testimony to Clyburn's panel.

Clyburn said the subcommittee is still waiting for documents that it requested on Sept. 14. In his letter, he also threatened to subpoena HHS and CDC if they didn’t comply with his subcommittee’s ongoing probe.

Following Kent's interview with investigators on Monday, HHS canceled four interviews that had been scheduled with top CDC staff, including CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat, Acting Chief of Staff Nina Witkofsky, Acting Deputy Chief of Staff Trey Moeller and communications official Kate Galatas. According to the oversight committee, HHS complained that the panel overstepped the bounds of its investigation during Kent’s interview.

The HHS spokesperson, who requested anonymity, said the subcommittee was ""not operating in good faith."" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Lousiana, the top Republican on the coronavirus subcommittee, said the Democrats' investigation has turned up ""zero evidence of actual interference in CDC scientific reports.""

Alexander, who has since left HHS, spent months pushing career scientific officials to align their messages with Trump's downplaying of the virus. In September, he tried to prevent infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci from speaking about the risks the coronavirus posed to children. In a Sept. 11 email previously obtained by POLITICO, Alexander also urged CDC officials to alter a report on the virus' risks to young Americans, complicating the agency's own efforts to review that report.

CDC Director Robert Redfield instructed staff to delete an email from a Trump political appointee seeking control over the agency’s scientific reports on the pandemic, a senior CDC official told congressional investigators this week. | Screenshot of Paul Alexander's email

In Alexander's Aug. 8 email, which was previously obtained by POLITICO, he insisted on an ""immediate stop on all CDC MMWR reports due to the incompleteness of reporting.""

""Nothing to go out unless I read and agree with the findings how the CDC wrote it and I tweak it to ensure it is fair and balanced and 'complete,'"" Alexander added, in a breach of the scientific firewall that CDC has maintained for decades.

In the lengthy email, which switches between red and black font and yellow and blue highlighted text, Alexander laid out demands for retroactive changes to the CDC's reports and insisted that the agency's career scientists were trying to subvert Trump's reelection bid.

HHS announced Sept. 16 that Alexander would exit the department, the same day that Caputo took leave.

"'Is this what we're becoming?': Anne Frank memorial in Idaho, the only one in US, defaced with swastika stickers",537,kahdsn,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/09/anne-frank-memorial-idaho-swastika-stickers-vandalism/3872658001/,133,1607643344.0,,"CLOSE Anne Frank’s family reportedly tried to escape to both the United States and Cuba.

The only Anne Frank memorial in the United States was vandalized Tuesday, a distressing display of hate that has prompted a police investigation, officials said.

""It's sad that this is becoming a statement of who and what our community is,"" said Dan Prinzig, director of the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights, which maintains the memorial in Boise, Idaho.

The memorial includes a life-size bronze statue of Frank, which depicts her holding her diary and peering out the window of the secret annex in which she and her family spent 761 days hiding from Nazis before they were found and sent to concentration camps in 1944.

Stickers with swastikas and the words ""We are everywhere"" were found affixed to the diary, and another was pasted to a statue representing the “spiral of injustice.""

""Is this what we're becoming?"" Prinzig asked.

Another sticker was pasted over a photo of Bill Wassmuth, the center's namesake. He was a Catholic priest who left the priesthood to focus on fighting white supremacists and the Aryan Nations, a neo-Nazi group that, at the time, was based in northern Idaho. Wassmuth died in 2002.

(Photo: Courtesy of the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights)

The defamation of the memorial, which Prinzig called a ""stab to the heart,"" has been a rallying cry for the community. Several community members asked Prinzig to hold a physical vigil, while others started fundraising drives, he said.

Boise Police Chief Ryan Lee called the vandalism “absolutely reprehensible,” and said his agency has reached out to the Anti-Defamation League as part of its investigation.

“It does cause us concern,” Lee said. “We are committed to ferreting out ... those who would foment hate in the community.""

This is not the first time the memorial has been vandalized since its 2002 dedication. It was also defaced over a series of days in 2017 when graffiti of anti-Semitic and racist slurs caused $20,000 in damage.

The damage is not only to the memorial itself, Prinzig said, but to the ""psyche of the community.""

This is an ""important moment in really beginning to question ourselves: Who are we and what (are we) doing to fight injustice?"" he said.

Prinzig echoed the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, which he said are etched into the memorial.

“Where, after all, do human rights begin? In small places, close to home – so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world,"" he said.

Prominent artificial intelligence scholar Timnit Gebru helped improve Google’s public image as a company that elevates Black computer scientists and questions harmful uses of AI technology.

But internally, Gebru, a leader in the field of AI ethics, was not shy about voicing doubts about those commitments — until she was pushed out of the company this week in a dispute over a research paper examining the societal dangers of an emerging branch of AI.

Gebru announced on Twitter she was fired. Google told employees she resigned. More than 1,200 Google employees have signed on to an open letter calling the incident “unprecedented research censorship” and faulting the company for racism and defensiveness.

ADVERTISEMENT

The furor over Gebru’s abrupt departure is the latest incident raising questions about whether Google has strayed so far away from its original “Don’t Be Evil” motto that the company now routinely ousts employees who dare to challenge management. The exit of Gebru, who is Black, also raised further doubts about diversity and inclusion at a company where Black women account for just 1.6% of the workforce.

And it’s exposed concerns beyond Google about whether showy efforts at ethical AI — ranging from a White House executive order this week to ethics review teams set up throughout the tech industry — are of little use when their conclusions might threaten profits or national interests.

Gebru has been a star in the AI ethics world who spent her early tech career working on Apple products and got her doctorate studying computer vision at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

She’s co-founder of the group Black in AI, which promotes Black employment and leadership in the field. She’s known for a landmark 2018 study that found racial and gender bias in facial recognition software.

Gebru had recently been working on a paper examining the risks of developing computer systems that analyze huge databases of human language and use that to create their own human-like text. The paper, a copy of which was shown to The Associated Press, mentions Google’s own new technology, used in its search business, as well as those developed by others.

Besides flagging the potential dangers of bias, the paper also cited the environmental cost of chugging so much energy to run the models — an important issue at a company that brags about its commitment to being carbon neutral since 2007 as it strives to become even greener.

Google managers had concerns about omissions in the work and its timing, and wanted the names of Google employees taken off the study, but Gebru objected, according to an exchange of emails shared with the AP and first published by Platformer .

ADVERTISEMENT

Jeff Dean, Google’s chief of AI research, reiterated Google’s position about the study in a statement Friday.

The paper raised valid points but “had some important gaps that prevented us from being comfortable putting Google affiliation on it,” Dean wrote.

“For example, it didn’t include important findings on how models can be made more efficient and actually reduce overall environmental impact, and it didn’t take into account some recent work at Google and elsewhere on mitigating bias,” Dean added.

Gebru on Tuesday vented her frustrations about the process to an internal diversity-and-inclusion email group at Google, with the subject line: “Silencing Marginalized Voices in Every Way Possible.” Gebru said on Twitter that’s the email that got her fired.

Dean, in an email to employees, said the company accepted “her decision to resign from Google” because she told managers she’d leave if her demands about the study were not met.

“Ousting Timnit for having the audacity to demand research integrity severely undermines Google’s credibility for supporting rigorous research on AI ethics and algorithmic auditing,” said Joy Buolamwini, a graduate researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-authored the 2018 facial recognition study with Gebru.

“She deserves more than Google knew how to give, and now she is an all-star free agent who will continue to transform the tech industry,” Buolamwini said in an email Friday.

How Google will handle its AI ethics initiative and the internal dissent sparked by Gebru’s exit is one of a number of problems facing the company heading into the new year.

At the same time she was on her way out, the National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday cast another spotlight on Google’s workplace. In a complaint, the NRLB accused the company of spying on employees during a 2019 effort to organize a union before the company fired two activist workers for engaging in activities allowed under U.S. law. Google has denied the allegations in the case, which is scheduled for an April hearing.

Google has also been cast as a profit-mongering bully by the U.S. Justice Department in an antitrust lawsuit alleging the company has been illegally abusing the power of its dominant search engine and other popular digital services to stifle competition. The company also denies any wrongdoing in that legal battle, which may drag on for years.

Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden under federal investigation for tax case,0,ka6fpv,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/hunter-biden-under-federal-investigation-over-taxes.html,7,1607595750.0,,"Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden attend an NCAA basketball game between Georgetown University and Duke University in Washington, January 30, 2010.

Hunter Biden said in a statement, ""I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs.""

The probe was disclosed five days before Joe Biden, a former senator from Delaware, is expected to be formally selected as the next president by the Electoral College.

President-elect Joe Biden 's son Hunter Biden revealed Wednesday that he is under investigation for his ""tax affairs"" by federal prosecutors in Delaware.

""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,"" Hunter Biden said.

Hunter Biden, a lawyer whose late brother Beau Biden was Delaware's attorney general before he died, did not reveal any other details of the probe.

Kim Reeves, a spokeswoman for David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, in an email said, ""Per DOJ [Department of Justice] policy, we cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.""

CNN later reported Wednesday that it had contacted Hunter Biden's lawyer and his father's presidential campaign last week seeking comment on the investigation, which CNN reported is ""examining multiple financial issues, including whether Hunter Biden and associates violated tax and money laundering laws in business dealings in foreign countries, principally China.""

CNN reported that the investigation had been ""largely dormant in recent months"" due to Justice Department rules that bar taking legal actions in cases that could affect an election.

Publicly available documents show Hunter and his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle had an Internal Revenue Service lien against them for taxes not paid, possibly including interest and penalties, totaling $112,805.09, until this past March. The documents, filed by the IRS, show the lien was placed in November 2019. It is not immediately clear if the lien has anything to do with the investigation.

Separately, Hunter Biden had individual income tax liens of almost $453,890 placed on him by the District of Columbia on July 9, related to taxes owed for 2017 and 2018, according to a document on file in D.C. Recorder of Deeds Office. Those liens were cancelled six days later, records show.

The District of Columbia's income tax rate is 8.95 percent for income above $1 million annually, plus about $85,000.

The New York Post reported in October that the FBI seized both a computer and a hard drive believed to be Hunter Biden's in December 2019, after the owner of a computer repair shop in Wilmington, Delaware, notified federal authorities he had possession of those items.

The store owner also gave a copy of the hard drive to a lawyer for Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney for President Donald Trump, the Post reported. Giuliani then gave a copy of the hard drive to the newspaper.

In a statement Wednesday, the transition team of Democrat Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said, ""President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.""

The White House and the U.S. Department of Justice, which oversees U.S. attorneys' offices, declined to comment.

Hunter Biden has long struggled with drug addiction and other personal issues.

Earlier this year he faced being held in contempt of court for failing to disclose financial information to an Arkansas woman who said she bore his child.

Lawyers for that woman, Lunden Alexis Roberts, said in January that Hunter Biden failed to meet a court-ordered deadline to turn over documents dating back five years as part of her request for child-support payments for her then-16-month-old child.

Those documents included ""a list of all sources of income,"" copies of tax returns, and a list of companies in which he has an ownership interest, court records showed.

Hunter Biden, who initially claimed he never had sex with Roberts, later stopped contesting that he was the child's father.

He settled the case with Roberts in March by agreeing to pay her an undisclosed amount each month for child support, and by agreeing to maintain health insurance for the child. He also agreed to pay Roberts an undisclosed sum of money, which apparently also included her attorney's fees and costs.

During the presidential election, Republican Trump and his allies made Hunter Biden a focal point of political attacks, particularly in connection with his business dealings in Ukraine and China.

Hunter Biden and his father have denied any wrongdoing in relation to his business overseas, which Joe Biden says that he played no role in.

Trump, who refuses to concede that he lost the election, last year was impeached by the House of Representatives for withholding congressionally appropriated military aid for Ukraine as he pressured that nation's new president to investigate the Bidens. Trump was acquitted by the Senate after a trial.

In an interview last week, Joe Biden told CNN that after he becomes president, he will not try to influence decisions by the Justice Department.

""It's not my Justice Department. It's the people's Justice Department,"" Biden said.

He also said that the department will have ""independent capacity to decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn't.""

The disclosure of the investigation of Hunter Biden comes as Trump's company, the Trump Organization, is under criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office for how it accounted for hush money payments to women who said they had sex with Trump. The president has denied having sex with either woman, porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.

The DA's office also might be investigating possible tax crimes, as well as bank and insurance fraud, court filings suggest.

Trump is currently fighting efforts by DA Cyrus Vance Jr. to obtain eight years worth of the president's tax returns and other financial records from his longtime accountants.

At the same time, the New York attorney general's office is conducting a civil investigation into possible misstatement of the value of real estate owned by the Trump Organization. The president's son Eric Trump recently was questioned by investigators from the AG's office as part of that probe.

Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, who is a senior White House advisor, was deposed last week for a lawsuit filed by the Washington, D.C, attorney general's office. That AG accuses the Trump Organization, the Trump Inaugural Committee and the Trump International Hotel in that city of ""blatantly and unlawfully abusing nonprofit funds to enrich the Trump family"" in connection with spending on Trump's 2017 inauguration.

Ivanka Trump and her other adult brother Donald Trump Jr. narrowly avoided being criminally charged by Vance's office in 2012 in connection with the marketing of the Trump SoHo hotel in New York, according to an investigation by The New Yorker, ProPublica and WNYC. Vance's office had eyed whether prospective buyers were misled about the project's success.

The outlets reported that Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Ivanka and Donald Jr., had donated $25,000 to Vance's reelection campaign and directly appealed to him that the case should be dropped.

17 states tell Supreme Court they support Texas bid to reverse Biden win,279,ka5kwo,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/states-tell-supreme-court-they-support-texas-bid-to-reverse-biden-win.html,109,1607592798.0,,"People hold campaign flags supporting U.S. President Donald Trump outside of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2020.

The states supporting the suit, all of which have Republican attorneys general, are Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia.

Later Wednesday, Trump filed a motion to intervene in the case ""in his personal capacity"" as a presidential candidate . The Supreme Court has yet to rule on Paxton's request.

The filing backing Paxton by those states came a day after he asked the Supreme Court for permission to sue Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which Biden won, over their voting processes.

Seventeen states whose elections were won by President Donald Trump told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that they support Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's bid to file a lawsuit that could effectively reverse President-elect Joe Biden 's projected Electoral College victory.

Trump defeated Biden in the popular vote in all of those states, though one of Nebraska's electoral votes was awarded to Biden.

Representatives for the four battleground states being targeted in the lawsuit did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

After Trump asked to intervene in the case, 17 former officials and lawmakers filed their own brief supporting the four swing states. They argued Paxton's case does not belong in the Supreme Court, suggesting his claims could be made elsewhere.

""The Constitution does not make this Court the multidistrict litigation panel for trials of presidential election disputes,"" the brief said.

The court filing was signed by former officials who had worked in Republican administrations, as well as multiple former members of the House and Senate.

Paxton's case makes ""a mockery of federalism and separation of powers,"" their brief said.

""It would violate the most fundamental constitutional principles for this Court to serve as the trial court for presidential election disputes.""

Paxton, a Republican who remains under indictment for state felony securities fraud charges, is asking the high court for permission to sue the four states to block their certification of Biden's wins in them.

Paxton argues that a block is warranted because of supposedly improper changes to voting procedures there in the past year, purportedly different treatment of voters in Democratic-heavy areas, and voting ""irregularities.""

The four swing-state defendants are set to file their replies in opposition to Paxton's requests of the court by 3 p.m. on Thursday.

The effort comes as all states have certified their individual presidential election results, which show that Biden easily won the national popular vote.

Biden is projected to win the Electoral College when it meets Monday with 36 more votes than the 270-vote minimum needed to clinch the White House.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Tuesday said Paxton's filing ""is a publicity stunt, not a serious legal pleading.""

""The erosion of confidence in our democratic system isn't attributable to the good people of Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia or Pennsylvania but rather to partisan officials, like Mr. Paxton, who place loyalty to a person over loyalty to their country,"" Nessel said in a statement.

""The Michigan issues raised in this complaint have already been thoroughly litigated and roundly rejected in both state and federal courts – by judges appointed from both political parties. Mr. Paxton's actions are beneath the dignity of the office of Attorney General and the people of the great state of Texas.""

Trump has refused to concede the election to Biden, claiming without evidence that he was the victim of widespread ballot fraud.

Trump and his campaign, as well as their political allies, have repeatedly failed in their legal attempts to invalidate votes for Biden.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear a separate bid from Trump-allied Republicans challenging Biden's win in Pennsylvania.

Election law experts saw that apparently unanimous rejection as a signal that the remaining efforts to overturn Biden's win were all but doomed at the Supreme Court.

But the GOP plaintiffs in that case plan to petition the high court for a formal appeal, The Hill reported Wednesday.

The president and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, recently have pushed for legislatures in battleground states whose popular elections were won by Biden to overrule their citizens, and to appoint a slate of electors for Trump to the Electoral College."
"FTC, 47 states file suits to break up Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook",36,ka0uzj,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/ftc-48-states-file-suits-to-break-up-instagram-and-whatsapp-from-facebook/,3,1607577308.0,,"The Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of 47 states attorneys general today filed a pair of long-awaited antitrust suits against Facebook, alleging that the company abused its power in the marketplace to neutralize competitors through acquisitions and prevent anyone else from presenting a more privacy-friendly alternative to consumers.

""By using its vast troves of data and money, Facebook has quashed or hindered what the company perceived as potential threats,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the states' effort, said. ""In an effort to maintain its market dominance, Facebook has employed a strategy to impede competing services.""

The lawsuit brought by the states (PDF) asks the court to prohibit Facebook from engaging in ""any anticompetitive conduct"" or practice going forward. That includes a request for Facebook to be blocked from any acquisitions valued at greater than $10 million without first getting permission from the states.

The states also explicitly ask that Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp be found in violation of the Clayton Act and that Facebook be required to divest those businesses if necessary ""to restore competitive conditions"" in the marketplace.

The suit filed by the FTC (PDF) also calls for Facebook to face more scrutiny when it acquires other firms and to be broken up if necessary to restore competition in the marketplace.

""Facebook's actions to entrench and maintain its monopoly deny consumers the benefits of competition,"" FTC Bureau of Competition Director Ian Conner said. ""Our aim is to roll back Facebook's anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.""

Both cases were filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.

""We're reviewing the complaints and will have more to say soon,"" Facebook said in its original statement (which it made in a tweet). ""Years after the FTC cleared our acquisitions, the government now wants a do-over with no regard for the impact that precedent would have on the broader business community or the people who choose our products every day.""

If you can’t beat ‘em, buy ‘em

As we've explained before, antitrust law isn't just about being a literal monopoly or even about being the biggest player in a sector. Instead, it's about power—how much you have, and what you do with it. Antitrust investigators basically want to answer the question: did you become the biggest naturally, or did you cheat along the way?

In that framing, then, Facebook stands accused of cheating to beat out any potential competition—a lot.

Facebook was pretty much instantly popular when it first hit Harvard and other Boston-area colleges in 2004, but its path to world domination didn't truly take off until it began acquiring other tech firms a few years later.

Most of those early acquisitions were of small businesses or of patents—basically, a way to bring new tools and developers in-house to bolster the Facebook platform. Its first major blockbuster deal was its $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012. That transaction was controversial even at the time, with company CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly going around Facebook's board to get it done, but antitrust regulators nonetheless allowed the deal to go through.

That was the beginning, not the end, of Facebook's billion-dollar acquisition spree. In February 2014, Facebook offered a whopping $16 billion to acquire WhatsApp (a deal that eventually cost $19 billion), a messaging platform with enormous popularity outside of the United States. The social media giant followed that up one month later with a $2 billion deal to buy VR hardware developer Oculus.

Emails obtained by Congress earlier this year as part of its investigation into Big Tech's outsized power revealed that Zuckerberg explicitly thought of Instagram as a threat before acquiring it.

If apps such as Instagram were allowed to grow, Zuckerberg wrote in a 2012 email, it ""could be very disruptive"" to Facebook, and he added that an acquisition ""will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get to their scale again.""

Facebook's failed attempts to acquire potential competitors, such as Snapchat, also demonstrate its anticompetitive strategy, both suits allege.

What next?

Facebook has known for a long time that legal trouble was brewing, and it's had years to prepare for what's likely to be a long and ugly court battle.

The FTC and the states both launched their antitrust investigations back in the long-long ago of 2019, as did Congress, European Union competition regulators, and regulators from several other nations. The Congressional report, published in October, now seems like a harbinger of today's suit: the House committee found that Facebook (as well as Apple, Google, and Amazon) exerts monopoly power in the marketplace and should be forced to split up.

It's incredibly rare in the modern era for the courts actually to force a company to break up for antitrust reasons. The last major breakup came more than 35 years ago, when AT&T finally split up in to the seven regional ""Baby Bells"" after a decade-long legal fight with the Justice Department. The court initially ordered a breakup in the Microsoft antitrust case that began in the late 1990s, but Microsoft appealed the ruling and, in 2001, reached a settlement with the DOJ that left its business intact.

Some of Facebook's app updates from earlier this year seem to have been designed with a potential antitrust suit in mind: the company in late 2019 began a plan to integrate WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram Direct messaging into a single service. The integration between Instagram's and Facebook's messaging services began in August; when all three platforms are combined, Facebook will reach an estimated 3.3 billion users on a single messaging service.

So many knots to untie

That kind of tie-up makes the businesses logistically much more challenging to unwind, and Facebook seems likely to argue that integration of the services is vital to its business strategy and should be permitted to continue.

""The claims being reported—serial predatory acquisition and withholding interoperability—set up a strong case,"" said Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at Public Knowledge. ""This action reflects a lot of work from advocates, experts, and enforcement officials to build the case, first that Facebook was deserving of scrutiny, and then that the company really has run afoul of our antitrust laws. To fix the harms to competition, we need to see changes to Facebook's business and the company should be required to open up its network to competitors so that users are not locked in."""
YouTube to remove new videos that falsely claim fraud changed U.S. election outcome,351,k9vy9d,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-youtube/update-1-youtube-to-remove-new-videos-that-falsely-claim-fraud-changed-us-election-outcome-idUSL4N2IP3F2,144,1607562953.0,,"(Reuters) -YouTube said on Wednesday it would start removing content that falsely allege widespread fraud changed the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, in a change to its more hands-off stance on videos making similar claims.

The update, which applies to content uploaded from Wednesday, comes a day after “safe harbor”, a deadline set by U.S. law for states to certify the results of the presidential election.

YouTube said it would start enforcing the policy in line with its approach towards historical U.S. presidential elections.

Online platforms have been under pressure to police misinformation about the election on their sites.

YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc’s Google, was widely seen as taking a more hands-off approach than Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, which started labeling content with election misinformation. YouTube labels all election-related videos.

After the November election, Reuters identified several YouTube channels making money from ads and memberships that were amplifying debunked accusations about voting fraud.

Last month, a group of Democratic senators asked YouTube to commit to removing content containing false or misleading information about the 2020 election outcome and the upcoming Senate run-off elections in Georgia.

Asked about how the policy would apply to Georgia elections, a YouTube spokeswoman said this policy only applied to the presidential election.

YouTube said in a blog post on Wednesday that since September it had removed over 8,000 channels and thousands of misleading election-related videos for violating its existing policies. (bit.ly/37PCGy0)

The company said more than 70% of recommendations on election-related topics came from authoritative news sources.

YouTube also said that since Election Day, fact-check information panels had been triggered over 200,000 times on election-related search results."
New White House offer adds $600 checks to COVID-19 relief,10,k9ufnr,https://apnews.com/article/white-house-adds-600-coronavirus-relief-be17500a2fe22c09ba27d8ae9be8fec6,7,1607558415.0,,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Still spinning their wheels on COVID-19 relief, lawmakers grabbed a one-week government funding extension on Wednesday that buys time for more talks — though there is considerable disagreement over who is supposed to be taking the lead from there.

Amid the uncertainty, the House easily passed a one-week government-wide funding bill that sets a new Dec. 18 deadline for Congress to wrap up both the COVID-19 relief measure and a $1.4 trillion catchall spending bill that is also overdue. The 343-67 vote sent the one-week bill to the Senate, where it’s expected to easily pass before a deadline of midnight Friday to avert a partial government shutdown.

The measure would give lawmakers more time to sort through the hot mess they have created for themselves after months of futile negotiations and posturing and recent rounds of flip-flopping.

Top GOP leaders said the right people to handle endgame negotiations are the top four leaders of Congress and the Trump administration, focused on a proposal by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to eliminate a Democratic demand for a $160 billion or so aid package for state and local governments.

Top Democrats. meanwhile, are placing their bets on a bipartisan group of senators who are trying to iron out a $908 billion package. The bipartisan group is getting no encouragement from McConnell, but members are claiming progress on perhaps the most contentious item, a demand by the Kentucky Republican to award businesses and other organizations protections against COVID-related lawsuits.

“We’re trying to get a bipartisan compromise along the lines of the Gang of Eight framework,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “We need Leader McConnell to stop sabotaging the talks and work with this gang of eight, which is the most hopeful and the only bipartisan group together.”

Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., however, said the only way to resolve the negotiations is for McConnell, Pelosi and the White House to take charge.

“The bipartisan group provided a good foundation kind of a place to start from. And hopefully, the negotiations are real negotiations on what can ultimately pass the House, the Senate, and get signed,” Thune said. “We need to get under way.”

The Trump administration is back in the middle of the negotiations, offering a $916 billion package on Tuesday that would send a $600 direct payment to most Americans but eliminate a $300-per-week employment benefit favored by the bipartisan group of Senate negotiators.

The offer arrived Tuesday came with the endorsement of the top House Republican and apparent backing from McConnell, who had previously favored a $519 billion GOP plan that has already failed twice. But Democrats immediately blasted the plan over the administration’s refusal to back the partial restoration, to $300 per week, of bonus pandemic jobless benefits that lapsed in August.

“I think everybody is encouraged that there is a real framework here that everybody agrees on and there’s a few issues that are still the sticking points,” Treasury Secretary Steven Muchin told reporters Wednesday. “The two biggest issues are the money for state and local governments and liability protections. If we can’t resolve those, we can move forward on everything else. I don’t want to tell a bunch of small businesses that they can’t get (paycheck protection) loans.”

President-elect Joe Biden is pressing for as much pandemic relief as possible, though he’s not directly involved in the talks. McConnell says Congress will not adjourn without providing the long-overdue COVID-19 relief. The pressure to deliver is intense — all sides say failure isn’t an option.

The bipartisan negotiating group — led by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, among others — is seeking to rally lawmakers behind a $908 billion framework that includes a $300-per-week pandemic jobless benefit and $160 billion for states and local governments. It is more generous than a plan assembled by McConnell but far smaller than a wish list assembled by House Democrats.

Details leaked Wednesday on less controversial elements of their plan, including a four-month extension of jobless benefits set to expire at the end of the month, $300 billion for “paycheck protection” subsidies for struggling businesses, funding for vaccines and testing, and a host of smaller items like aid to transit systems, the Postal Service and health care providers.

Negotiations continue on a hotly contested liability shield from COVID-related lawsuits brought against businesses, universities and others that have reopened during the pandemic. The liability issue is regarded as a key to an eventual agreement that would pair the business relief with a $160 billion state and local aid package sought by Democrats.

“Right now we’re targeting struggling families, failing businesses, health care workers and we don’t have a stimulus check to every single person, regardless of need,” said Collins.

But there’s clear momentum for another round of payments going out to taxpayers despite reservations among rank-and-file Republicans concerned about corralling costs.

A potential COVID agreement would catch a ride on a separate $1.4 trillion government-wide spending bill that has its own set of problems, including fights over protections for the sage grouse, the Census, and accounting maneuvers being employed by lawmakers to squeeze $12 billion more into the legislation.

“We’re still looking for a way forward,” McConnell said Wednesday morning.

Pelosi said she’s encouraged about the reports she’s hearing from the bipartisan talks.

“I think that we’re close,” Pelosi said. “That’s what they tell me.”"

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — An explosion damaged a Polish supermarket in a Dutch town near Amsterdam early Wednesday morning, the third such blast in two days.

Police said the explosion happened at a store in the town of Beverwijk, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Amsterdam. Nobody was injured, but the store was badly damaged in the explosion at 5:15 a.m. (0415 GMT).

Dutch media reported that the owner of the store also owns another Polish supermarket in Aalsmeer that was gutted by an explosion and fire early Tuesday. The same night, another explosion hit a Polish supermarket in the southern town of Heeswijk-Dinther.

"A suspected Chinese spy slept with at least 2 mayors and got close to Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell in a yearslong intelligence campaign, report says",3,k9dptj,https://www.yahoo.com/news/suspected-chinese-spy-slept-least-130946174.html,3,1607492475.0,,"Fang Fang, also known as Christine Fang, embedded herself in Bay Area politics and slept with two Midwestern mayors as part of a yearslong Chinese intelligence campaign, according to an Axios investigation.

She also fundraised for Reps. Eric Swalwell and Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Axios said.

According to the outlet, Fang returned to China in mid-2015 amid an FBI investigation into her activities. She has not returned to the US since.

Fang's story shows the lengths that Beijing goes to influence American politics — getting cozy with politicians early on in their careers so it can influence them later on.

Axios' story was published a day after President Donald Trump retweeted a video that purported to show a Chinese professor saying: ""We have people at the top of America's core inner circle of power and influence.""

A suspected Chinese spy slept with at least two US mayors and got close to numerous Bay Area politicians in a yearslong intelligence campaign directed at influencing American officials early in their careers, according to a new report from Axios.

Fang Fang, also known as Christine Fang, was heavily involved in Bay Area and national US politics from 2011 to 2015, the outlet reported.

Two of the candidates Fang reportedly fundraised for - Rep. Eric Swalwell and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard - both ran for president in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Axios said.

According to Axios, Swalwell has not been accused of wrongdoing, and said he cut ties with Fang as soon as he learned about her alleged connections to China. Gabbard told Axios via a spokesperson that she has ""no recollection of ever meeting or talking with"" Fang.

Story continues

According to Axios, Fang abruptly left the US in mid-2015 amid an FBI investigation into her activities, and has not returned to the US since. The Justice Department has not filed any charges against her.

Fang's story shows China's strategy of targeting up-and-coming politicians to influence them years down the line, when they gain more prominence.

Axios said it spoke to four current and former US intelligence officials about the case, as well as 22 current and former elected officials, political operatives, and former students who knew Fang, to report the story.

Here's a summary of the outlet's report:

Fang was in her late 20s or early 30s when she came to the US in 2011 and enrolled as a student at California State University East Bay, according to friends and acquaintances.

Fang used her position as president of school groups at CSU East Bay to start cultivating relationships with politicians.

Fang soon became a mainstay at Bay Area political events, volunteered on campaigns, and helped fundraise for Democratic politicians like now-Reps. Eric Swalwell and Tulsi Gabbard.

Fang started getting close to Swalwell when he was a councilmember for Dublin City, California. She developed close ties to his office, helped bring in big donors, and even placed an intern in his Washington, DC office.

Fang expanded her network nationally by attending a 2014 conference for mayors in Washington, DC, according to multiple sources who spoke to Axios.

A US intelligence official and one former elected official said that Fang engaged in sexual or romantic relationships with at least two mayors of Midwestern cities, though Axios was not able to identify either mayor.

One of the mayors was described as an older Midwestern mayor ""from an obscure city"" who referred to Fang as his ""girlfriend"" in conversation, according to former Cupertino Mayor Gilbert Wong.

A sexual encounter involving Fang and an Ohio mayor was also caught on FBI surveillance, according to one US official.

Fang came on the radar of US counterintelligence officials as they were investigating another suspected Chinese spy, a current US counterintelligence official said.

Fang was put under FBI surveillance, and in 2015, senior US intelligence officials started tipping off the politicians that Fang was getting close to, one official said.

In mid-2015, Fang abruptly left the country and returned to China, which came as a surprise to many of her Bay Area political contacts. She has not been back since.

US officials do not believe Fang received or passed on classified information. But one current senior US intelligence official said the case was big nonetheless ""because there were some really, really sensitive people that were caught up"" in her ""intelligence network.""

Axios' report was published on Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump retweeted a Tucker Carlson report that included a video of a Beijing professor saying: ""We have people at the top of America's core inner circle of power and influence.""

Last week, Trump's spy chief wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, warning that China poses ""the greatest threat to America today.""

In the op-ed, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, wrote that ""this year China engaged in a massive influence campaign that included targeting several dozen members of Congress and congressional aides.""

Bill Evanina, director of the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center, also warned last week that China was already starting to target President-elect Joe Biden and his team.

Trump passed up chance to lock in 100 million more Pfizer COVID vaccine doses,12,k96eie,https://www.ocregister.com/2020/12/08/trump-passed-up-chance-to-lock-in-100-million-more-pfizer-covid-vaccine-doses/,3,1607470790.0,,"By ZEKE MILLER | Associated Press

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump celebrated the expected approval of the first U.S. vaccine for the coronavirus Tuesday as the White House worked to instill confidence in the massive distribution effort that will largely be executed by President-elect Joe Biden.

Trump said the expected approvals are coming before most people thought possible. “They say it’s somewhat of a miracle and I think that’s true,” he declared.

Trump led Tuesday’s White House event celebrating “Operation Warp Speed,” his administration’s effort to produce and distribute safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19. The first vaccine, from drugmaker Pfizer, is expected to receive endorsement by a panel of Food and Drug Administration advisers as soon as this week, with delivery of 100 million doses — enough for 50 million Americans — expected in coming months.

“Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine and we think by spring we’re going to be in a position nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago,” Trump said.

Pfizer developed its vaccine outside of “Operation Warp Speed,” but is partnering with the federal government on manufacturing and distribution.

England began its first vaccinations earlier Tuesday, to great fanfare, as the world mounts its fight against the pandemic that has killed more than 285,000 Americans and some 1.5 million people worldwide.

Trump and his aides hope to tamp down skepticism among some Americans about the vaccines and help build the outgoing Republican president’s legacy.

However, Trump’s administration was also facing new scrutiny Tuesday after failing to lock in a chance to buy millions of additional doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, which has been shown to be highly effective against COVID-19. That decision could delay the delivery of a second batch of doses until Pfizer fulfills other international contracts.

Trump used Tuesday’s event to sign an executive order in which the secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to ensure that Americans have priority access to the vaccine.

A senior administration official said the order would restrict the federal government from delivering doses to other nations until there is excess supply to meet domestic demand, but it was not immediately clear what the practical impact would be.

Tuesday’s “Operation Warp Speed” event featured Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a host of government experts, state leaders and business executives, as the White House looked to explain that the vaccine is safe and lay out the administration’s plans to bring it to the American people. But officials from Biden’s transition team, which will oversee the bulk of the largest vaccination program in the nation’s history once he takes office Jan. 20, were not invited.

Biden, who was rolling out his senior health team on Tuesday, said last week that in meetings with Trump administration officials his aides have discovered that “there’s no detailed plan that we’ve seen” for how to get the vaccines out of containers, into syringes and then into people’s arms.

Trump administration officials insist that such plans have been developed, with the bulk of the work falling to states and local governments to ensure their most vulnerable populations are vaccinated first. In all, about 50,000 vaccination sites are enrolled in the government’s distribution system.

But career officials insisted it was still too early to declare victory.

“”We don’t want to get out in front of ourselves,” said Army Gen. Gustave Perna, responsible for overseeing the logistical and distribution efforts. “As my father used to say, ‘You can only spike the football when you’re in the end zone.’ Well, what is the end zone described to us here? Shots in arms.”

Speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden promised to distribute “100 million shots in the first 100 days” of his administration — roughly on pace with Trump’s projections for vaccination.

Introducing his pandemic response team on Tuesday, Biden laid out his priorities for the start of his new government. He repeated his previous calls for all Americans to wear masks for 100 days to prevent the spread of the virus and said he’d mandate doing so in federal buildings and on public transportation. Biden also said he believed the virus could be brought under enough control to reopen “the majority of schools” within his first 100 days as president.

Those pledges came even as Biden struck a somber tone about the toll the coronavirus has already taken. He said that, after about nine months of living with the pandemic, the U.S. is “at risk of becoming numb to its toll on all of us” and “resigned to feel that there’s nothing we can do.”

Trump, meanwhile, defended his decision to hold indoor holiday parties at the White House this December, though they have attracted hundreds of largely mask-less supporters contrary to his administration’s warnings that the American public should avoid such settings.

“Well, they’re Christmas parties,” he told reporters Tuesday.

Though Trump was taking credit for the pace of vaccine development, much of the groundwork was laid over the past decade, amid new research into messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines — of the sort developed by both Pfizer and Moderna.

“The speed is a reflection of years of work that went before,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, told The Associated Press this month. “That’s what the public has to understand.”

Fauci, who will serve as a chief scientific adviser to Biden’s administration, appeared virtually at the president-elect’s event, but did not attend the White House summit. The White House did include early clips of Fauci predicting a longer development time for the vaccines in a round-up of skeptics of Trump’s timetable.

The Trump administration insists that between the Pfizer vaccine, the vaccine from Moderna and others in the pipeline, the U.S. will be able to accommodate any American who wants to be vaccinated by the end of the second quarter of 2021.

The Food and Drug Administration’s panel of outside vaccine experts is to meet Thursday to conduct a final review of the Pfizer vaccine, and it will meet later this month on the Moderna version.

FDA decisions on the two vaccines are expected within days of each meeting. Both have been determined to be 95% effective against the virus that causes COVID-19. Plans call for distributing and then administering about 40 million doses of the two companies’ vaccines by the end of the year — with the first doses shipping within hours of FDA clearance.

The decision not to secure additional Pfizer purchases last summer was first reported by The New York Times. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told NBC the administration is “continuing to work across manufacturers to expand the availability of releasable, of FDA-approved vaccine as quickly as possible. … We do still have that option for an additional 500 million doses.”

Dr. Moncef Slaoui, who is leading the government’s vaccine effort, noted the Trump administration had been looking at a number of different vaccines during the summer. He told ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Tuesday that “no one reasonably would buy more from any one of those vaccines because we didn’t know which one would work and which one would be better than the other.”

Texas sues four battleground states in Supreme Court over 'unlawful election results' in 2020 presidential race,401,k96s7w,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/texas-sues-four-battleground-states-in-supreme-court-over-unlawful-election-results.html,115,1607471991.0,,"Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the suit a ""publicity stunt"" and ""beneath the dignity"" of Paxton's office. Josh Kaul, the attorney general of Wisconsin, said in a statement the case was ""genuinely embarrassing.""

""Texas alleges that there are 80,000 forged signatures on absentee ballots in Georgia, but they don't bring forward a single person who this happened to. That's because it didn't happen,"" Fuchs' statement said.

The claims in Texas' lawsuit ""are false and irresponsible,"" Georgia's deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs, said in a fiery statement shortly after Paxton announced the legal action.

The Lone Star State's attempt to discount other states' electoral votes follows a slew of long-shot legal challenges with similar goals that have been brought in lower courts by Trump's campaign and other attorneys. Those lawsuits have repeatedly failed to invalidate ballots cast for Biden.

""Any electoral college votes cast by such presidential electors appointed"" in those states ""cannot be counted,"" Texas asks the high court to rule.

The filing argues that those states used the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to unlawfully change their election rules ""through executive fiat or friendly lawsuits, thereby weakening ballot integrity.""

The unusual lawsuit , which was filed directly to the Supreme Court, asserts that ""unlawful election results"" in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan — all of which Biden won — should be declared unconstitutional.

Texas' Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, on Tuesday announced a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate presidential election results in four key swing states that helped secure Democrat Joe Biden 's victory over President Donald Trump .

Experts in election law were also quick to dismiss the likelihood of the nine Supreme Court justices taking the case. Paul Smith, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who has argued voting rights cases at the Supreme Court, said the case was ""wacko.""

""There is a whole system in Pennsylvania and the other states for contesting the election — that's all been done,"" said Smith, who also serves as vice president of litigation and strategy at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. ""I don't think the Supreme Court will have interest in this.""

The professor added that Texas could run into trouble in proving that it has grounds to sue, known in legal terms as ""standing.""

""It's totally unprecedented, the idea that one state would, at the Supreme Court, claim that other states' votes were cast in the wrong way — that's never happened,"" he said. ""What is the injury to the state of Texas because Pennsylvania's votes were cast for Mr. Biden instead of Mr. Trump? There is no connection there.""

Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, wrote on his popular legal blog that the suit was ""utter garbage"" and also disputed the idea that Texas had standing, noting that ""it has no say over how other states choose electors.""

Paxton wrote in the brief that Texas has standing because of its interest in which party controls the Senate, which it says ""represents the States.""

""While Americans likely care more about who is elected President, the States have a distinct interest in who is elected Vice President and thus who can cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate,"" he wrote.

""This injury is particularly acute in 2020, where a Senate majority often will hang on the Vice President's tie-breaking vote because of the nearly equal—and, depending on the outcome of Georgia run-off elections in January, possibly equal — balance between political parties,"" Paxton added.

The lawsuit against the four states comes on a pivotal deadline in the election certification process, known as the ""safe harbor"" threshold, after which Congress is compelled to accept states' certified results.

Six days later, electors in the Electoral College will cast their votes, finalizing Biden's win. The suit is also asking the Supreme Court to extend that Dec. 14 deadline ""to allow these investigations to be completed.""

In most cases, the Supreme Court only hears cases from lower courts that have been appealed. In cases between two or more states, however, the court has original jurisdiction. It generally requires four justices to agree to hear a case.

The suit comes as Paxton faces an FBI criminal investigation related to alleged efforts to help a wealthy campaign donor. The investigation was confirmed by The Associated Press after seven senior lawyers in Paxton's office claimed to authorities in September that Paxton was guilty of abusing his office.

All seven have since been fired, put on leave or resigned, spurring a whistleblower lawsuit from several of them. Paxton has denied wrongdoing.

The case is not the first over the election to reach the justices, though the court has yet to deliver a substantial ruling for either side. In another suit the court could soon weigh in on, Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, a Trump ally, is challenging virtually all of the state's mail-in ballots, urging the court to nullify millions of votes.

Biden is projected to win 306 Electoral College votes — 36 more than needed to beat Trump, who is set to receive 232 such votes.

But Trump is refusing to concede to Biden. The president, more than a month after Election Day, continues to falsely insist he won the race while spreading a wide array of unproven conspiracy theories that purport to show electoral or voter fraud.

The president is also pressuring swing-state officials to take action toward overturning the results of their elections. Trump has heaped criticism on Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, while angrily demanding that he call a special session of the Peach State's legislature in order to appoint pro-Trump electors.

Trump has personally reached out to Kemp and Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler, according to reporting from The Washington Post. In November, Trump hosted Republican lawmakers in Michigan at the White House for a meeting. Those lawmakers said after the event that they had no plans to replace Biden's electors.

At a Covid vaccine summit at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, Trump once again falsely claimed he won the race, adding, ""let's see whether or not somebody has the courage, whether it's a legislator or legislatures, or whether it's a justice of the Supreme Court or a number of justices of the Supreme Court ... to do what everybody in this country knows is right.""

Even before the election, Trump predicted that the Supreme Court would likely decide the results of the race, and pressed the GOP-controlled Senate to confirm Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the bench in time for it to do so.

In recent weeks, however, as his legal challenges have floundered, Trump has acknowledged that he is unlikely to overturn the results of the 2020 election in court.

""Well, the problem is, it's hard to get into the Supreme Court,"" Trump told Fox News last month in his first full interview since his Nov. 3 defeat.

""I've got the best Supreme Court advocates, lawyers, that want to argue the case, if it gets there. They said, 'It's very hard to get a case up there,'"" Trump added. ""Can you imagine, Donald Trump, president of the United States, files a case, and I probably can't get a case."""
Exclusive: Suspected Chinese spy targeted California politicians,3,k9468w,https://www.axios.com/china-spy-california-politicians-9d2dfb99-f839-4e00-8bd8-59dec0daf589.html,3,1607463000.0,,"A suspected Chinese intelligence operative developed extensive ties with local and national politicians, including a U.S. congressman, in what U.S. officials believe was a political intelligence operation run by China’s main civilian spy agency between 2011 and 2015, Axios found in a yearlong investigation.

Why it matters: The alleged operation offers a rare window into how Beijing has tried to gain access to and influence U.S. political circles.

While this suspected operative’s activities appear to have ended during the Obama administration, concerns about Beijing's influence operations have spanned President Trump’s time in office and will continue to be a core focus for U.S. counterintelligence during the Biden administration.

Judy Chu; Fang with then-Rep. Mike Honda and then-San Jose city Councilmember Ash Kalra at a March 2014 event at the Chinese Embassy in D.C. Sources: Renren, Facebook, Facebook

The woman at the center of the operation, a Chinese national named Fang Fang or Christine Fang, targeted up-and-coming local politicians in the Bay Area and across the country who had the potential to make it big on the national stage.

Through campaign fundraising, extensive networking, personal charisma, and romantic or sexual relationships with at least two Midwestern mayors, Fang was able to gain proximity to political power, according to current and former U.S. intelligence officials and one former elected official.

Even though U.S. officials do not believe Fang received or passed on classified information, the case ""was a big deal, because there were some really, really sensitive people that were caught up"" in the intelligence network, a current senior U.S. intelligence official said.

Private but unclassified information about government officials — such as their habits, preferences, schedules, social networks, and even rumors about them — is a form of political intelligence. Collecting such information is a key part of what foreign intelligence agencies do.

Among the most significant targets of Fang's efforts was Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.).

Fang took part in fundraising activity for Swalwell’s 2014 re-election campaign, according to a Bay Area political operative and a current U.S. intelligence official. Swalwell’s office was directly aware of these activities on its behalf, the political operative said. That same political operative, who witnessed Fang fundraising on Swalwell's behalf, found no evidence of illegal contributions.

Federal Election Commission records don’t indicate Fang herself made donations, which are prohibited from foreign nationals.

Fang helped place at least one intern in Swalwell's office, according to those same two people, and interacted with Swalwell at multiple events over the course of several years.

A statement from Swalwell's office provided to Axios said: ""Rep. Swalwell, long ago, provided information about this person — whom he met more than eight years ago, and whom he hasn’t seen in nearly six years — to the FBI. To protect information that might be classified, he will not participate in your story.""

What happened: Amid a widening counterintelligence probe, federal investigators became so alarmed by Fang's behavior and activities that around 2015 they alerted Swalwell to their concerns — giving him what is known as a defensive briefing.

Swalwell immediately cut off all ties to Fang, according to a current U.S. intelligence official, and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

Fang left the country unexpectedly in mid-2015 amid the investigation. She did not respond to multiple attempts by Axios to reach her by email and Facebook.

Between the lines: The case demonstrates China’s strategy of cultivating relationships that may take years or even decades to bear fruit. The Chinese Communist Party knows that today’s mayors and city council members are tomorrow’s governors and members of Congress.

In the years since the Fang probe, the FBI has prioritized investigations into Chinese influence operations, creating a unit in May 2019 within the bureau solely dedicated to countering Beijing’s activities at the state and local levels. U.S. national security officials believe the threat posed by China has only grown with time.

""She was just one of lots of agents,"" said a current senior U.S. intelligence official.

Beijing ""is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign,"" FBI director Chris Wray said in a July 2020 speech. These efforts involve ""subversive, undeclared, criminal, or coercive attempts to sway our government’s policies, distort our country's public discourse, and undermine confidence in our democratic processes and values,"" Wray said.

The FBI declined to comment. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

Details: Axios spoke with four current and former U.S. intelligence officials about the case over a period of more than a year. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media about the case.

Axios also spoke with 22 current and former elected officials, political operatives, and former students who knew Fang personally when she was based in the United States.

The cover: How Fang worked

Fang’s friends and acquaintances said she was in her late 20s or early 30s when she was based in the U.S. and was enrolled as a student at a Bay Area university.

She used political gatherings, civic society conferences, campaign rallies, and campus events to connect with elected officials and other prominent figures, according to U.S. intelligence officials, Bay Area political operatives, former students, and current and former elected officials who knew her.

U.S. intelligence officials believed she was overseeing likely unwitting subagents whom she helped place in local political and congressional offices.

Fang attended regional conferences for U.S. mayors, which allowed her to grow her network of politicians across the country.

She also engaged in sexual or romantic relationships with at least two mayors of Midwestern cities over a period of about three years, according to one U.S. intelligence official and one former elected official.

At least two separate sexual interactions with elected officials, including one of these Midwestern mayors, were caught on FBI electronic surveillance of Fang, according to two intelligence officials. Axios was unable to identify or speak to the elected officials.

Between 2011 and 2015, Fang's activities brought her into contact with many of the Bay Area’s most prominent politicos.

She volunteered for Ro Khanna's unsuccessful 2014 House bid, according to a former campus organizer and social media posts. (Khanna, a Democrat, was elected to the House in 2016.) Khanna's office said he remembers seeing Fang at several Indian American political gatherings but did not have further contact with her. Khanna's office said the FBI did not brief him on her activities. Khanna's 2014 campaign staff said that Fang's name does not appear in their staff records, though they said that their records do not include all volunteers.

Fang helped with a fundraiser for Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) in 2013, according to a flyer from the event Fang shared on Facebook. She appeared in photos over multiple years with a host of California politicians, including Khanna, Swalwell, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) and then-Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.).

Gabbard ""has no recollection of ever meeting or talking with her, nor any recollection of her playing a major role at the fundraiser,"" a spokesperson said in an email to Axios.

Fremont City Councilmember Raj Salwan, whose name appears on the flyer, told Axios he was unaware of Fang's role in the event and her name was added to the flyer by other Asian American leaders.

Chu’s office said they have no records of Christine Fang. Honda said he had no memory of meeting Fang.

The bottom line: U.S. officials believe Fang's real reason for being in the U.S was to gather political intelligence and to influence rising U.S. officials on China-related issues.

Close relationships between a U.S. elected official and a covert Chinese intelligence operative can provide the Chinese government with opportunities to sway the opinion of key decision-makers.

Beijing may aim to influence foreign policy issues directly related to China, or issues closer to home, such as partnering with Chinese companies for local investment — an issue particularly salient among local-level officials such as mayors and city council members.

Sounding the alarm: The U.S. response

Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios

U.S. counterintelligence officials said they believe Fang acted at the direction of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), the country’s main civilian spy agency.

U.S. officials first noticed Fang through surveillance they were conducting on a different person — a suspected MSS officer working undercover as a diplomat in the San Francisco consulate, a current U.S. counterintelligence official said.

The suspected officer used the consulate as a base to do outreach to state and local-level U.S. politicians, including inviting them on trips to China, the official said.

The official added that both Fang and the suspected officer were focused on gathering political intelligence and conducting influence operations in the Bay Area. (Axios corroborated through U.S. State Department records that a Chinese diplomat with the same name as the suspected MSS officer was stationed in San Francisco during the period Fang was there.)

Fang and the suspected officer met or spoke on numerous occasions, leading U.S. officials to look into Fang’s own background and activities, the official said.

However, Fang's main intelligence handlers were believed to be based in China, according to two U.S. officials.

Fang was put under FBI surveillance, four current and former U.S. officials said. The FBI's San Francisco Division led a counterintelligence investigation into Fang's activities, according to one current and one former U.S. intelligence official.

""The fact that she was traveling around the country"" getting close to U.S. politicians ""was a big red flag,"" said one of the officials. ""She was on a mission.""

What happened next: Senior U.S. intelligence officials provided multiple defensive briefings around 2015 to warn targeted local and national politicians about Fang's connections to Chinese intelligence and potential Chinese assets in their offices, one of these officials said.

U.S. intelligence officials also provided multiple briefings to White House officials and members of Congress on the case, a current senior official said.

Bill Harrison, the mayor of Fremont, California, at that time, said he knew Fang because she volunteered in his office and participated in numerous local political and community events. Harrison told Axios that in August 2015 he was contacted by FBI officials who warned him about Fang’s suspected activities in the Bay Area.

Bureau officials said Fang’s activities were part of a ""long game play"" targeting local politicians, Harrison recalled. The FBI told him the Chinese government’s strategy is ""to strike up a relationship with you and see if you move up the line,"" Harrison said.

How it ended: Fang left the U.S. suddenly

Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios

U.S. officials said China’s intelligence operation broke up in mid-2015 when Fang left the U.S. amid the FBI-led probe.

Fang had planned to travel to Washington, D.C., to attend a June 2015 event.

But shortly beforehand, she said she could no longer attend because she unexpectedly needed to return to China, according to an acquaintance from California on the same trip, who spoke with Axios.

Many of Fang's political contacts in the Bay Area were surprised and confused about her sudden departure from the country.

""When she left kind of abruptly, we all kind of scratched our heads,"" recalled Harrison, the former Fremont mayor. (The FBI reached out to Harrison after Fang’s departure.)

""She disappeared off the face of everything,"" remembered Gilbert Wong, the former mayor of Cupertino, California, who had seen Fang frequently at political events.

But in the months surrounding her departure, rumors swirled in Bay Area political circles that the FBI was investigating her, according to four local organizers, political operatives, and elected officials who knew her.

Fang has not returned to the U.S., said intelligence officials and her former political acquaintances. She appears to have largely cut off contact with her U.S.-based friends and the networks she spent years building in California.

The Justice Department has filed no public charges against Fang.

Why Beijing targets California's Bay Area

Data: FEC; Map: Andrew Witherspoon/Axios

The Bay Area offers ideal conditions for a foreign intelligence operative aiming to identify and target ambitious local politicians with national aspirations.

The big picture: Some of America’s most powerful politicians got their start in Bay Area politics, and China recognizes California’s importance. The MSS has a unit dedicated solely to political intelligence and influence operations in California.

Silicon Valley is also the world’s most important center for the technology industry, making it a hotbed for Chinese economic espionage. Russian intelligence has also long targeted the Bay Area.

California's economy is the largest of all the U.S. states, giving California state lawmakers significant influence over national trends.

Democrats dominate the Bay Area, from mayors to its numerous U.S. congressional districts, and anyone seeking proximity to power needs to be in their political circles.

Context: The FBI’s extensive surveillance of left-wing political groups in the 1960s and 1970s has created a lingering distrust of the bureau that still exists today in Bay Area politics.

The Bay Area has one of the largest and oldest Chinese American communities in the country. Keeping tabs on Chinese diaspora communities is a top priority of China’s intelligence services, U.S. officials said.

China's spy services want to influence these communities to become more predisposed to the regime, as well as surveil and stamp out potential organized opposition to the Communist Party.

Access to local political offices can give Beijing’s intelligence operatives opportunities to collect information on communities of Chinese descent in the United States.

A high-profile example of this occurred in the 2000s, when China’s Ministry of State Security allegedly recruited a San Francisco-based staffer in Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office. This person, who was fired when the FBI alerted Feinstein to his activities, was responsible for liaising with the local Chinese community.

What’s at stake: Chinese Americans find themselves in a difficult position in 2020, being squeezed both by influence campaigns from the Chinese government and a rise in anti-Chinese racism in the United States.

""We want to fight against racism, we want to call it out,"" Wong, the former mayor of Cupertino, told Axios. ""But if there’s a spy, we definitely support full prosecution and we don’t support China penetrating the Chinese community.""

""How do we address this issue without infringing on Chinese American rights?"" he added.

Khanna said in a statement: ""I respect the need for law enforcement to protect our nation from espionage. [But] we need strict guardrails to make sure the FBI’s investigations do not have collateral damage to the privacy of American citizens or to the legitimacy of Asian Americans in this country.” He underscored his concern about ""the chilling effect"" of overbroad surveillance on Chinese American political participation.

How Fang rose to prominence among Bay Area politicos

In 2011, Fang enrolled as a student at California State University East Bay, where she served as the president of the school's Chinese Student Association and president of the campus chapter of Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs (APAPA), a national organization that encourages Asian Americans to get involved in civic affairs.

She used those positions as her initial platform to gain access to political circles. She frequently invited political figures, business executives, and Chinese consular officials to attend the flurry of high-profile events she organized over a period of several years, according to current and former local officials, former students, Bay Area politicos, and social media activity.

Fang's first known contact with numerous politicians, including Swalwell, Harrison, Chu, and then-candidate Khanna was through her role as president of these organizations.

Fang received a campus pride award for the work she did on behalf of the Chinese Student Association during the 2012–2013 academic year.

During this time, Fang maintained unusually close ties to the Chinese consulate in San Francisco.

It's common for Chinese student association presidents to communicate frequently with Chinese consular officials.

But Fang's relationship to the San Francisco consulate was especially close, according to social media posts, event flyers, photographs, and one current U.S. intelligence official.

As Fang branched out into off-campus politics, she relied heavily on her APAPA affiliation. Many of Fang's activities were ""under the auspices of APAPA,"" said one Bay Area political operative, an observation echoed by five other Bay Area political figures and activists.

Henry Yin, who is president of the APAPA Bay Area region chapter, told Axios in a phone call that he had seen Fang at numerous events and remembered her as being “very active.”

APAPA is “not involved with foreign countries,” said Yin, adding that the organization tries ""to make connections with concerned citizens for the betterment of Asian and Pacific Islanders, and also benefit all citizens at large.""

Fang soon became a mainstay at Bay Area political events, fundraising for candidates and bringing along donors.

""She was everywhere,"" said Raj Salwan, a current Fremont City councilmember, expressing a sentiment echoed by several other current and former local officials who spoke to Axios. ""She was an active student. I was surprised at how active she was and how she knew so many politicos.""

Fang’s Facebook friends list is a virtual who's who of local Bay Area politicos, and includes city council members, current and former mayors, Khanna, and Swalwell’s father and brother.

She positioned herself ""to be the connector between the Asian American community and members of Congress,"" recalled a Bay Area political operative who knew her.

One photo, taken at a March 2014 event at the Chinese Embassy in D.C., shows Fang together with Honda and Ash Kalra — at the time a San Jose city councilmember, later elected to the California State Assembly in 2016. A representative of Kalra’s office said he does not remember meeting Fang.

Fang attended events in support of former San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, according to an acquaintance present at the gatherings. (Lee, who began serving as mayor in 2011, passed away in 2017 while in office.)

What they're saying: Several acquaintances in political circles told Axios that Fang was ""charismatic"" and ""well liked"" — though others described her behavior as ""secretive"" and even ""suspicious.""

""Christine was a political player and she was someone who was good to know,"" said a former campus political organizer who knew her.

But others found her less substantive. “She never really, to me, was interested on the policy side,” recalled the Bay Area political operative.

Few seemed to know Fang on a personal level. Several acquaintances told Axios she seemed to come from wealth — she drove a white Mercedes, according to one official — but said she never spoke about her family or her hometown.

Fang's connection to Swalwell

Fang's ties to Rep. Eric Swalwell, which began when he was a councilmember for Dublin City, California, demonstrate China’s long game.

Swalwell rose to prominence rapidly, and in late 2012 became one of the youngest members of the U.S. House.

In January 2015, Swalwell was assigned a seat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, serving as the lead Democrat on the subcommittee on CIA oversight.

Details: Fang’s earliest known engagement with Swalwell occurred through the Chinese Student Association. By 2014, she had risen in local political circles and developed close ties to Swalwell’s office.

Fang ""was a bundler"" for Swalwell and other candidates, according to a Bay Area political operative with direct knowledge of her efforts. A current U.S. intelligence official confirmed her activity for Swalwell; a local elected official also said she brought in donors for other candidates. Bundlers persuade others to write checks for campaigns; they can bring in substantial sums of money as well as deepen the campaign’s engagement with target communities, making bundlers a valuable and thus potentially influential ally to a candidate.

The Bay Area political operative who witnessed Fang fundraising on Swalwell’s behalf was concerned whether donors she brought in were legally permitted to donate. They found no evidence of illegal contributions.

Fang facilitated the potential assignment of interns into Swalwell’s offices, the political operative said. In at least one case, an intern recommended by Fang was placed into Swalwell’s D.C. office, this person said. A current U.S. intelligence official confirmed the intern placement.

For Fang, targeting Swalwell made sense. His 2012 campaign — which was something of a longshot bid, pitting a young and relatively inexperienced city official against a longtime incumbent from the same party — relied heavily on Asian American support, said a former congressional staffer from the East Bay.

That made Swalwell's ties to the Chinese American community, and particularly APAPA, the Asian American civic organization, especially important.

Fang sought out mayors around the U.S.

Fang attended conferences for mayors around the U.S., according to three U.S. intelligence officials, as well as numerous current and former politicians who knew her.

Why it matters: By attending conferences for local officials, Fang went to extraordinary lengths to meet and befriend U.S. politicians, ostensibly as part of her activities as a Chinese agent, U.S. officials believe.

Details: Fang engaged in sexual or romantic relationships with at least two mayors of Midwestern cities, said one U.S. intelligence official and one former elected official.

At a 2014 conference in Washington, an older Midwestern mayor ""from an obscure city"" referred to Fang as his ""girlfriend"" and insisted the relationship was genuine despite the clear age difference between Fang and himself, according to former Cupertino Mayor Gilbert Wong, who was directly present for the conversation.

Fang also had a sexual encounter with an Ohio mayor in a car that was under electronic FBI surveillance, said one current U.S. official. When the mayor asked why Fang was interested in him, Fang told him she wanted to improve her English, the same official said.

What they're saying: Wong told Axios he knew Fang from her political activities in California, where she would attend fundraisers and Chinese cultural events.

But Wong said he was ""shocked"" to see her appear at an event for U.S. municipal officials hosted by the Chinese Embassy in D.C. in March 2014. Wong told Axios he had gone to D.C. twice that year to attend mayor-focused events, and that he saw Fang at both of those events.

At the Chinese Embassy event, Fang introduced Wong to the mayor of Shenzhen, a city that, like Cupertino, is home to a major tech industry. She translated so that the two mayors could have a conversation.



The bottom line

U.S. intelligence officials believe China's spy services have become more aggressive and emboldened, including in their U.S.-focused influence and political intelligence-gathering operations. Fang's case shows how a single determined individual, allegedly working for Beijing, can gain access to sensitive U.S. political circles.

Now Who’s Contesting Elections? The Democratic House could overturn results in Iowa and New York. Opinion,0,k8gt3e,https://www.wsj.com/articles/now-whos-contesting-elections-11607124449,6,1607377290.0,,"Donald Trump’s campaign against the 2020 Presidential outcome undermines political legitimacy, but no side is blameless in America’s partisan election escalation. Witness the new Democratic effort to overturn the election result in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District—which could be emulated in New York’s 22nd if Republicans win there too.

Iowa’s state elections board on Monday certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’s victory in the 2nd district, flipping a seat currently held by a Democrat. But her opponent, Rita Hart, is dusting off a 1969 federal statute to have the House of Representatives pick the winner. That means Democrats in Washington could overrule Iowa voters to seat a co-partisan and grow their majority.

The Iowa race was decided by six votes. The counting went on for weeks as 24 counties canvassed and recanvassed over 390,000 ballots, and lawyers from both sides haggled with election officials over machine counting, ballot qualifications and voter intent.

Normally this exhaustive process would end matters. Not this year. Ms. Hart’s campaign said it will bypass an Iowa court appeal and ask the Committee on House Administration to intervene. The House has final say on its Members’ elections and the Supreme Court has held that courts can’t intervene in those decisions under the Constitution’s Article I.

That means the count in Iowa’s 2nd District will become a political fight rather than a legal one. House Democrats in 1985 took advantage of the same process to reverse Indiana’s state certification of a Republican winner in a Congressional race. They refused to seat either candidate in January, and in May declared the Democrat the winner after their recount excluded 32 absentee votes."

In a year defined by a devastating pandemic, the world lost iconic defenders of civil rights, great athletes and entertainers who helped define their genres.

Many of their names hold a prominent place in the collective consciousness — RBG, Kobe, Maradona, Eddie Van Halen, Little Richard, Sean Connery, Alex Trebek, Christo — but pandemic restrictions often limited the public’s ability to mourn their loss in a year that saw more than a million people die from the coronavirus.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — known as the Notorious RBG to her many admirers — was one of the many noteworthy figures who died in 2020.

In a court known for solemn legal proceedings, Ginsburg became a cultural and social media icon whose fierce defense of women’s rights earned her a devoted following. She died in September after 27 years on the country’s highest court. Making few concessions to age and health problems, she showed a steely resilience and became the leader of liberal justices on the court.

The world also said goodbye to U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a lion of the civil rights movement who died in July.

Other former political figures who died this year include Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, New York Mayor David Dinkins, Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and FBI Director William S. Sessions.

Some of the year’s deaths struck down relatively young people, leaving mourners with the heartbreak of a life gone too soon.

Basketball great Kobe Bryant died along with several others in a January helicopter crash at age 41. And in a shock to fans, actor Chadwick Boseman, who inspired audiences with his portrayal of comic book superhero Black Panther, died of cancer in August at age 43.

Others in the world of arts and entertainment who died in 2020 include actors Olivia de Havilland, Kirk Douglas, Irrfan Khan, Max von Sydow, Diana Rigg, Ian Holm, Rishi Kapoor and Franca Valeri; musicians Ellis Marsalis Jr., John Prine, Bonnie Pointer, Kenny Rogers, Juliette Greco and Toots Hibbert; filmmakers Nobuhiko Obayashi, Joel Schumacher and Ivan Passer; authors Mary Higgins Clark and Clive Cussler; TV hosts Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer; magician Roy Horn; and fashion designer Kenzo Takada.

Anti-Vaccine Doctor Has Been Invited to Testify Before Senate Committee,205,k87tcm,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/06/us/politics/anti-vax-scientist-senate-hearing.html,77,1607337372.0,,"WASHINGTON — A doctor who is skeptical of coronavirus vaccines and promotes the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment will be the lead witness at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday, prompting criticism from Democrats who say Republicans should not give a platform to someone who spreads conspiracy theories.

Dr. Jane M. Orient is the executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group that opposes government involvement in medicine and views federal vaccine mandates as a violation of human rights.

“A public health threat is the rationale for the policy on mandatory vaccines. But how much of a threat is required to justify forcing people to accept government-imposed risks?” Dr. Orient wrote in a statement to the Senate last year, calling vaccine mandates “a serious intrusion into individual liberty, autonomy and parental decisions.”

In a phone interview on Sunday, Dr. Orient, an internist who received her medical degree from Columbia University in New York, resisted being cast as an “anti-vaxxer” and said she would not get a coronavirus vaccine because she had an autoimmune condition. She added that she opposed the government’s push for all Americans to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, noting that both vaccine candidates — one made by the Pfizer and the other by Moderna — use a new scientific method."
"Rudy Giuliani tested positive for coronavirus, Trump says",81,k81tte,https://reut.rs/2LcXXtQ,3,1607316758.0,,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has tested positive for COVID-19, Trump said on Sunday, prompting one state legislature to close for a week after Giuliani visited to try to persuade lawmakers to help reverse Trump’s election defeat.

The 76-year-old former New York mayor is the latest in a long string of people close to the White House, including Trump himself, sickened in a pandemic that has killed more than 280,000 Americans.

“@RudyGiuliani, by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, and who has been working tirelessly exposing the most corrupt election (by far!) in the history of the USA, has tested positive for the China Virus,” Trump said, using a term for COVID-19 that has drawn backlash.

Giuliani tweeted his thanks to “friends and followers” Sunday evening for their concern about him. “I’m getting great care and feeling good. Recovering quickly and keeping up with everything,” he wrote on Twitter.

Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that Giuliani was at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., on Sunday and one said he had been admitted for treatment. The hospital did not immediately respond to requests for confirmation.

Giuliani has been spearheading Trump’s floundering effort to overturn his Nov. 3 election loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden through a flurry of lawsuits. Both Trump and Giuliani have repeatedly claimed, contrary to evidence, that the outcome was marred by widespread fraud.

State and federal officials have repeatedly said there is no evidence of fraud on any significant scale.

Giuliani visited Georgia on Thursday, where he urged state lawmakers to intervene to overturn Biden’s victory in the state, after making similar pleas in Michigan on Wednesday and Arizona on Monday.

After news of Giuliani’s test, the Arizona state legislature said it would close both chambers this week out of caution “for recent cases and concerns relating to COVID-19.” Giuliani met with about a dozen Republican lawmakers there last week.

The Trump campaign released a statement from the president’s legal team Sunday evening saying Giuliani had tested negative just before his trip to the three states.

“Mayor Giuliani tested negative twice immediately preceding his trip to Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia. The Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 until more than 48 hours after his return,” the statement said. “No legislators in any state or members of the press are on the contact tracing list, under current CDC (Centers for Disease Control) Guidelines.”

It said other members of the president’s legal team “who are defined as having had close contact” will follow their doctors’ orders and CDC guidelines about self-isolation and testing.

Trump and many of his close associates have balked at public health officials’ advice to wear masks and avoid crowds to stem transmission of the respiratory illness, which has roared to record levels in the United States as winter approaches.

Giuliani, who developed an international profile as “America’s Mayor” for his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has faced mounting legal troubles during the Trump administration.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been investigating Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine, and two associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, have been charged with campaign finance violations.

Giuliani has not been criminally charged and has denied wrongdoing. Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty."
U.S. Appeals Court rejects bid to block Georgia win for Biden,240,k7gvbx,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-lawsuit-georgia/u-s-appeals-court-rejects-bid-to-block-georgia-win-for-biden-idUSKBN28F0MS?il=0,23,1607234922.0,,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Saturday rejected a bid by a conservative lawyer to block President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia and left in place procedures that will make it easier for voters to cast absentee ballots in January when two Senate seats are up for grabs.

U.S. District Judge Steven Grimberg, who was nominated by Trump, rejected attorney L. Lin Wood’s arguments and found in a Nov. 20 opinion that the lawyer had no standing to sue.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta agreed with the lower court, saying Wood had failed “to allege a particularized injury” and the request was moot anyway since Georgia had already certified the election.

“We may not entertain post-election contests about garden-variety issues of vote counting and misconduct that may properly be filed in state courts,” the appeals court said in its ruling.

The ruling also means Georgia officials will be required to notify absentee voters so they can fix problems with their ballot in the upcoming U.S. Senate election.

On Jan. 5, Georgia holds a run-off election for its two U.S. Senate seats, which will determine whether Republicans or Democrats control the chamber.

Wood was seeking to overturn a lower court judge who refused to block Georgia officials from certifying the state’s election for Biden.

The appeals court ruling was decided by a panel of three judges, two of whom had once been under consideration by U.S. President Donald Trump for U.S. Supreme Court seats.

It is yet another setback for supporters of Trump in their long-shot bid to reverse Biden victories. They have suffered court losses in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All of these states have already certified their election results.

Wood’s lawsuit claimed that Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger violated state law in March when he struck an agreement with the Democratic Party to settle a lawsuit over 8,157 ballots that were thrown out in the 2018 general election.

Under the settlement, officials added layers of review before rejecting signatures on absentee ballots and were required to notify voters of absentee ballot defects."
Report Points to Microwave ‘Attack’ as Likely Source of Mystery Illnesses That Hit Diplomats and Spies,6,k7drfx,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/business/economy/havana-syndrome-microwave-attack.html,5,1607224794.0,,"But since 2018, the U.S. government has declined to speculate publicly on the cases, and some scientists have promoted alternate theories, like a kind of psychological illness that spread in the stressful environment of foreign missions.

Amid the controversy and confusion, some of the afflicted officers have complained that the United States has failed to support them. In several cases, the government initially refused to grant leave and provide the necessary medical care, the officers said. And with the government silent on the possibility of a foreign attack, many of the victims were left feeling that the public believed they had made it all up.

Several of the victims have accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Trump administration officials of downplaying the issue in an attempt to avoid disrupting international ties. They now ask how President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his nominee for secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, will respond, especially given the new scientific findings.

After lawmakers pressured the State Department for months to release the report, the agency gave it to some congressional officials and others on Thursday and Friday, asking them not to share it. The Times and NBC News separately obtained the report on Friday, and NBC earlier reported the findings. The National Academies publicly released the report Saturday evening.

“We are pleased this report is now out and can add to the data and analyses that may help us come to an eventual conclusion as to what transpired,” the State Department said in a statement on Saturday.

The department also said that “each possible cause remains speculative” and that various factors, including the committee’s lack of access to some information because of potential security concerns, “limit the scope of the report,” though “they do not lessen its value.”

For the Trump administration, acknowledging that the incidents were the result of a foreign attack could have necessitated evacuating American missions in China, disrupting an important economic relationship. The administration did take a harder approach in Cuba, which aligned with its larger goal of reversing President Barack Obama’s diplomatic opening with Havana."
"Presidential pardon investigation involves Kushner lawyer and GOP lobbyist, sources say",314,k79bt1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/04/politics/bribe-pardon-lowell-broidy/index.html,6,1607210772.0,,"(CNN) The Justice Department bribery-for-a-presidential-pardon investigation, which became public this week , involves the past efforts of well-connected Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell and Republican lobbyist and fundraiser Elliott Broidy in the early days of the Trump White House, sources tell CNN.

The effort in 2017 -- which appears to have begun before Lowell became a lawyer to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and Broidy took part in lobbying the Trump administration for foreign interests -- was on behalf of Hugh Leslie Baras, a septuagenarian psychologist convicted in 2014 of failing to report income from his private practice to the IRS. Baras unsuccessfully tried to overturn his sentence for years.

No known charges have been brought as a result of the investigation, and it is not clear if the probe is active. People ""have not been charged by the grand jury,"" the Justice Department told a federal judge recently. A department official told CNN earlier this week that ""no government official was or is currently a subject or target of the investigation disclosed in this filing."" Baras has not received a pardon or a reduced sentence.

Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court released court documents on Tuesday related to the investigation with heavy redactions, though her opinion mentioned emails provided by the Justice Department that appeared to promise an ""anticipated future substantial political contribution"" in exchange for clemency, with political connections to the Trump White House key to the strategy.

Broidy pleaded guilty this fall to a foreign lobbying conspiracy , in which he took part in an effort to convince the Trump administration to stop a fraud investigation of a Malaysian investment fund and advocated for the removal of a Chinese billionaire in the US. He also agreed to cooperate, according to his plea deal.

Lowell is known in Washington as a star trial lawyer, and represents an associate of Broidy's who also pleaded guilty to a foreign lobbying charge in August. Lowell has served as white collar defense lawyer to President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Kushner, both presidential advisers, a role he took on in June 2017, apparently at the tail end of, or after his efforts for Baras.

None of the people who acknowledge they were involved in seeking a pardon for Baras, and that the judge's opinion pertained to their efforts, have heard anything from investigators. Representatives of Broidy, Lowell and Baras say they believe they aren't under investigation.

""Mr. Broidy is not under investigation,"" said William Burck, an attorney for Broidy. ""Mr. Broidy is not accused of any wrongdoing.""

Burck said that Broidy, a Beverly Hills-based GOP fundraiser who raised money for Trump's inauguration, acted as a connector in the situation, helping Sanford Diller, a billionaire California real estate developer and Trump donor, connect to Lowell as a way to help Baras in prison. Diller died in 2018. He had given more than $300,000 to the Republican Party in 2016, according to federal records.

The court record about the investigation shows that a ""substantial"" political donor expected to help secure clemency for an imprisoned defendant because of his contributions, and had enlisted the help of an ""attorney-advocate"" and of a person ""coordinating"" to get a clemency petition to the White House.

Marc Zilversmit, a San Francisco-based attorney who represented Baras in his trial and appeal, said the Justice Department hasn't contacted him or Baras about the investigation. Baras was released from prison in August 2019, after serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence.

""They haven't shown any interest in talking to him, and they've never suggested he did anything wrong,"" Zilversmit said.

Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Lowell, told CNN that he spoke to the Justice Department this week after the opinion was unsealed, and was left with the impression that ""no one had the slightest problem with [Lowell's] conduct."" Lowell had acted simply as a lawyer for Baras, Weingarten said, adding that no bribe was paid, he said. Lowell had represented Baras in his effort to secure a pardon -- which normally includes submitting an application to the administration.

""They have sympathy for him. He's never been, is not or will be under scrutiny in this matter by them,"" Weingarten said. ""But everything's under seal.""

Documents reviewed by CNN about Baras also indicated Lowell was the point person to reach out to the incoming Trump administration, and was brought into the effort by Diller and Broidy. The documents indicate that Lowell reached out to the White House counsel's office and connected Diller to people there."
House Passes Landmark Bill Decriminalizing Marijuana,24,k71eyq,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/us/politics/house-marijuana.html,8,1607172937.0,,"“The effects of marijuana prohibition have been particularly felt by communities of color because it has meant that people from the communities couldn’t get jobs,” Representative Jerry Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview.

Mr. Nadler, who spearheaded the legislation with Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California and the vice president-elect, described the collateral consequences of a conviction for marijuana possession as creating “an often-permanent second-class status for millions of Americans.”

The idea behind the legislation is “you want to make whole these communities, and you want to compensate,” he said. “You want to shed light on what was done.”

The legislation intends to give states power and incentives to enact their own reforms, and its passage came as states around the country, including some conservative-leaning ones, have become increasingly open to decriminalizing marijuana amid a growing consensus that the war on drugs has been destructive. Fifteen states have legalized recreational cannabis, and voters in five states last month voted on legalization issues, bringing the number of states where medical marijuana is legal to 35.

The law would require federal courts to release those serving sentences for nonviolent, marijuana-related offenses, and set up grant programs focused on providing job training, legal aid and substance use treatment, as well as grants for small businesses in the marijuana industry led by low-income and minority business owners. Physicians with the Department of Veterans Affairs would also be allowed for the first time to recommend medical marijuana to their patients."

Native Americans Helped Flip Arizona. Can They Mobilize in Georgia?,6,k6s22m,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/us/politics/georgia-native-american-voters.html,4,1607140077.0,,"“No one has ever taken the time to really reach out to the individuals themselves and say, ‘These are the list of reasons why you need to register to vote and cast your ballot, because this is something that affects you,’” said Tara Benally, field director for the Rural Arizona Project and a Navajo citizen. “Building that relationship with the people, it’s what the federal government needs to do. They’ve never actually done that with the Indigenous nations.”

The Rural Arizona Project, a nonprofit that mobilizes voters in rural areas, had seven to 10 field organizers this year and worked with 200 Indigenous artists and influencers to promote a voter registration tool designed for communities without traditional street addresses. Native Americans are often disenfranchised when clerks mistakenly register them in the wrong precinct, but the tool lets voters enter plus codes — essentially shortened coordinates — to identify their locations more precisely.

Ms. Benally’s team contacted thousands of Navajo and Hopi voters, held drive-through events to register voters safely during the pandemic, and ultimately registered more than 4,500, the group’s executive director, TJ Ellerbeck, said.

A separate effort by Four Directions — led by Mr. Semans’s daughter, Donna Semans, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe — registered about 2,000 Navajo voters. VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan group focused on low-propensity voters, sent more than 400,000 texts, according to its chief of staff, Jordan James Harvill, a Cherokee and Choctaw citizen. Advocacy groups also reached out to postal workers, who agreed to drive mail-in ballots straight to their destination to avoid the circuitous route that mail from the Navajo Nation often takes.

Native Americans were also influential in Wisconsin, where Mr. Biden won by about 20,000 votes. The state’s most Democratic area, where Mr. Biden received 82 percent of the vote, was Menominee County, which is near Green Bay and is home to the Menominee Tribe. Ashland and Bayfield Counties, which have significant Native American populations, were blue spots in a sea of red in northern Wisconsin.

Native turnout was substantial, and heavily Democratic, even in states where the race wasn’t close, like North and South Dakota (which Mr. Trump won) and Minnesota (which Mr. Biden won). Four Directions registered more than 8,000 voters in Minnesota."
Covid-19 vaccines face a varied and powerful misinformation movement online,40,k6raro,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/covid-19-vaccines-face-varied-powerful-misinformation-movement-online-n1249378,3,1607137712.0,,"Vaccination proponents and misinformation researchers had been waiting for years for Facebook to take action against the biggest and most influential anti-vaccination pages.

So it was with some trepidation that they welcomed the news that the social network last week had banned some of the most popular and prolific anti-vaccination accounts — pages that had also pushed Covid-19 vaccination misinformation to millions of people.

Their impact, however, lives on. While researchers of extremism and public health advocates see the removal of the largest anti-vaccination accounts as mostly positive, new research shows the bigger threat to public trust in a Covid-19 vaccine comes from smaller, better-connected Facebook groups that gravitated to anti-vaccination messaging in recent months.

“What we’re seeing play out with Covid is what was already in the system,"" Neil Johnson, a physicist at George Washington University who studies online extremism, said. ""It was primed for that at the end of 2019.”

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

With many Covid-19 vaccines in the works, health officials have warned that public adoption will be crucial to ensure that enough of the population is immunized to stop the spread of the virus. Experts say there isn't an exact threshold for the percentage of people that need to get vaccinated to stop the virus' spread, but it is expected to be at least 60 percent of the population.

But public sentiment about the vaccines is mixed. Only 42 percent of Americans said “yes” to whether they’d get a Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available, according to a YouGov poll released in August. A poll from the Pew Research Center published in September found a significant decline from May to September in people who said they would get the vaccine if it were immediately available.

Johnson and a team of researchers published a paper in Nature in May that suggested the anti-vaccination movement bore a big responsibility for such hesitancy. It showed that although membership in online anti-vaccination groups was smaller than in pro-vaccination groups, there were more of them, their messages were more diverse, emotive and often persuading, and they were better at spreading those messages outside their groups, meaning they were able to reach more people.

Research from a forthcoming paper from Johnson and his team, currently in review for publication, shows members of communities previously considered unrelated or “undecided” on vaccines — groups for pet lovers, parent school groups, yoga fans and foodies, for instance — are increasingly connecting with the anti-vaccination movement.

“It’s like a tumor growth,” Johnson said.

While the anti-vaccination activists’ favored platform, Facebook, has taken a number of steps recently to limit the reach of anti-vaccine content, the movement has thrived during the pandemic — a success largely due to a pivot toward Covid-19 misinformation and a communication strategy that’s allowed the anti-vaccination message to circumvent platforms’ policy enforcement and reach users outside its network.

Facebook spokesperson Andrea Vallone said in an emailed statement that the company has worked to connect people with accurate information about vaccines and banned misleading ads.

""We also continue to remove misinformation about COVID-19 that could lead to imminent physical harm and direct people to our COVID information Center, which is available in 189 countries,"" she said.

A report by the London-based nonprofit organization Center for Countering Digital Hate found that the anti-vaccination movement gained about 8 million followers since 2019. Conspiracy theories about a coming Covid-19 vaccine have flooded social media, particularly on Instagram and Facebook, according to a new report from First Draft, a global nonprofit organization that researches online misinformation.

Such conspiracy theories (which purported the vaccine to be a clever cover for various forms of population control by a government “deep state,” private philanthropists or even Satan) weren’t limited to anti-vaccine fringe groups, First Draft reported, but were resonating with outside networks. Disparate communities including Libertarian, New Age, QAnon and anti-government groups, as well as more mainstream communities, seem to be uniting around the opposition to a coming Covid-19 vaccine.

The biggest pages banned by Facebook had already been preparing for a crackdown.

Facebook removed the page for the online anti-vaccination show The HighWire this month for violating policies on ""misinformation that could cause physical harm,"" the company said. YouTube had removed the show’s channel in July after reports that host Del Bigtree was downplaying the severity of the coronavirus pandemic on his show and suggesting viewers intentionally expose themselves to Covid-19.

According to a post on the Facebook page for Bigtree’s nonprofit organization, Informed Consent Action Network, The HighWire had published more than 500 videos that attracted more than 30 million views. The page had 360,500 followers when it was deleted.

A HighWire account remains active on Facebook-owned Instagram, where it has 199,000 followers. Bigtree did not return a request for comment.

But it wasn’t vaccine misinformation that got social media’s most popular and prolific anti-vaccination activist banned from Facebook this month. In the end, after years of building an audience on Facebook, Larry Cook, a California social media marketer, and his 200,000-member private group, Stop Mandatory Vaccination, were removed for violating the platform’s policies against promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.

Cook, who did not respond to a request for comment, had been warning his fans of a coming ban and promoting his accounts on 11 other alternative platforms for months.

Cook’s and Bigtree’s pages and groups had continued to grow on Facebook despite a move in March 2019 to diminish the reach of anti-vaccine content during a measles outbreak and subsequent measures during the pandemic to downrank health misinformation in reaction to the World Health Organization’s warnings against “conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response.”

Researchers have observed that livestreaming features provided a way for anti-vaccine activists to continue to reach their audience. Covid-19 in particular also led to significant followings for prominent anti-vaccine figures, said Renee DiResta, who studies disinformation as the research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory.

“The anti-vaccine movement recognized that [Covid-19] was an opportunity to create content, so when people were searching for it, they would find anti-vaccine content,” she said. “They saw this as an opportunity not only to erode confidence in the Covid vaccine, but also to make people hesitant about routine childhood immunizations, as well.”

But efforts to move beyond Facebook have had limited success.

Their audience “may not know where to go and how to navigate to those platforms,” said Kolina Koltai, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, who studies the anti-vaccine movement.

Despite the promotion, only a handful of users have followed Cook and Bigtree to those new platforms.

“Too many people are deeply invested into Facebook, which has the distinct advantage because that is the platform people are on, it is easy to navigate, and it is how users stay connected to friends and families,"" Koltai said.

And users need not switch platforms to maintain the link to the greater anti-vaccination movement. An unknowable number of private groups remain, spaces that have been hubs for misinformation regarding Covid-19 and vaccines. These include the 224,000-member Vaccination Re-education Discussion Forum, a private anti-vaccination group exclusively focused on Covid-19 vaccines.

“It's like an insurgency,” Johnson said. “And the hard thing about battling an insurgency is we never quite knew where they were. There was almost like an invisible network behind them. Often, the groups that were most prominent, the ones coming to your attention because they were the biggest, didn't necessarily mean that they were the important ones in the network.""

His new research shows the anti-vaccination movement has effectively used the pandemic to reach more than 100 million susceptible Facebook users, and seems to be winning the battle for hearts and minds.

As such, banning accounts with large followings is unlikely to have much real impact on the larger anti-vaccination movement.

""The anti-vaccination network is all about passing on narratives, passing on stories, supporting each other, just like an insurgency,"" Johnson said. ""And just like an insurgency, it is embedded with the mainstream civilian population as it were. And that is their strength.”"
India's winter of discontent: Farmers rise up against Modi,0,k6ohe2,https://apnews.com/article/new-delhi-india-526d5dae772a03b8c3e57602795a60ac,3,1607129158.0,,"India's winter of discontent: Farmers rise up against Modi

NEW DELHI (AP) — A chilly breeze whirls through New Delhi in the mornings and the sun is partly obscured by toxic haze, a marker of another winter in the Indian capital. But along the city’s borders, this year is visibly and viscerally different.

The perpetually busy arterial highways that connect most northern Indian towns to this city of 29 million people now pulse to the cries of “Inquilab Zindabad” — “Long live the revolution.” Tens and thousands of farmers with distinctive, colorful turbans and long, flowing beards have descended upon the city’s borders, choking highways in giant demonstrations against new farming laws that they say will open them to corporate exploitation.

ADVERTISEMENT

For more than a week, they’ve marched toward the capital on their tractors and trucks like an army, pushing aside concrete police barricades while braving tear gas, batons and water cannons. Now, on the outskirts of New Delhi, they are hunkered down with food and fuel supplies that can last weeks and threatening to besiege the capital if Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government doesn’t meet their demands to abolish the laws.

“Modi wants to sell our lands to corporates,” said one of them, Kaljeet Singh, 31, who traveled from Ludhiana city in Punjab, some 310 kilometers (190 miles) north of New Delhi. “He can’t decide for millions of those who for generations have given their blood and sweat to the land they regard as more precious than their lives.”

At night, the farmers sleep in trailers and under trucks, curling themselves in blankets to brave the winter chill. During the day, they sit huddled in groups in their vehicles, surrounded by mounds of rice, lentils and vegetables that are prepared into meals at hundreds of makeshift soup kitchens, in enormous pots stirred with wooden spoons the size of canoe paddles.

Anmol Singh, 33, who supports his family of six by farming, said the new laws were part of a larger plan to hand over the farmers’ land to big corporations and make them landless.

“Modi wants the poor farmer to die of hunger so that he can fill the stomachs of his rich friends,” he said. “We are here to fight his brutal decrees peacefully.”

He paused, then reconsidered: “Actually, let him and his ministers take us on. We will give them a bloody nose.”

Many of the protesting farmers hail from northern Punjab and Haryana, two of the largest agricultural states in India. An overwhelming majority of them are Sikhs. They fear the laws passed in September will lead the government to stop buying grain at minimum guaranteed prices and result in exploitation by corporations who will push down prices. Many activists and farming experts support their demand for a minimum guaranteed price for their crops.

The new rules will also eliminate agents who act as middlemen between the farmers and the government-regulated wholesale markets. Farmers say agents are a vital cog of the farm economy and their main line of credit, providing quick funds for fuel, fertilizers and even loans in case of family emergencies.

The laws have compounded existing resentment from farmers, who often complain of being ignored by the government in their push for better crop prices, additional loan waivers and irrigation systems to guarantee water during dry spells.

The government has argued the laws bring about necessary reform that will allow farmers to market their produce and boost production through private investment. But farmers say they were never consulted.

With nearly 60% of the Indian population depending on agriculture for their livelihoods, the growing farmer rebellion has rattled Modi’s administration and allies. His leaders have scrambled to contain the protests, which are fast resembling last year’s scenes when a contentious new citizenship law that discriminated against Muslims led to demonstrations that culminated in violence .

Those demonstrations were much bigger in scale, but the farmers’ rumblings are growing fast and gaining widespread support of ordinary citizens who have started joining them in large numbers.

Modi and his allies have tried to allay farmers’ fears about the new laws while dismissing their concerns. Some of his party leaders have called the farmers “misguided” and “anti-national,” a label often given to those who criticize Modi or his policies.

The government is holding talks with the farmers to persuade them to end their protests, but they have dug in their heels.

Farmer Kulwant Singh, 72, said that when he left his home in Haryana for the protests, he gave his wife a garland of flowers for two possible scenarios.

“Either I return victorious and she places it around my neck in celebration, or I die here revolting and the same garland is put on my body when it reaches home,” Singh said.

Such passions run deep among the protesters who have found social, economic and generational barriers tumbling during the demonstrations.

Singh isn’t the only one from his family who traveled to New Delhi for what he called “Qilah Fatehi,” an Urdu term that translates to “laying a siege.” His son and grandson also accompanied him.

“It’s a fight for my generation too,” said Amrinder Singh, 16.

As demonstrations grow, the protesters have also started to drive a political message home.

Not satisfied with Modi’s federal policies, many of which have attracted widescale resentment from his critics and minorities, protesting farmers say it’s time he stops what they call his “dictatorial behavior.”

“India is in a recession. There are hardly any jobs and our country’s secular fabric is in tatters,” said Gurpreet Singh, 26, a biotechnology student who comes from a farming family. “At a time when India needs a healing touch, Modi is coming up with divisive, controversial laws. This is unacceptable and defies our constitutional values.”

Modi’s second term in power since May 2019 has been marked by several convulsions. The economy has tanked, social strife widened, protests have erupted against discriminatory laws and his government has been questioned over its response to the pandemic.

The farmer protests present a new challenge for the government.

The protesters’ desire to stand up to Modi and his policies extends to a sexagenarian farmer couple who drove 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Chandigarh city in a hatchback Sunday to participate in the demonstrations.

Dharam Singh Sandhu, 67, and Vimaljeet Kaur, 66, are spending nights in their car parked near the protest site. In the morning, they share breakfast at a makeshift soup kitchen. The latter part of the day is spent taking part in the demonstrations.

“Our land is our mother. If we can’t protect it then we have no right to live,” Sandhu said about the protests.

His wife spoke passionately of a larger purpose as she made her way to the protest site through a stream of vehicles honking incessantly to get past congested traffic.

“Our country is like a bunch of flowers, but Modi wants it to be of the same color. He has no right to do that. I am here to protest against that mindset,” Kaur said.

As Kaur walked hand in hand with her husband, a great cry emerged from one of the vehicles: “Inquilab Zindabad.”

The crowd turned and followed their gaze toward a young man with a black beard who held up his fist through the car’s window.

The protesters, including Kaur, roared back: “Inquilab Zindabad!”"

Americans who struggled through 2020 could face more hardship in the year ahead as pandemic related payments and protections come to an end.

Expanded unemployment benefits will cease by the end of the year, reducing much-needed income for as many as 12 million Americans. Federal eviction protection will expire as well. And student loan payments, which had been paused since March, are scheduled to resume in January.

Meanwhile, the pandemic shows no signs of abating and broad distribution of any vaccine is likely months away. Both sides in Congress have shown interest a new relief package, they’ve been unable to reach an agreement and time is running short.

Here’s what you should know about the changes ahead and how to cope:

STUDENT LOANS

The U.S. Department of Education suspended payments for federal student loans, stopped collections on defaulted loans and set interest rates at 0% in March. This relief period concludes at the end of the year, unless extended by the government.

Loan servicers are expected to start contacting borrowers in early December about resuming payments, said Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert with the website Savingforcollege.com.

If you don’t hear anything, contact your servicer to find out about the status of your loans.

If a borrower is unemployed or otherwise unable to resume payments, they can seek an economic hardship deferment, unemployment deferment or a forbearance — all of which will result in a further pause in payments. There are also income-driven repayment plans, which base the size of a monthly payment on a percentage of your discretionary income. For those whose income is less than 150% of the poverty line, the monthly loan payment will be zero.

Some private student loan lenders are extending their pandemic related forbearance on a case-by-case basis, Kantrowitz said. In the case of federal or private student loans, he suggests borrowers ask their lender about their options.

EVICTIONS

A moratorium put in place by the Centers for Disease Control in September that protects certain renters from eviction expires at the end of the year.

It only applies to renters who earn less than $99,000, or $198,00 for couples, who are unable to pay rent because of COVID-19 hardships and can affirm they would become homeless if they are evicted.

A patchwork of federal, state and local eviction moratoriums has not kept everyone from being kicked out of their home, however. The Eviction Lab at Princeton University has been tracking evictions in 27 cities and says more than 151,000 evictions have taken place during the pandemic.

ADVERTISEMENT

Experts are expecting a wave of evictions ahead as moratoriums expire and back rent becomes due.

Anyone who is struggling to pay rent, unable to pay or is behind in payments should contact their landlord or property management company to discuss their options. They may be willing to negotiate.

Renters should also find out what local protections they have, if any. Th e Eviction Lab maintains a list of local and regional actions to protect eviction of renters.

If you are on the brink of eviction or already facing action, consider legal help.

The Stanford Legal Design Lab along with Pew Charitable Trusts, has a user-friendly website to inform renters about their rights and options. Just Shelter , a tenant advocacy group, offers information on local and national help for renters in distress. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Low Income Housing Coalition both have information online to assist renters.

Renters can also contact the Department of Housing and Urban Development to see if they qualify for housing assistance or to get help with eviction issues.

UNEMPLOYMENT

Unemployment hit record highs due to the pandemic. And millions of Americans are at risk of running out of benefits when two key federal pandemic relief programs expire.

People who have exhausted their state’s unemployment benefits have been able to seek an additional 13 weeks of payments through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. However, that program expires at the end of the December.

Someone who uses up both of these payments may be able to apply for extended benefits, which states make available during times of high unemployment. All states enabled extended benefits during the pandemic, but some have since ceased them because of an improvement in employment.

Anyone who has exhausted their traditional state benefits should ask their state employment agency if extended benefits are available. A separate application may be required, said Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project.

Additionally, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program — known as the PUA — allows self-employed, part-time workers and others who aren’t typically eligible for unemployment to receive payments. It has enabled millions to get aid but those who have exhausted their PUA payments have no alternative.

The Century Foundation estimates that 12 million people will be on PEUC or PUA when it expires on Dec. 26. The nonpartisan think tank estimates that 2.9 million of those running out of PEUC will be able to collect extended benefits in 2021.

Beyond that, the foundation estimates 4.4 million workers will have already exhausted benefits under the federal virus relief package before this cutoff, sending into the new year with little or no aid.

The economy has improved but the unemployment rate is still 6.9%, below its peak but a far cry from the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5%. And the full impact of a third wave of COVID-19 cases has yet to be seen.

“Sadly, after this cliff, there just isn’t much for people.” said Evermore. “Food pantries, the other frayed components of the safety net, high interest loans like credit cards or pawn shops – people are going to have nowhere to turn in the dead of winter during a pandemic.”

For those in need, United Way’s 211 service can connect people with charitable assistance for housing, food and other essentials. The National Foundation for Consumer Credit Counseling also has free financial counselors available to help those struggling financially."

To that effect, Bush, the 43rd president of the US, was reported to have met with Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx - director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the White House coronavirus response coordinator respectively.

Obama, speaking on Thursday, December 3, said he trusted Fauci's effort in the production of the effective coronavirus vaccine, saying he would definitely take it on camera to boost the public faith. He said:

""People like Anthony Fauci, who I know, and I've worked with, I trust completely. So, if Anthony Fauci tells me this vaccine is safe and can vaccinate, you know, immunize you from getting Covid, absolutely, I'm going to take it.

ATLANTA (AP) — After weathering criticism for certifying President Donald Trump’s narrow election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, Republican officials in Georgia are proposing additional requirements for the state’s vote-by-mail process, despite no evidence of systemic fraud or irregularities.

Two state Senate committees held hearings Thursday to begin a review of Georgia’s voting laws. Republicans are zeroing in on a plan to require a photo ID for ballots cast by mail. Voting rights activists and Democrats argue that the change isn’t necessary and would disenfranchise voters.

Biden beat Trump by just over 12,500 votes in Georgia, with Biden receiving nearly twice as many of the record number of absentee ballots as the Republican president, according to the secretary of state’s office. A recount requested by Trump was wrapping up and wasn’t expected to change the overall outcome.

Trump, who for months has sowed unsubstantiated doubt about the integrity of mail-in votes, has also made baseless claims of widespread fraud in the presidential race in Georgia.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff have vehemently rebuffed those claims, stating unequivocally that there is no evidence of systemic errors or fraud in last month’s election. Yet Raffensperger and Gov. Brian Kemp, both Republicans who have been publicly lambasted by Trump, have joined the push to require a photo ID for absentee voting.

“Voters casting their ballots in person must show a photo ID, and we should consider applying that same standard to mail-in balloting,” Kemp said in remarks streamed live online.

Kemp faced accusations of voter suppression during his successful 2018 run for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams, an election he oversaw as Georgia’s previous secretary of state. He vehemently denied the allegations. Kemp faces reelection — and a possible rematch against Abrams — in 2022.

Raffensperger also has suggested allowing state officials to intervene in counties that have systemic problems with administering elections and broadening the ways in which challenges can be posed to votes cast by residents who don’t live where they say.

The photo ID idea has support among several members of the state legislature, including Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan. “I don’t think there should be different standards for the same process,” Dugan said in an interview.

Republican House Speaker David Ralston has been skeptical of voting by mail, telling a local news outlet in April that increased mail voting “will be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia.” Political analysts have said that typically more Democrats than Republicans use mail-in ballots.

Ralston later said he was not talking about his party losing an advantage but the potential for fraud. “We must do everything in our power to ensure votes are not stolen, cast fraudulently or plagued by administrative errors,” he said in a statement this week.

Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs said in an interview with The Associated Press that currently anyone who knows someone’s name, address and date of birth can request an absentee ballot on that person’s behalf. She said that while signature matches provide some security for mail-in ballots, the process should be shored up.

One way to do that could be to require a person’s driver’s license number or a photocopy of a separate form of ID, she said.

“We need to secure all avenues that we can of absentee ballots so we never have a candidate run around this state again saying the election was stolen because of absentee ballots,” she said.

While Republicans seem ready to press forward with the photo ID requirement during the upcoming legislative session, Democrats and civil rights organizations are raising alarms.

With no evidence of widespread fraud or other problems in the election, it doesn’t make sense to talk about measures that could ultimately prove to be barriers to voting, said Andrea Young, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia.

“What is the problem that you’re trying to solve?” she asked. “The rule should be first, ‘Do no harm’ when it comes to democracy, and whenever there are more restrictions being put on a process, you run the risk of disenfranchising Georgia citizens.”

Young says adding a photo ID requirement for absentee voting would be harmful because “we know that these barriers have a different impact on African American voters, on younger voters and, in this instance, on seniors who have certainly earned the right” to vote.

State Sen. Jen Jordan, an Atlanta Democrat, echoed Young’s concerns, saying Republicans were offering solutions in search of a problem.

“What this says to me is that they just don’t want people voting,” Jordan said. “And they specifically don’t want Democrats voting, or people that don’t support their chosen candidates voting, and they’re going to try to make it as hard as possible.”

Democrats and voting rights groups have for years sought to decrease rejections of absentee ballots in Georgia, arguing that minorities have been disproportionately affected. Absentee ballots are sometimes rejected because signatures on the outer envelope are deemed not to match signatures in the voter registration system, or because the envelope is not signed at all.

An agreement signed in March to settle a lawsuit filed by the Democratic Party spells out a standard process that must be used statewide to judge the signatures. That agreement has been the subject of much of Trump’s online ire, and he has incorrectly said it “makes it impossible to check & match signatures on ballots and envelopes.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden is facing escalating pressure from competing factions within his own party as he finalizes his choice for secretary of defense.

Black leaders have encouraged the incoming president to select an African American to diversify what has so far been a largely white prospective Cabinet, while others are pushing him to appoint a woman to lead the Department of Defense for the first time.

At the same time, a growing collection of progressive groups is opposing the leading female contender, Michèle Flournoy, citing concerns about her record and private-sector associations.

A coalition of at least seven progressive groups warned Biden to avoid Flournoy in an open letter to Biden obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press that referenced her record of “ill-advised policy decisions” — particularly in relation to Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Afghanistan — and an “opaque history of private-sector activity.”

“Ms. Flournoy’s consistent support for military interventions has contributed to devastating crises around the world, including in Yemen,” said Jehan Hakim, chairperson of the Yemeni Alliance Committee, which helped organize the letter.

Other contenders are emerging, including retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin and Jeh Johnson, who served as the Pentagon’s top lawyer and then as head of the Department of Homeland Security during President Barack Obama’s second term. Both Austin and Johnson are Black.

The competing pressures are intensifying less than a month into Biden’s urgent push to build an administration while trying to preserve the broad coalition that fueled his victory over President Donald Trump last month.

And facing massive governing challenges once he takes office on Jan. 20, Biden can perhaps least afford to lose the backing of the Democratic Party’s fiery progressive base. Nearly 100 House Democrats belong to the Progressive Caucus, which may wield significant influence over Biden’s policy agenda as Democrats cling to their narrowest House majority in a century.

Biden has already promised to enact a sweeping pandemic relief bill while overhauling health care, immigration and education systems and fighting for the most aggressive environmental protections in U.S. history.

Progressive groups have cheered a handful of Biden’s early hires — particularly Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein to his Council of Economic Advisers — but have been far from satisfied overall. Despite early disappointment, they have resisted the temptation to embrace an adversarial tone as they decide how to flex their muscles most effectively in the new political climate, especially with several major Cabinet positions and senior positions yet to be filled.

Justice Democrats spokesperson Waleed Shahid called Biden’s early picks “a mixed bag,” but noted that they have generally been more progressive than Obama’s early picks after his 2008 election victory.

“The thing that was alarming to me was when Joe Biden said, ‘We already have a significant number of progressives in our administration,’” Shahid said. “I talked to a lot of people, and they said, ‘We have no idea what he’s talking about.’”

Beyond the Defense Department, progressives are gearing up for the possibility of more aggressive fights on Commerce, Labor, Education, Interior and Justice, among other unfilled Cabinet posts. They have already signaled intense opposition to the likes of Rahm Emanuel, a former Obama White House chief being considered for transportation secretary, and Mike Morell, another Obama-era figure being eyed for CIA director.

Flournoy, meanwhile, had been seen as the leading candidate for defense secretary under a Democratic president since Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 campaign.

She stood out as deeply experienced, respected on Capitol Hill and well known on the international stage. But soon after Biden’s victory, her stock seemed to slip as others, including Austin and Johnson, came into consideration.

A leading Black voice in Congress, South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, has openly called for Biden to choose more Black men and women for Cabinet positions. The Pentagon job, which has never been held by a woman or a Black person, is one of the last remaining opportunities for Biden to demonstrate his commitment to diversity at the senior levels of his national security team.

Liberal critics have suggested Flournoy’s views are more hawkish than the president-elect’s, particularly on the Afghanistan War, and some have pointed to her position as a co-founder of consulting firm WestExec Advisors, which provides what it calls “unique geopolitical and policy expertise to help business leaders” and which has become a source of Biden selections for other national security positions. Another of WestExec’s founders, Antony Blinken, is Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, and Avril Haines, the nominee for director of national intelligence, is a former WestExec principal.

There was no reference to race or gender in Wednesday’s letter opposing Flournoy. The signatories include the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation; Justice Democrats, which is aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; Demand Progress; and Just Foreign Policy, among others.

They were especially critical of reports that Flournoy had resisted calls to end the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Biden has promised to end U.S. support for the war.

The letter offers support for two potential Flournoy alternatives: Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Advisers for both camps declined to comment, though neither is believed to have emerged as a leading contender. Gillibrand, in particular, is thought to have little interest in the position.

“While we are by no means winning all of these fights, it is clear that a focus by progressives on personnel is making a difference that will likely pay dividends when it comes to policy determinations over years to come,” said David Segal, who leads the progressive group Demand Progress.

He added, however, that “the national security space is more worrisome.”

Shahid, of Justice Democrats, suggested that progressives would give Biden a relatively long leash before revolting, even if there are more disappointments to come as he builds out his administration.

The true nature of Biden’s presidency won’t be known until he takes office in January and begins to work with Congress to enact his agenda, Shahid said. Biden has promised both to fight for big, bold policy changes and to compromise with Republicans.

“In the same way Joe Biden said his campaign was a fight for the soul of America, the Cabinet is the beginning, not the end, of the fight for the soul of the Biden presidency,” Shahid said. “If he chooses the path of deal-making with Mitch McConnell, those divides within the Democratic Party will become much more apparent.”"
Comcast Got $1 Billion in Public Subsidies. Now Its Charging the Public New Data Fees.,7,k5e6fc,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/comcast-data-fees-caps-public-subsidies,2,1606960055.0,,"With millions of Americans stuck at home to protect themselves from a deadly pandemic during the holiday season, the internet is one of the only conduits connecting them to friends, family, and the outside world. Now, Comcast, one of the monopoly corporations that controls the conduit, is extending its fees on bandwidth usage to all thirty-nine states where it operates — even as the company has received hundreds of millions of dollars of public subsidies and new tax breaks.

Whether or not those data caps remain permanent could hinge on whether president-elect Joe Biden and Democrats are willing to take action against a corporation that has been one of their major campaign donors.

At issue is Comcast’s move on Monday that caps home internet usage at 1.2TB of data per month for its customers in twelve additional states, and charging customers up to $100 per month if they exceed the cap. Comcast’s move was flagged by Stop the Cap, which discovered that the company had quietly updated language on its website.

The new limits, which will take effect in March, are being imposed in states that have given Comcast and its subsidiaries more than $738 million in tax subsidies in the last few decades. Those states include New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, where state and local governments have given Comcast and its subsidiaries $484 million, $132 million, and $79 million in tax subsidies, respectively, according to data from Good Jobs First.

In all, Comcast and its subsidiaries — which include NBC and MSNBC — have received nearly $1 billion in state and local subsidies. Additionally, Comcast received $861 million in federal tax subsidies during the first year of the Trump tax cuts, according to the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy.

“This is why monopolies are bad,” tweeted Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization. “Comcast can arbitrarily exploit us for profit during a pandemic just because it feels like it. Meanwhile, Comcast collects tons of tax breaks and government subsidies. Comcast should be broken up.”

The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) recommended in March that internet service providers relax their data cap policies in order to “promote connectivity” during the pandemic. The recommendation was attached to an FCC campaign to ensure continued internet service throughout the pandemic, called the “Keep Americans Connected Pledge,” which Comcast signed. The pledge expired on June 30.

In 2018, Comcast announced that it had disabled the system it used to slow down heavy internet users because its network was strong enough to handle the traffic. Without the need for a congestion management system, it was unclear why data caps were ever necessary in the twenty-seven states where Comcast included them as part of its Internet plans. Comcast reportedly said it was keeping the data caps in place “based on a principle of fairness.”"

NEW YORK (AP) — National lawmakers introduced a joint resolution Wednesday aimed at striking language from the U.S. Constitution that enshrines a form of slavery in America’s foundational documents.

The resolution, spearheaded and supported by Democratic members of the House and Senate, would amend the 13th Amendment’s ban on chattel enslavement to expressly prohibit involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. As ratified, the original amendment has permitted exploitation of labor by convicted felons for over 155 years since the abolition of slavery.

The 13th Amendment “continued the process of a white power class gravely mistreating Black Americans, creating generations of poverty, the breakup of families and this wave of mass incarceration that we still wrestle with today,” Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon told The Associated Press ahead of the resolution’s introduction.

A House version is led by outgoing Rep. William Lacy Clay, of St. Louis, who said the amendment “seeks to finish the job that President (Abraham) Lincoln started.”

It would “eliminate the dehumanizing and discriminatory forced labor of prisoners for profit that has been used to drive the over-incarceration of African Americans since the end of the Civil War,” Clay said.

In the Senate, the resolution has Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland signed on as co-sponsors. “This change to the 13th Amendment will finally, fully rid our nation of a form of legalized slavery,” Van Hollen said in an emailed statement.

Constitutional amendments are rare and require approval by two-thirds of the House and Senate, as well as ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures. Should the proposal fail to move out of committee in the remaining weeks of the current Congress, Merkley said he hoped to revive it next year.

The effort has been endorsed by more than a dozen human rights and social justice organizations, including The Sentencing Project, the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and Color of Change.

“It is long past time that Congress excise this language from the U.S. Constitution which should begin to put an end to the abusive practices derived from it,” said Laura Pitter, deputy director of the U.S. program at Human Rights Watch, which also endorsed the amendment.

The proposed amendment comes nearly one month after voters in Nebraska and Utah approved initiatives amending their state constitutions to remove language that allows slavery and involuntary servitude as criminal punishments. In 2018, Colorado was among the first U.S. states to remove such language by ballot measure.

Although nearly half of state constitutions do not mention human bondage or prison labor as punishment, just over 20 states still include such clauses in governing documents that date back to the 19th century abolition of slavery.

In Merkley’s Oregon, voters in 2002 approved the elimination of constitutional language that prohibited Black Americans from living in the state unless they were enslaved.

He said the movement toward a federal amendment is “kind of saying to the world, let’s not forget this big piece of injustice that’s sitting squarely in the middle of our Constitution, as we wrestle with criminal justice reform.”

Many Americans will recognize modern-day prison labor as chain gangs deployed from prison facilities for agricultural and infrastructure work. The prevalence of prison labor has been largely accepted as a means for promoting rehabilitation, teaching trade skills and reducing idleness among prisoners.

But the practice has a much darker history. Following the abolition of slavery, Southern states that lost the literal backbone of their economies began criminalizing formerly enslaved Black men and women for offenses as petty as vagrancy or having unkempt children.

This allowed legal re-enslavement of African Americans, who were no longer seen as sympathetic victims of inhumane bondage, said Michele Goodwin, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Irvine.

“These people became criminals, and it became very difficult for many abolitionists to use the same kinds of emotional messaging about the humanity of these individuals,” Goodwin said.

Today, incarcerated workers, many of them making pennies on the dollar, work in plants, manufacturing clothing, assembling furniture and even battling wildfires across the U.S., much of it to the benefit of large corporations, governments and communities where they’ve historically been unwelcome upon release.

Researchers have estimated the minimum annual value of prison labor commodities at $2 billion, derived largely through a system of convict leasing that leaves these workers without the legal protections and benefits that Americans are otherwise entitled to.

And while prison work is largely optional for the 2.2 million individuals incarcerated in the U.S., it’s a grave mistake to disassociate their labor from the original intent of the penal system, Goodwin said.

“Your freedom has been taken away — that’s the punishment that society has assigned,” she said. “The punishment is not that you do slave work, that is unpaid labor or barely paid labor.”

"Justice Department investigating potential presidential pardon bribery scheme, court records reveal",241,k4xf4e,https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/01/politics/presidential-pardon-justice-department/index.html,21,1606895694.0,,"(CNN) The Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House or related political committee in exchange for a presidential pardon, according to court records unsealed Tuesday in federal court.

The case is the latest legal twist in the waning days of President Donald Trump's administration after several of his top advisers have been convicted of federal criminal charges and as the possibility rises of Trump giving pardons to those who've been loyal to him.

The disclosure is in 20 pages of partially redacted documents made public by the DC District Court on Tuesday afternoon. The records show Chief Judge Beryl Howell's review in August of a request from prosecutors to access documents obtained in a search as part of a bribery-for-pardon investigation.

The filings don't reveal a timeline of the alleged scheme, or any names of people potentially involved, except that communications between people including at least one lawyer were seized from an office that was raided sometime before the end of this summer.

No one appears to have been publicly charged with a related crime to date."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General William Barr has given extra protection to the prosecutor he appointed to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, granting him authority to complete the work without being easily fired.

Barr told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as a special counsel in October under the same federal regulations that governed special counsel Robert Mueller in the original Russia probe. He said Durham’s investigation has been narrowing to focus more on the conduct of FBI agents who worked on the Russia investigation, known by the code name of Crossfire Hurricane.

ADVERTISEMENT

Under the regulations, a special counsel can be fired only by the attorney general and for specific reasons such as misconduct, dereliction of duty or conflict of interest. An attorney general must document such reasons in writing.

The FBI in July 2016 began investigating whether the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russia to sway the outcome of the presidential election. That probe was inherited nearly a year later by special counsel Mueller, who ultimately did not find enough evidence to charge Trump or any of his associates with conspiring with Russia.

The early months of the investigation, when agents obtained secret surveillance warrants targeting a former Trump campaign aide, have long been scrutinized by the president and other critics of the probe who say the FBI made significant errors. An inspector general report last year backed up that criticism but did not find evidence that mistakes in the surveillance applications and other problems with the probe were driven by partisan bias.

Barr decided “the best thing to do would be to appoint them under the same regulation that covered Bob Mueller, to provide Durham and his team some assurance that they’d be able to complete their work regardless of the outcome of the election,” he said Tuesday.

President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team didn’t immediately comment on the appointment.

The current investigation, a criminal probe, had begun very broadly but has since “narrowed considerably” and now “really is focused on the activities of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation within the FBI,” Barr said. He said he expects Durham would detail whether any additional prosecutions will be brought and make public a report of the investigation’s findings.

Durham’s investigation has resulted in one prosecution so far: a guilty plea by a former FBI lawyer who admitted altering an email.

In an Oct. 19 order, obtained by The Associated Press, Barr says Durham is authorized “to investigate whether any federal official, employee or any person or entity violated the law in connection with the intelligence, counter-intelligence or law enforcement activities” directed at the 2016 presidential campaigns, anyone associated with the campaigns or the Trump administration.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the appointment erodes trust in the Justice Department, and he questioned how it was allowed under the special counsel rules.

“And we should not lose sight of the larger picture: in the waning days of the Trump administration, the attorney general has once again used the powers of his office to settle old scores for the president,” Nadler said.

The special counsel rules say the appointed person should be outside of government, but Barr pointed to specific provisions in his memo that would allow him to go around that rule.

A senior Justice Department official told the AP that although the order details that it is “including but not limited to Crossfire Hurricane and the investigation of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III,” the Durham probe has not expanded.

The official said that line specifically relates to FBI personnel who worked on the Russia investigation before the May 2017 appointment of Mueller, a critical area of scrutiny for the Justice Department inspector general, which identified a series of errors and omissions in surveillance applications targeting former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

The focus on the FBI, rather than the CIA and the intelligence community, suggests that Durham may have moved past some of the more incendiary claims that Trump supporters had hoped would yield allegations of misconduct, or even crimes — namely, the question of how intelligence agencies reached their conclusion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election.

Republicans lauded the appointment. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said it was “obvious the system failed” and he concurred with the appointment of a special counsel to continue the investigation."
Giuliani Is Said to Have Discussed a Pardon With Trump,17,k4ursw,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-pardon.html,10,1606887514.0,,"[Follow our live coverage as Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol.]

President Trump has discussed with advisers whether to grant pre-emptive pardons to his children, to his son-in-law and to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and talked with Mr. Giuliani about pardoning him as recently as last week, according to two people briefed on the matter.

Mr. Trump has told others that he is concerned that a Biden Justice Department might seek retribution against the president by targeting the oldest three of his five children — Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump — as well as Ms. Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, a White House senior adviser.

Donald Trump Jr. had been under investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for contacts that the younger Mr. Trump had had with Russians offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, but he was never charged. Mr. Kushner provided false information to federal authorities about his contacts with foreigners for his security clearance, but was given one anyway by the president.

The nature of Mr. Trump’s concern about any potential criminal exposure of Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump is unclear, although an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney into the Trump Organization has expanded to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in consulting fees by the company, some of which appear to have gone to Ms. Trump."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Disputing President Donald Trump’s persistent, baseless claims, Attorney General William Barr declared Tuesday the U.S. Justice Department has uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election.

Barr’s comments, in an interview with the The Associated Press, contradict the concerted effort by Trump, his boss, to subvert the results of last month’s voting and block President-elect Joe Biden from taking his place in the White House.

Barr told the AP that U.S. attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they’ve received, but “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”

The comments, which drew immediate criticism from Trump attorneys, were especially notable coming from Barr, who has been one of the president’s most ardent allies. Before the election, he had repeatedly raised the notion that mail-in voting could be especially vulnerable to fraud during the coronavirus pandemic as Americans feared going to polls and instead chose to vote by mail.

More to Trump’s liking, Barr revealed in the AP interview that in October he had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as a special counsel , giving the prosecutor the authority to continue to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe after Biden takes over and making it difficult to fire him. Biden hasn’t said what he might do with the investigation, and his transition team didn’t comment Tuesday.

Trump has long railed against the investigation into whether his 2016 campaign was coordinating with Russia, but he and Republican allies had hoped the results would be delivered before the 2020 election and would help sway voters. So far, there has been only one criminal case, a guilty plea from a former FBI lawyer to a single false statement charge.

Under federal regulations, a special counsel can be fired only by the attorney general and for specific reasons such as misconduct, dereliction of duty or conflict of interest. An attorney general must document such reasons in writing.

Barr went to the White House Tuesday for a previously scheduled meeting that lasted about three hours.

Trump didn’t directly comment on the attorney general’s remarks on the election. But his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his political campaign issued a scathing statement claiming that, “with all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn’t been any semblance” of an investigation into the president’s complaints.

Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. (Dec. 1)

Other administration officials who have come out forcefully against Trump’s allegations of voter-fraud evidence have been fired. But it’s not clear whether Barr might suffer the same fate. He maintains a lofty position with Trump, and despite their differences the two see eye-to-eye on quite a lot.

Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer quipped: “I guess he’s the next one to be fired.”

Last month, Barr issued a directive to U.S. attorneys across the country allowing them to pursue any “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities before the 2020 presidential election was certified, despite no evidence at that time of widespread fraud.

That memorandum gave prosecutors the ability to go around longstanding Justice Department policy that normally would prohibit such overt actions before the election was certified. Soon after it was issued, the department’s top elections crime official announced he would step aside from that position because of the memo.

The Trump campaign team led by Giuliani has been alleging a widespread conspiracy by Democrats to dump millions of illegal votes into the system with no evidence. They have filed multiple lawsuits in battleground states alleging that partisan poll watchers didn’t have a clear enough view at polling sites in some locations and therefore something illegal must have happened. The claims have been repeatedly dismissed including by Republican judges who have ruled the suits lacked evidence.

But local Republicans in some battleground states have followed Trump in making unsupported claims, prompting grave concerns over potential damage to American democracy.

Trump himself continues to rail against the election in tweets and in interviews though his own administration has said the 2020 election was the most secure ever . He recently allowed his administration to begin the transition over to Biden, but he still refuses to admit he lost.

The issues they’ve have pointed to are typical in every election: Problems with signatures, secrecy envelopes and postal marks on mail-in ballots, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost.

But they’ve gone further. Attorney Sidney Powell has spun fictional tales of election systems flipping votes, German servers storing U.S. voting information and election software created in Venezuela “at the direction of Hugo Chavez,” – the late Venezuelan president who died in 2013. Powell has since been removed from the legal team after an interview she gave where she threatened to “blow up” Georgia with a “biblical” court filing.

Barr didn’t name Powell specifically but said: “There’s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven’t seen anything to substantiate that.”

In the campaign statement, Giuliani claimed there was “ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined.”

The Justice Department also hasn’t audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth,” he said.

However, Barr said earlier that people were confusing the use of the federal criminal justice system with allegations that should be made in civil lawsuits. He said a remedy for many complaints would be a top-down audit by state or local officials, not the U.S. Justice Department.

“There’s a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all,” he said, but first there must be a basis to believe there is a crime to investigate.

“Most claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. ... And those have been run down; they are being run down,” Barr said. “Some have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.”

House Democrats urge congressional leaders to support $12.1B budget for IRS,274,k4kuvo,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/528035-house-democrats-urge-congressional-leaders-to-support-121b-budget-for-irs,43,1606858291.0,,"A group of House Democrats are urging key members of Congress to support the $12.1 billion IRS budget for fiscal 2021 proposed in legislation that passed the House, as lawmakers work to finalize a government funding package in the coming days.

The $12.1 billion level proposed by the Democratic-controlled House includes $5.2 billion for enforcement purposes.

A proposal released by the Republican-controlled Senate Appropriations Committee calls for an overall IRS funding level for 2021 of $11.5 billion and an enforcement budget of $5 billion, maintaining the enacted levels for fiscal 2020.

""We urge you to retain the House-passed funding level of $12.1 billion for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), including $5.2 billion for enforcement activities that are critical to ensuring compliance with our voluntary tax system and protecting taxpayer dollars from fraud,"" the Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOn The Money: Reddit traders cause Wall Street havoc | Powell: Inflation fears should not impede more coronavirus aid | NJ lawmakers press for SALT cap repeal in next relief package Pelosi asks Democrats to 'write their stories' of Capitol riot Bringing America back from the brink MORE (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse Democrat touts resolution to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress Bringing America back from the brink Senate GOP slow walking Biden's pick to lead DHS MORE (R-Ky.), and the leaders of the House appropriations subcommittees with jurisdiction over the IRS.

The IRS saw budget cuts during much of the last decade. Democrats have been pushing to boost the agency's funding to enhance the agency's taxpayer services and enforcement, and some Republicans have also expressed openness to providing the IRS with more resources.

The signers of the letter said that ""the strength of IRS enforcement activities must be a priority for Congress, especially considering the additional measures Congress enacted under the CARES Act to lessen the financial burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.""

They noted that much of the recent work by the IRS Criminal Investigations Division has focused on fraud connected to coronavirus relief programs, such as the stimulus payments and the Paycheck Protection Program.

The lawmakers also pointed to a recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office that found that increasing the IRS's funding for collections and enforcement by $20 billion over a decade would increase revenue by $61 billion. They said that more funding for IRS enforcement could help ensure that taxes owed by the wealthiest individuals are effectively collected.

Congress needs to pass appropriations legislation by Dec. 11 in order to prevent a government shutdown."
Biden Covid advisor on Dr. Atlas resignation: 'I am relieved' because he wasn’t qualified,14,k4enrz,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/biden-covid-advisor-relieved-about-dr-scott-atlas-resignation-.html,3,1606829627.0,,"President-elect Joe Biden's Covid advisory board member Dr. Celine Gounder told CNBC that she is ""relieved"" upon hearing news that President Donald Trump's special advisor on the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Scott Atlas, formally resigned from his post.

""I am relieved that in the future that people who are qualified, people who are infectious disease specialists and epidemiologists like me will be helping to lead this effort, people who are experts in this,"" Gounder said in a Monday evening interview on ""The News with Shepard Smith."" ""You wouldn't go to a podiatrist for a heart attack, and that was essentially what was happening.""

Atlas specializes in neuroradiology and has no background in infectious diseases. After he repeatedly pushed to reopen schools and questioned the efficacy of masks, dozens of Stanford Medical researchers and doctors called out their former colleague. They alleged that Atlas was spreading ""falsehoods and misrepresentation of science.""

In his resignation letter, Atlas said he ""always relied on latest science and evidence"" and ""synthesized the latest data"" as he learned new information.

""Although some may disagree with those recommendations, it is the free exchange of ideas that lead to scientific truths, which are the very foundation of any civilized society,"" he wrote.

Atlas's resignation comes as coronavirus cases continue to surge across the country. The United States has averaged more than 162,000 cases a day over the past week, and this month alone, reported more than 4.2 million new cases. That means nearly one-third of all of the country's cases have been added in November, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins data.

The Trump administration's policies differ substantially from what those of the incoming Biden administration's will be especially around masks and testing, according to Gounder, who is an epidemiologist at NYU.

""Unfortunately mask wearing has been politicized where this is really just a basic hygienic measure, like using toilet paper, that should never have turned into a political symbol,"" Gounder said. ""As for testing, the current administration has actively discouraged people from getting tested, and has said we're getting tested too much.""

In June, Trump told supporters at a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma that increased testing leads to counting more cases of the virus.

""When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases,"" Trump said. ""So I said to my people, 'Slow the testing down, please.' They test and they test.""

Hospitals across the country are grappling with the surge in cases. More than 93,000 Americans are hospitalized with Covid-19 — an all-time high according to the Covid Tracking Project.

Gounder said that the Biden administration will start by focusing on the location of vaccine sites in order to ensure that Black and minority communities will have an equal opportunity to get an approved Covid vaccine.

""For example with testing, we've seen fewer testing sites in communities of color, the lines have been longer, the turnaround times have been longer,"" explained Gounder. ""So really making sure that we work with providers who care for those communities to make sure that they are able to provide access to the vaccine too."""

The agency said Thursday that the deal with ClearSpace SA will lead to the “first active debris removal mission” in 2025, in which a custom-made spacecraft will capture and bring down part of a rocket once used to deliver a satellite into orbit.

Experts have long warned that hundreds of thousands of pieces of space debris circling the planet — including an astronaut’s lost mirror — pose a threat to functioning satellites and even the International Space Station. Several teams are working on ways to tackle the problem .

The Supreme Court Must Choose Between Trump and the Constitution in the Census Case,233,k3v03m,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/trump-v-new-york-supreme-court-census-case-test.amp,122,1606768618.0,,"Critics of conservative originalism have charged that it is just a fancy word used to reach conservative results and sanction discrimination. The Supreme Court’s blockbuster census case, Trump v. New York, which will be argued on Monday, will be a major test of whether there is a principled core to conservative originalism. It will help show whether the court’s conservatives are willing to follow the Constitution’s text and history where it leads.

Throughout his presidency, President Donald Trump has flouted the parts of the Constitution he does not like. Trump v. New York involves President Trump’s decision to disregard the federal government’s constitutional obligation to count all persons residing in the United States in apportioning representatives for Congress. On July 21, President Trump announced it would be the “policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status,” disregarding the fact that the Constitution explicitly requires counting all persons in the apportionment base in order to ensure equal representation for all persons.

The constitutional question in Trump v. New York is open and shut. The Constitution, through Article I and the Fourteenth Amendment, explicitly requires the federal government to conduct an “actual Enumeration” of the people and to count the “whole number of persons in each State” to apportion representatives to Congress. The Constitution’s Framers wrote the requirement to conduct a census count of the people directly into the Constitution—the first nation in history to do so—in order to prevent manipulation of our democracy. It is fundamental to our democracy that the government cannot rig the census by excluding persons living in the United States from the count used to apportion representatives to Congress.

The import of the Constitution’s text is clear. Immigrants residing in the United States—regardless of their citizenship status—are persons who must be counted for apportionment purposes. The Constitution does not give the president the power to pick and choose among the people who live in the United States and decide that some people should be excluded from the constitutionally mandated census count used to apportion representatives to Congress simply because they are undocumented immigrants. By seeking to treat undocumented immigrants as non-persons, the president has run afoul of the basic constitutional rule that our system of political representation depends on a count of the entire populace.

In some parts of the Constitution, our charter explicitly uses the term “citizens,” but the Framers chose to utilize the broader term “persons” in mandating a count of the nation’s populace in apportioning representatives to Congress. The Census Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment draw no distinction between citizens and non-citizens. The sweeping language chosen by the Framers requires that the “whole immigrant population should be numbered with the people and counted as part of them,” as John Bingham argued during the debates over the Fourteenth Amendment.

In fact, the question whether noncitizens should be excluded from the apportionment base was discussed at length during the debates over the Fourteenth Amendment. During those debates, many members of Congress urged that only citizens or voters should be counted in determining congressional representation, insisting that foreigners who had arrived in America should not count for purposes of apportioning representatives to Congress. Following more than seven months of heated debate in Congress, the Fourteenth Amendment reaffirmed the federal government’s duty to count the nation’s whole population, including the entire immigration population, in apportioning representatives to Congress.

A count of the total population, Sen. Jacob Howard explained, is “the safest and most secure principle upon which the Government can rest. Numbers, not voters; numbers, not property; this is the theory of the Constitution.” The authors of the Fourteenth Amendment refused to “strike from the basis of representation the entire immigrant population not naturalized,” insisting that “[u]nder the Constitution as it now is and as it always has been, the entire immigrant population of this country is included in the basis of representation.” This history should be decisive.

To get around the Constitution’s plain command to count all persons, the Trump administration makes the specious claim that “the Constitution does not specifically define which persons must be included in the apportionment base” and that the president has discretion to exclude all undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base on the theory that they are not truly inhabitants of the United States, even if they have lived here for many years. This argument deserves to be laughed out of court.

In some cases, conservative and progressive originalists may reasonably disagree about what the Constitution means. Not here.

The Constitution’s text and history unambiguously answer whether the president can treat undocumented immigrants as non-persons and exclude them from the apportionment base. He cannot. The Constitution’s text requires counting all persons—regardless of where they are from—in apportioning representatives to Congress. As history shows, the decision to count all persons was a conscious choice, reflecting the basic idea that all persons—whether they are citizens or not—deserve to be represented in the halls of Congress. Our Constitution’s Framers designed a system of government in which immigrants—regardless of their citizenship status—are entitled to equal representation. President Trump simply cannot abide this fundamental aspect of our constitutional democracy.

Trump v. New York poses a basic test of constitutional fidelity to long settled constitutional principles at the core of our democracy. If Justice Amy Coney Barrett and the Supreme Court’s conservative originalists fail this test, it will go a long way to defining the Roberts court going forward."
Kremlin rebuffs Moldovan idea to replace its troops in breakaway region,101,k3uwpg,https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-moldova-peacekeepers/kremlin-rebuffs-moldovan-idea-to-replace-its-troops-in-breakaway-region-idUSKBN28A14R?il=0,4,1606768201.0,,"MOSCOW/CHISINAU (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Monday rebuffed calls by Moldova’s incoming president, Maia Sandu, for Russian troops to withdraw from the breakaway region of Transdniestria, saying it would be seriously destabilising.

FILE PHOTO: Maia Sandu, winner of the second round of a presidential election, attends a news conference in Chisinau, Moldova November 16, 2020. REUTERS/Vladislav Culiomza

Sandu, a former World Bank economist who favours closer ties with the European Union, defeated the pro-Russian incumbent Igor Dodon in the second round of Moldova’s presidential election on Nov 15.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to congratulate Sandu, but Dodon’s defeat marked a setback for the Kremlin in Moldova, a small ex-Soviet republic sandwiched between Ukraine and EU member state Romania.

Sandu struck a conciliatory tone after her victory but on Monday called for Russian troops in Transdniestria to be removed in favour of civilian monitors under the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia expected the authorities in Chisinau to remain constructive.

“Russia performs a very important function ... And of course, a change in some status quo, which is based on the spirit and letter of international law, could lead to serious destabilisation,” Peskov told reporters in Moscow.

SEPARATISTS

The Russian-speakers of Transdniestria nominally seceded from Moldova in 1990, one year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, fearing the country might shortly merge with Romania, whose language and culture it broadly shares.

The separatist region fought a brief war with Moldova in 1992 and declared itself an independent state, though it remains unrecognised by any country, including Russia.

Some pro-Kremlin hawks still fear that Romania may one day try to absorb Moldova, and that Sandu’s win will inevitably see Russian influence weaken.

Sandu told a press conference she wanted dialogue, adding: “We are an independent country that does not want foreign troops to stay on its territory.”

The continued Russian troop presence hobbles Moldova’s chances of joining the European Union.

Chisinau signed a political and trade deal with the EU in 2014, angering Moscow, though Brussels has also become increasingly critical of Moldova’s track record on reforms and tackling corruption."

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden fractured his right foot while playing with one of his dogs, an injury discovered in a scan Sunday and that will likely require him to wear a boot for several weeks, his doctor said.

Biden suffered the injury on Saturday and visited an orthopedist in Newark, Delaware, on Sunday afternoon, his office said.

“Initial x-rays did not show any obvious fracture,” but medical staff ordered a more detailed CT scan, his doctor, Kevin O’Connor, said in a statement. The subsequent scan found tiny fractures of two small bones in the middle of his right foot, O’Connor said.

“It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks,” O’Connor said.

Fractures are a concern generally as people age, but Biden’s appears to be a relatively mild one based on his doctor’s statement and the planned treatment. At 78 he will be the oldest president when he’s inaugurated in January; he often dismissed questions about his age during the campaign.

Reporters covering the president-elect were not afforded the opportunity to see Biden enter the doctor’s office Sunday, despite multiple requests. Leaving the doctor’s office to head to an imaging center for his CT scan, Biden was visibly limping, though he walked without a crutch or other aid.

Biden sustained the injury playing with Major, one of the Bidens’ two dogs. They adopted Major in 2018, and acquired their first dog, Champ, after the 2008 election. The Bidens have said they’ll be bringing their dogs to the White House and also plan to get a cat.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Faulting inaction in Washington, governors and state lawmakers are racing to get pandemic relief to small-business owners, the unemployed, renters and others whose livelihoods have been upended by the widening coronavirus outbreak.

In some cases, elected officials are spending the last of a federal relief package passed in the spring as an end-of-year deadline approaches and the fall COVID-19 surge threatens their economies anew. Democrats have been the most vocal in criticizing President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Senate for failing to act, but many Republican lawmakers are also sounding the alarm.

Underscoring the need for urgency, the number of new COVID-19 cases reported in the United States reached 205,557 on Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University – the first time its daily figure topped the 200,000 mark. Its previous daily high was 196,000 on Nov. 20.

The total number of cases reported in the U.S., since the first one in January, has topped 13 million.

The Democratic governors of Colorado and New Mexico convened special legislative sessions in the closing days of November to address the virus-related emergency. Earlier this week, the New Mexico Legislature passed a bipartisan relief bill that will deliver a one-time $1,200 check to all unemployed workers and give up to $50,000 to certain businesses.

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state took action to help residents “who have real issues about keeping food on their table, a roof over their head.”

“While the United States of America is on fire, the Trump administration has left states to fight this virus on their own,” she said, noting state efforts alone simply are not enough. “It is clear no help is coming — not from this president, not from this administration. As we have done every day this year, New Mexico will step up.”

In Colorado, a special session scheduled for Monday will consider roughly $300 million in relief to businesses, restaurants and bars, child-care providers, landlords, tenants, public schools and others.

“Even as cases have exploded across the country, Congress and the president have not yet passed much-needed relief for people,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in announcing the session. “Here in Colorado, we want to do the best with what we have to take care of our own.”

In New Jersey and Washington state, Republicans who are a minority in both legislatures were the ones pushing for special sessions. They want to direct more money to struggling small-business owners.

Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin, who control both houses of the Legislature, are considering whether to return in December to address effects of the latest coronavirus wave after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers put forward a $500 million COVID-19 relief bill earlier this week. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, plans to convene lawmakers in December to contend with the virus, partially at Republicans’ urging.

“Senate Republicans are committed to recovering our economy that has been harmed by broad and prolonged shutdowns,” Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said in a statement. “We will work with anyone to find solutions.”

State government leaders want Trump and Congress to extend the Dec. 30 deadline for spending virus relief money already allocated under the CARES Act, which was approved in March, and to provide more federal funding to deal with the consequences of the latest surge.

“It’s just heartbreaking what they’re allowing to happen with no federal government intervention,” said Washington state House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, a Democrat.

In making his decision to call the Minnesota Legislature into special session, Walz cited “a sense of urgency” around doing something on the state level due to the lack of a federal response.

The Minnesota Council of Nonprofits reported that more than half of the state’s charitable organizations received forgivable loans through the CARES Act’s Paycheck Protection Program this year, while another $12 million from the CARES Act is going to organizations that provide food to the needy. But all that will be spent — or lost — by the end of December without congressional action.

“I would reiterate to our federal partners — to the outgoing administration and to the incoming Biden administration — please work together, please find a compromise in there, please. If you have to, move a package now with the idea that you will come back and move one later,” Walz said. “COVID is not going to end at the end of the month. We are in an unrelenting spike.”

In Ohio, where Republicans control every branch of government, Gov. Mike DeWine and legislative leaders pushed a $420 million pandemic spending package through a special bipartisan panel late last month. Funded through the CARES Act, it offered grants to small businesses, bars and restaurants, low-income renters, arts groups, and colleges and universities.

Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican, gives credit to the federal government for the billions in aid previously sent out, but he said small businesses and people who have lost work need more federal assistance.

“The election’s over,” Benninghoff said. “This is not a time for finger-pointing.”

In neighboring New Jersey, the partisan divide over $4 billion in COVID-19 borrowing backed by the Democratic governor and Legislature prompted a court challenge by minority Republicans. The state’s high court sided with Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, citing the unprecedented nature of the outbreak.

Even so, Murphy has regularly pleaded with Congress for more aid.

“It’s shameful that they have not acted in Congress, especially (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell and the Republican Senate, to throw a lifeline to small businesses,” he said.

Republicans have proposed a $300 million aid package to small businesses and nonprofits, but the legislation is stalled. GOP lawmakers told the governor if he does not call a special session to address the need, many businesses and charities “might not survive the winter.”

Having already committed the bulk of their virus relief allotment, lawmakers in one state, Illinois, were forced to end the year with an unaddressed $3.9 billion budget deficit. They canceled what would be their regular fall session in November, citing the health threat posed by the virus, and expressed hope for help from the nation’s capital when they return.

“If the federal government doesn’t stand up and step in, we’re in a very bad situation — for our schools, colleges and universities, health care programs, child care, senior services,” House Majority Leader Greg Harris, a Democrat, said. “This isn’t like all the blue states are hurting and all the red states are humming along. Everybody’s in bad shape.”

"In fresh blow to Trump, U.S. court rejects Pennsylvania election case",397,k29zja,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2872AZ?il=0,21,1606541021.0,,"(Reuters) -A federal appeals court on Friday rejected an attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign to block President-elect Joe Biden from being declared the winner of Pennsylvania, dealing another significant setback to Trump’s bid to overturn the Nov. 3 election.

“Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so,” wrote Stephanos Bibas on behalf of a three-judge panel.

“Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here,” wrote Bibas, who was nominated by Trump.

The Trump campaign and its supporters have tried and failed to convince judges of election irregularities in Michigan, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all critical to Biden’s victory.

“Voters, not lawyers, choose the President. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections,” said the appeals court opinion.

“On to SCOTUS!” wrote Jenna Ellis, a Trump campaign attorney, on Twitter after the ruling, referring to a planned appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. “The activist judicial machinery in Pennsylvania continues to cover up the allegations of massive fraud.”

Pennsylvania certified Biden, who won the state by 80,000 votes, as its winner this week. Under Pennsylvania law, the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state gets all of the state’s 20 electoral votes.

Trump, a Republican, has refused to concede to his Democratic rival and continues to claim, without evidence, widespread voter fraud.

But as his legal challenges to the results fail, Trump said on Thursday he will leave the White House if the Electoral College votes for Biden when it meets on Dec. 14, the closest he has come to conceding the election.

On Monday, Trump’s administration cleared the way Biden to transition to the White House, giving him access to briefings and funding even as Trump vowed to continue fighting the election results.

Biden won the election 306-232 in electoral votes, including Pennsylvania’s 20. Even if Trump overturned the outcome in Pennsylvania, he would still need to reverse the result in at least two other states to remain as president.

TIME RUNNING OUT

While Trump and his supporters continue to wage legal battles, time is running out as states as states have until Dec. 8 to resolve election disputes.

Legal experts have said the cases have no chance of success and may be aimed at undermining confidence in the election. Polls have showed a majority of Republicans believe Trump won the election and many believe the election was tainted, despite a lack of evidence.

Soon after Friday’s ruling, Trump posted a video from Newsmax on Twitter about alleged voter fraud in Nevada.

The Trump campaign filed the Pennsylvania case earlier this month, saying that county election officials had treated mail-in ballots inconsistently and asking U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann to halt certification of the results.

Some counties had allowed voters to fix minor deficiencies with their ballots, such as a missing “secrecy envelope,” while others did not.

Brann dismissed the case on Nov. 21, saying the case was based on “strained legal arguments” and “speculative accusations.”

The Trump campaign said it appealed on the “narrow” question of whether Brann improperly refused to let it amend the lawsuit a second time.

The campaign wants to add back allegations it dropped from the case, including a claim that its due process rights were violated.

The appeals court said many of the claims by Trump campaign are matters of Pennsylvania law but noted the campaign already lost on those issues in state court.

“It never alleges that anyone treated the Trump campaign or Trump votes worse than it treated the Biden campaign or Biden votes,” said the opinion. “The campaign’s claims have no merit.”

The other judges on the panel, Brooks Smith and Michael Chagares, were nominated by George W. Bush, a Republican."

""Six months having elapsed, the U.S. withdrawal took effect on November 22, 2020, and the United States is no longer a State Party to the Treaty on Open Skies,"" Brown added.

The post-Cold War agreement was struck to allow nations to conduct flyovers of other allies in an attempt to collect military data and other intelligence on neighboring foreign enemies.

During his first term in office, Trump and his allies have boasted that they have been tougher on Russia in recent years than any previous administration, despite claims of an inappropriately friendly relationship between the president and his Russian counterpart.

In August, the Trump administration pulled out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, an agreement banning nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers that was signed in 1987.

At the time, the administration accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty after saying U.S. officials had ""tried everything possible since May 2013” to stop Russia from building up its nuclear capability.

LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca is working with regulators to investigate a lower dosage of its vaccine that performed better than a full dosage, a spokesman for the company said, after its chief executive was quoted as saying an additional global trial was likely.

Asked about the Bloomberg report on the additional trial, a spokesman for AstraZeneca said: “As we communicated earlier this week, there is strong merit in continuing to further investigate the half-dose/full dose regimen.”

“We are further evaluating the data and will work with regulators on the best approach for further evaluation. This would add to data from existing trials which are currently being prepared for regulatory submission,” he said."
"In a 5-4 ruling, Supreme Court sides with religious groups in a dispute over Covid-19 restrictions in New York",311,k1gmvw,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/26/politics/supreme-court-religious-restrictions-ruling-covid/index.html,77,1606431656.0,,"(CNN) In a 5-4 ruling, the US Supreme Court sided with religious organizations in a dispute over Covid-19 restrictions put in place by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo limiting the number of people attending religious services.

The case is the latest pitting religious groups against city and state officials seeking to stop the spread of Covid-19 , and it highlights the impact of Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the court. The decision comes as coronavirus cases surge across the country.

In the late-night decision, Barrett sided with her conservative colleagues in the dispute, while Chief Justice John Roberts joined the three liberal justices in dissent.

Last spring and summer, before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court split 5-4 on similar cases out of California and Nevada, with Roberts and the liberals in the majority siding against houses of worship. Barrett was confirmed in October to take Ginsburg's seat.

Ruling says houses of worship face 'far more restrictive' regulations

The ruling , released just before midnight on Thanksgiving eve, contains several separate opinions and some unusually critical language.

In the main, unsigned opinion, the majority ruled in favor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Agudath Israel of America that argued that the restrictions violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because the regulations treated the houses of worship more harshly than comparable secular facilities.

The majority said that the regulations are ""far more restrictive than any Covid-related regulations that have previously come before the court, much tighter than those adopted by many other jurisdictions hard hit by the pandemic, and far more severe than has been shown to be required to prevent the spread of the virus"" at the religious services in question.

The restrictions on attendance are divided up by geographic zones in areas classified as ""red"" or ""orange"" zones.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn issued a statement Thursday morning applauding the court's decision, saying that they are gratified and appreciate the court's recognition of a ""clear First Amendment violation and urgent need for relief in this case.""

""I have said from the beginning the restrictions imposed by Governor Cuomo were an overreach that did not take into account the size of our churches or the safety protocols that have kept parishioners safe,"" Reverend Nicholas DiMarzio, Bishop of Brooklyn, said in a statement.

Agudath Israel of America similarly celebrated the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in their favor.

""This is an historic victory,"" Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel, Executive Vice President of Agudath Israel, said in a statement. ""This landmark decision will ensure that religious practices and religious institutions will be protected from government edicts that do not treat religion with the respect demanded by the Constitution.""

In court papers, lawyers for Cuomo argued that the restrictions were necessary to help stop the spread of Covid-19 and that houses of worship weren't being treated differently than similar secular businesses. They also said that while the dispute was pending, Cuomo had already lifted any restrictions that applied to the organizations.

""Not only is there no evidence that the applicants have contributed to the spread of COVID-19 but there are many other less restrictive rules that could be adopted to minimize the risk to those attending religious services,"" the Court held.

""Members of this Court are not public health experts, and we should respect the judgment of those with special expertise and responsibility in this area,"" the court said. ""But even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.""

The court said that even though Cuomo had lifted some restrictions, the houses of worship ""remain under a constant threat"" because the restrictions could always be reinstated.

Lower courts had sided with Cuomo.

Cuomo said Thursday that the ruling was in essence the court ""making a statement that it's a different court.""

""The basic point is you know why does the court rule on an issue that is moot unless -- and which they had just decided several months before in other cases..which presented the same argument -- why rule on a case that is moot and come up with a different decision than you did several months ago on the same issue? You have a different court and I think that was the statement that the court was making,"" Cuomo said.

Lawyers for the diocese had told the justices in court papers that the ""pandemic alone cannot justify overbroad, untailored closure orders of indefinite duration directed at all houses of worship, that in another time would plainly be found to violate the Constitution.""

And lawyers for the Agudath Israel of America said that the governor has specifically targeted Orthodox Jews who have ""violated his prior rules.""

""The Governor's guilt-by-religious-association restrictions have made it impossible for Applicants and their members to exercise their religious faith,"" they argued.

6 opinions in the late-night ruling

In all, the late-night ruling consisted of six different opinions.

Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote his own concurrence -- joined by no other justice -- to explain his vote.

He said that other businesses such as bicycle repair shops, did not have similar restrictions.

""So, at least according to the Governor, it may be unsafe to go to church, but it is always fine to pick up another bottle of wine"" or ""shop for a new bike,"" Gorsuch wrote.

He was critical of the reasoning of a decision penned by Roberts in May rejecting a request from a church in California to block limitations on the number of people who could attend religious services during the pandemic.

Gorsuch said the court precedent Roberts cited in that decision ""hardly supports cutting the Constitution loose during a pandemic.""

For his part, Roberts said he was in dissent because while ""it may well be that such restrictions violate the Free Exercise Clause,"" Cuomo had revised the restrictions after the religious organizations had filed their challenge.

""It is a significant matter to override determinations made by public health officials concerning what is necessary for public safety in the midst of a deadly pandemic,"" Roberts wrote, and said that the houses of worship could have returned to court if Cuomo had reversed himself.

But Roberts -- who often works to keep the court out of the political fray and divisive atmosphere that has dominated the other branches of government -- had stern words for Gorsuch's criticism of the dissenters' reasoning.

""They simply view the matter differently after careful study and analysis reflecting their best efforts to fulfill their responsibility under the Constitution,"" he said.

He also pointedly defended his own reasoning in the case from May.

Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, said that the regulations were designed to ""fight the rapidly spreading -- and, in many cases, fatal -- COVID-19 virus,"" and that they allowed the governor to identity hot spots where the virus had spiked. Breyer noted the grisly statistics concerning the virus that has infected more than 12 million Americans and is currently surging. ""The Constitution principally entrusts the safety and the health of the people to the politically accountable officials of the States,"" Breyer wrote."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday, ending a yearslong prosecution in the Russia investigation that saw Flynn twice plead guilty to lying to the FBI and then reverse himself before the Justice Department stepped in to dismiss his case.

“It is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon,” Trump tweeted. “Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!”

The pardon, in the waning weeks of Trump’s single term, is part of a broader effort by Trump to undo the results of a Russia investigation that shadowed his administration and yielded criminal charges against a half-dozen associates. It comes just months after the president commuted the sentence of another associate, Roger Stone, days before he was to report to prison.

A Justice Department official said the department was not consulted on the pardon and learned Wednesday of the plan. But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, noted that the president has the legal power to pardon Flynn.

The move is likely to energize supporters who have taken up Flynn as a cause celebre and rallied around the retired Army lieutenant general as the victim of what they assert is an unfair prosecution, even though Flynn twice admitted guilt. Trump has repeatedly spoken warmly about Flynn and, in an indication of his personal interest in his fate, asked then-FBI Director James Comey in February 2017 to end a criminal investigation into the national security adviser.

In a statement, Flynn’s family thanked Trump “for answering our prayers and the prayers of a nation” by issuing the pardon.

Democrats lambasted the pardon as undeserved and unprincipled. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it “an act of grave corruption and a brazen abuse of power,” while Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said a “pardon by Trump does not erase” the truth of Flynn’s guilty plea, “no matter how Trump and his allies try to suggest otherwise.”

“The President’s enablers have constructed an elaborate narrative in which Trump and Flynn are victims and the Constitution is subject to the whims of the president,” House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler said in a statement. “Americans soundly rejected this nonsense when they voted out President Trump. ”

The pardon is the final step in a case defined by twists and turns. The most dramatic came in May when the Justice Department abruptly moved to dismiss the case , insisting that Flynn should not have been interviewed by the FBI in the first place, only to have U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan resist the request and appoint a former judge to argue against the federal government’s position and to evaluate whether Flynn should be held in criminal contempt for perjury.

That former judge, John Gleeson, called the Justice Department’s dismissal request an abuse of power and said its grounds for dropping the case were ever-evolving and “patently pretextual.”

As Sullivan declined to immediately dismiss the prosecution, Flynn lawyer Sidney Powell sought to bypass the judge by asking a federal appeals court to direct him to drop the matter. A three-judge panel did exactly that, but the full court overturned that decision and sent the case back to Sullivan.

At a hearing in September, Powell told Sullivan that she had discussed Flynn’s case with Trump but also said she did not want a pardon — presumably because she wanted him to be vindicated in the courts.

Powell emerged separately in recent weeks as a public face of Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden, but the Trump legal team distanced itself from her after she advanced a series of uncorroborated conspiracy claims.

The pardon spares Flynn the possibility of any prison sentence, which Sullivan could potentially have imposed had he ultimately rejected the Justice Department’s dismissal request. That request was made after a review of the case by a federal prosecutor from St. Louis who had been specially appointed by Attorney General William Barr.

At issue in the prosecution was an FBI interview of Flynn, days after Trump’s inauguration, about a conversation he had during the presidential transition period with the then-Russian ambassador.

Flynn acknowledged lying during that interview by saying he had not discussed with the diplomat, Sergey Kislyak, sanctions that the outgoing Obama administration had just been imposed on Russia for election interference. During that conversation, Flynn advised that Russia be “even-keeled” in response to the punitive measures, and assured him “we can have a better conversation” about relations between the countries after Trump became president.

The conversation alarmed the FBI, which at the time was investigating whether the Trump campaign and Russia had coordinated to sway the election. In addition, White House officials were stating publicly that Flynn and Kislyak had not discussed sanctions, which the FBI knew was untrue.

Flynn was ousted from his position in February 2017 after news broke that Obama administration officials had warned the White House that Flynn had indeed discussed sanctions with Kislyak and was vulnerable to blackmail. He pleaded guilty months later to a false statement charge.

But last May, after years of defending the prosecution, the Justice Department abruptly reversed its position.

It asserted the FBI had no basis to interview Flynn about Kislyak and that any statements he made during the interview were not material to the FBI’s broader counterintelligence probe. The department also pointed to internal FBI notes showing agents had planned to close out the investigation weeks before interviewing Flynn about Kislyak.

Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, was among the first people charged in Mueller’s investigation and provided such extensive cooperation that prosecutors did not recommend any prison time, leaving open the possibility of probation.

But the morning he was to have been sentenced, after a stern rebuke about his behavior from Sullivan, Flynn asked for the hearing to be cut short so that he could continue cooperating and earn credit toward a more lenient sentence.

After that, he hired new attorneys — including Powell, a conservative commentator and outspoken critic of Mueller’s investigation — who took a far more confrontational stance to the government and tried to withdraw his guilty plea."

WASHINGTON (AP) — As the ravages of the novel coronavirus forced millions of people out of work, shuttered businesses and shrank the value of retirement accounts, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged to a three-year low.

But for Sen. David Perdue, a Georgia Republican, the crisis last March signaled something else: a stock buying opportunity.

And for the second time in less than two months, Perdue’s timing was impeccable. He avoided a sharp loss and reaped a stunning gain by selling and then buying the same stock: Cardlytics, an Atlanta-based financial technology company on whose board of directors he once served.

ADVERTISEMENT

On Jan. 23, as word spread through Congress that the coronavirus posed a major economic and public health threat, Perdue sold off $1 million to $5 million in Cardlytics stock at $86 a share, according to congressional disclosures.

Weeks later, in March, after the company’s stock plunged following an unexpected leadership shakeup and lower-than-forecast earnings, Perdue bought the stock back for $30 a share, investing between $200,000 and $500,000.

Those shares have now quadrupled in value, closing at $121 a share on Tuesday.

The Cardlytics transactions were just a slice of a large number of investment decisions made in the early days of the pandemic by Perdue and other senators. They stirred public outrage after it became clear that some members of Congress had been briefed on the economic and health threat the virus posed. The transactions were mentioned briefly in a story published by the Intercept in May.

Now that Perdue is locked in a pitched battle for reelection in a Jan. 5 runoff , his trades during a public health and economic crisis have become an issue in what already has become a negative, expensive campaign that will determine which party controls the Senate .

There is no definitive proof that Perdue, who is among the wealthier members of the Senate, acted on information gained as a member of Congress or through his long-standing relationship with company officials. It’s illegal to use nonpublic information gained as a company insider or member of Congress to make investment decisions.

ADVERTISEMENT

But legal experts say the timing of his sale, the fact that he quickly bought Cardlytics stock back when it had lost two-thirds of its market value and his close ties to company officials all warrant scrutiny.

“This does seem suspicious,” said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law school professor who specializes in corporate and securities issues. But he added, “You need more than suspicions to convict.”

The Perdue campaign declined a request for an interview with the senator. In a statement, Perdue spokesperson John Burke said the senator had been cleared of wrongdoing but did not provide details.

“The bi-partisan Senate Ethics Committee, DOJ and SEC all independently and swiftly cleared Senator Perdue months ago, which was reported on,” Burke said.

Perdue’s opponent, Democrat Jon Ossoff, has seized on his stock trading while trying to brand him as a “crook.”

Perdue is not the only senator on the ballot in Georgia. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, also a Republican, is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock in a bid to complete the remainder of retired Sen. Johnny Isakson’s term .

Perdue’s Cardlytics transactions fit into a broader pattern of stock moves he made when the coronavirus first struck the U.S.

At the time, Perdue publicly maintained that the economy was strong and praised President Donald Trump during a Feb. 24 interview on Fox News Channel for “executing the greatest economic turnaround in U.S. history.”

A series of swift transactions in his portfolio told a different story, however, showing the senator dumped some company stocks, while investing in others — like protective equipment maker DuPont and pharmaceutical company Pfizer — that were poised to do well during the pandemic.

Perdue has previously said that outside financial advisers make most of his trades.

But Donna Nagy, an Indiana University law professor, said that type of arrangement doesn’t preclude Perdue from directing an adviser to make specific transactions. She said one way for members of Congress to avoid questions about their financial holdings is to put them in a blind trust, which Perdue has not done.

“All of these questions about the motivations behind our members of Congress and their personal securities trading could be alleviated if Congress passed a law that limited investments,” said Nagy, who specializes in securities law. “Ordinary citizens should not have to question members of Congress about their investments.”

The issue was enough of a liability that Perdue abruptly sold off between $3.2 million and $9.4 million of his stock portfolio over a four-day period in mid-April, according to an Associated Press review of mandatory financial disclosures he has submitted to the Senate. He did not sell his stock in Cardlytics.

Still, Perdue has largely avoided the same degree of scrutiny faced by some of his colleagues.

Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina drew the most attention and stepped down as Senate Intelligence Committee chair amid a probe of his sale of upward of $1.7 million in stock, which came when he was privately warning some well-heeled constituents about the virus while publicly downplaying the threat.

Cardlytics works at the intersection of banking and online marketing. It helps run rewards programs for financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, using data the banks have gathered on their customers to market to them — similar to what Facebook does with targeted ads.

The company did not respond to a request for comment.

After the March turmoil, its share price dramatically rebounded. Lynne Laube, Cardlytics’ current CEO, said the pandemic had a lot to do with it, driving consumer interest in savings programs.

“I hate to say this pandemic is playing in our favor, but it’s playing in our favor,” she said during an earnings call in May.

Perdue acquired 75,000 shares in Cardlytics through stock options offered for his service on the company’s board from 2010 to 2014, when he stepped down after winning his Senate seat, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. The company, which at the time had not yet gone public, also offered him options that would become available in October 2020 and January 2022.

Perdue’s latest financial disclosures do not indicate whether he has exercised the options that became available in October.

But according to Coffee, the Columbia University law professor, it’s an unusual move by the company.

“I’ve never seen options extended from 2014 to 2022,” he said. “That’s a very long extension.”

While Perdue left the company’s board, he has maintained ties to some of its executives, who have donated more than $30,000 to his political committees. Donations made to Perdue account for nearly 80% of all giving to federal candidates by Cardlytics employees over the past decade, records show.

Perdue, meanwhile, has used social media to publicize the company. In August 2016, he took a tour of its office and posed for a photo with Laube and then-CEO Scott Grimes, which he posted to Facebook. In fall 2019, he introduced Laube and Grimes at a gala in Atlanta, where they received a business achievement award.

Isakson, who served with Perdue, took steps to avoid the type of scrutiny Perdue is now facing. Isakson, a Republican, put most of his own holdings in a blind trust after some of his assets drew unwanted attention in 2012.

“I said I need to be as patently pure and patently clean as anybody, and the best way to do that is a blind trust,” Isakson, who served on the Senate’s finance and ethics committees, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution in 2017. “I don’t know what I own.”"
27 veterans die in COVID-19 outbreak at Illinois VA home,411,k0uvyl,https://apnews.com/article/veterans-coronavirus-pandemic-nursing-homes-illinois-a69895fece8c5adb5ef4327e04ee0220,9,1606349223.0,,"LASALLE, Ill. (AP) — State officials are investigating a coronavirus outbreak at a veterans nursing home in rural Illinois that has infected nearly 200 residents and staff, and killed 27 veterans.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office and the state’s Department of Veterans Affairs are attempting to determine what caused the outbreak at the state-run LaSalle Veterans Home in LaSalle, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) southwest of Chicago.

The department on Tuesday requested an independent probe into the facility, which was the focus of a state Senate committee virtual hearing on the outbreak.

“The tragedy of what has unfolded at the veterans’ home cannot be understated,” said state Sen. Sue Rezin, who represents the district where the home is located. “I’m glad that the director has called for an independent investigation and agree that there are lesson to be learned from this terrible outbreak that has claimed the lives of 27 of our nation’s heroes.”

The current outbreak was identified in late October when a staff member and a resident tested positive for the virus. Since the beginning of November, two-thirds of residents and employees have tested positive, according to the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs.

“November 4th, there were only four cases of COVID within the home,” Rezin said Monday. “Very quickly within the past 20 days, we’ve had almost 200 cases.”

Dr. Avery Hart, a consultant for the state’s Public Health department, said at the hearing that all 16 long-term care facilities in LaSalle County have had outbreaks.

“It is no coincidence that cases within the home began to rise just as cases rose dramatically within the surrounding community,” Veterans Affairs Director Linda Chapa LaVia testified Tuesday at the hearing.

State officials have increased staff testing at the facility, and the governor said an infection control team was sent to the home. As of Tuesday morning, 40 of 101 residents and 24 staff members had tested positive for the virus.

Also Tuesday, the state’s health director said Illinois will receive far fewer doses of the COVID-19 vaccine than originally estimated. Dr. Ngozi Ezike told reporters that she expects the state to receive about 80,000 initial doses instead of the 400,000 doses that Illinois officials had anticipated, pending FDA approval of the vaccines.

She also said she still expects health care and emergency workers who could come into direct contact with coronavirus patients to be vaccinated first."
Trump pops into White House briefing room for one-minute impromptu speech,9,k0ex2a,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/24/trump-briefing-impromptu-speech-440321,13,1606284391.0,,"The appearance lasted just over a minute, and reporters were given hardly any notice, showing the hastiness of the remarks.

The index had hovered near that mark earlier this month amid news that vaccines for coronavirus demonstrated effectiveness and could soon receive emergency authorization. The market crested Tuesday after the GSA administrator the night before cleared the way for President-elect Joe Biden to begin coordinating with the government he will take over in January.

""I'm very thrilled with what has happened on the vaccine front,” Trump said, with Vice President Mike Pence by his side. “That’s been absolutely incredible.”

The appearance was not on the president’s schedule until moments before he showed up, and Trump took no questions from the press before exiting the room.

The index stayed above the 30,000 mark for much of the day and closed at 30,046 — up more than 450 points over the previous day. However, a separate, closely watched indicator — U.S. consumer confidence — sagged in November, according to figures released on Tuesday, painting a more nuanced picture of the economy as coronavirus rages across much of the country.

Later in the afternoon, Trump held the annual turkey-pardoning ceremony , a typically lighthearted event the president has seemingly reveled in over his prior three years in office.

“Thanksgiving is a very special day for turkeys,” Trump said from White House Rose Garden during the event. “Not a very good one, when you think about it.”"

While some Seattle activists had demanded a 50-percent police budget deduction, Mayor Jenny Durkan said she backs these lesser cuts, calling them ""thoughtful and deliberate"" and saying the city will prioritize ""what services we need from the Seattle Police Department and how we can scale up alternatives to policing.""

“I believe we are laying the groundwork to make systemic and lasting changes to policing,"" Durkan said in a statement. ""We have rightly put forward a plan that seeks to ensure SPD has enough officers to meet 911 response and investigative needs throughout the city, while acknowledging and addressing the disproportionate impacts policing has had on communities of color, particularly Black communities.""

Durkan is expected to formally sign the 2021 budget into law next week, a City Hall spokeswoman said Tuesday.

Council member Teresa Mosqueda, who heads the the budget committee, said it was a top priority to ""downsize the SPD’s budget"" and move money to other social programs that will ""invest in community alternatives that produce healthy outcomes for"" minority communities.

She cited the police slayings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville as key moments that moved Seattle residents.

""We have much more work to do, and we must get to work on those next steps now,"" Mosqueda said.

The union representing Seattle officers decried the budget cutbacks and claimed that law enforcement services across the board would be hampered.

""You're going to see longer, if not hardly any follow-up investigations relative to secondary piece of a 911 call for help,"" Seattle Police Officers Guild President Mike Sloan said.

The tense, ongoing talks to slash the department budget led to the resignation of Carmen Best, who had been Seattle's first Black police chief.

Under the new spending plan, dozens of department vacancies will not be filled, overtime will be slashed and 911 dispatching and parking enforcement will be moved away from SPD control."
"Mattis Calls on Biden to Scrap 'America First' Policy, Slow Pullout from Afghanistan",26,k06fl3,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/11/24/mattis-calls-biden-scrap-america-first-policy-slow-pullout-afghanistan.html,5,1606258492.0,,"Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has broken his silence on the election with a public call to President-elect Joe Biden to alter the course of current defense policy.

Alongside three co-authors, Mattis published a piece in Foreign Affairs on Monday warning against abrupt departure from Afghanistan and calling for the elimination of ""America First"" as a tenet of defense strategy.

""To dismiss U.S. involvement today in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere as 'endless' or 'forever' wars -- as both President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden do -- rather than as support to friendly governments struggling to exert control over their own territory misses the point,"" Mattis and his co-authors wrote. ""It is in the United States' interests to build the capacity of such governments to deal with the threats that concern Americans.""

As defense secretary, Mattis was the main architect of the National Defense Strategy, which directed the military to prepare for potential conflict with Russia and China. But Mattis and the others urged Biden and his new national security team to give the NDS a major rewrite and soften the confrontational tone.

""In January, when President Joe Biden and his national security team begin to reevaluate U.S. foreign policy, we hope they will quickly revise the national security strategy to eliminate 'America first' from its contents, restoring in its place the commitment to cooperative security that has served the United States so well for decades,"" the authors wrote.

Mattis was joined by Kori Schake, a long-time collaborator and now director of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute; retired Adm. Jim Ellis, former head of U.S. Strategic Command; and Joe Felter, a West Point graduate and Special Forces veteran of Afghanistan who now serves as a fellow at the Hoover Institution.

Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Nov. 9 shortly after Esper called for tighter cooperation with allies. Esper's acting replacement, Christopher C. Miller, has announced plans to draw down U.S. troops to 2,500 in Afghanistan and 2,500 in Iraq by Jan. 15.

This move must be reevaluated, the four authors said.

""Enhancing national security must start with the fundamental truth that the United States cannot protect itself or its interests without the help of others,"" Mattis and his co-authors wrote.

Mattis, a retired Marine general and former head of U.S. Central Command, resigned as defense secretary in December 2018, although Trump later said he was fired.

The immediate cause of Mattis' resignation was Trump's surprise announcement that all U.S. troops in Syria should be withdrawn.

In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote: ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held. Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""

The Foreign Affairs article expanded on views expressed in Mattis' resignation letter.

""Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the 2017 National Defense Strategy described an international environment of increased global disorder, long-term strategic competition, rapid dispersion of technologies, and eroding U.S. military advantage,"" the authors wrote.

""The United States today is undermining the foundations of an international order manifestly advantageous to U.S. interests, reflecting a basic ignorance of the extent to which both robust alliances and international institutions provide vital strategic depth.""

In practice, they added, ""America first"" has meant ""America alone,"" making the nation more vulnerable to emerging threats.

""As capable as the U.S. military is, the United States' principal adversaries are more constrained by its network of alliances than by its military might,"" they wrote.

The article urged the new Biden administration to show more deference to allies' concerns in joining with the U.S. to face global challenges.

""Advocates of the current administration's approach seem to believe that other countries will have no choice but to accede to the United States' wishes and cooperate on its terms. This is delusion,"" the article said.

The authors also urged the Biden administration to seek areas of cooperation with China, the U.S.' major competitor, while facing down the threat to avoid war.

The goal of the U.S. should ""not only be to deter great-power war but to seek great-power peace and cooperation in advancing shared interests. For that, the United States' alliances and partnerships are especially crucial,"" the authors wrote.

The author's concerns about a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan have also been expressed by some Trump supporters.

Retired Gen. Jack Keane, the former Army vice chief of staff and a Vietnam veteran, said he has had discussions with Trump and Army Gen. Austin Scott Miller, commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, on the risks posed by drawing down in Afghanistan at the planned scale.

Keane said he expressed his concerns to Miller when the U.S. reduced its troop presence in Afghanistan from 8,000 to 4,500 over the summer.

""And I asked him, because I do have contact with him, I said, 'Scotty, I mean, that's kind of low,'"" Keane said in an American Enterprise Institute podcast Nov. 19.

He said Miller replied: ""I've got people here I really don't need. I want to get them out of here because they're not contributing overall to success; it's just nice to have. This is the lowest I can go and still maintain essential missions.""

While disagreeing with the drawdown to 2,500 troops, Keane said Trump had stopped short of his initial impulse to order a complete withdrawal.

""I know that, from my own interactions with him on the subject, and I know as recently as last week, he still wanted to pull out of Afghanistan and he had people telling him, largely the new people brought into the Pentagon, telling him that we can get down to zero,"" said Keane, chairman of the Institute for the Study of War.

""And certainly he was inclined to do that, but he didn't do it.""

First on CNN: GSA tells Biden that transition can formally begin,286,jztcj5,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/23/politics/transition-biden-gsa-begin/index.html,63,1606203312.0,,"(CNN) The General Services Administration has informed President-elect Joe Biden that the Trump administration is ready to begin the formal transition process, according to a letter from Administrator Emily Murphy sent Monday afternoon and obtained by CNN.

The letter is the first step the administration has taken to acknowledge President Donald Trump's defeat, more than two weeks after Biden was declared the winner in the election

""Please know that I came to my decision independently, based on the law and available facts,"" Murphy wrote. ""I was never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official -- including those who work at the White House or GSA -- with regard to the substance or timing of my decision. To be clear, I did not receive any direction to delay my determination.""

The letter marks Murphy's formal sign off on Biden's victory, a normally perfunctory process known as ascertainment. The move will allow the transition to officially begin, permitting current administration agency officials to coordinate with the incoming Biden team, and providing millions in government funding for the transition.

A major step toward the Biden administration

The Biden team has not waited for the formal transition process to begin preparing for the presidency, as Biden announced several Cabinet picks on Monday . But the delay in ascertainment meant that Biden's team was locked out from government data and could not make contact with federal agencies, nor could it spend $6.3 million in government funding now available for the transition. A Biden official said the most urgent need was for the transition to be given access to Covid-19 data and the vaccine distribution plans.

The Biden team will now have access to additional office space inside the agencies and the ability to use federal resources for background checks on Biden's White House staff appointments and Cabinet picks.

Yohannes Abraham, executive director of Biden's transition, said the start of the transition was a ""needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track.""

""This final decision is a definitive administrative action to formally begin the transition process with federal agencies,"" Abraham said. ""In the days ahead, transition officials will begin meeting with federal officials to discuss the pandemic response, have a full accounting of our national security interests and gain complete understanding of the Trump administration's efforts to hollow out government agencies.""

States certify results as Trump's legal strategy collapsing

The ascertainment letter was sent Monday after Michigan formally certified its election results earlier in the day and more Trump lawsuits were dismissed. Georgia certified its razor-thin presidential results on Friday, and Pennsylvania is nearing certification of its election results, too.

It's the latest sign that Trump's conspiracy-laden legal bid, led by Rudy Giuliani, to circumvent the outcome of the election is nearing an end. The Trump campaign's lawsuits to delay certification of the election have been dismissed in multiple states, as his legal team has failed to provide any evidence of widespread voter fraud.

But until now, Murphy had refused to move forward with the ascertainment process, despite Biden's clear victory. Murphy, a Trump political appointee, has faced intense scrutiny and political pressure from Democrats and, in recent days, Republicans calling for the start of a smooth transition. In a statement Monday, Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said that ""there is no evidence as of now of any widespread fraud or irregularities that would change the result in any state"" and called on the transition process to begin.

In the letter, Murphy suggested that the ascertainment rules were vague and should be updated.

""GSA does not dictate the outcome of legal disputes and recounts, nor does it determine whether such proceedings are reasonable or justified,"" she wrote. ""These are issues that the Constitution, federal laws, and state laws leave to the election certification process and decisions by courts of competent jurisdiction. I do not think that an agency charged with improving federal procurement and property management should place itself above the constitutionally-based election process. I strongly urge Congress to consider amendments to the Act.""

Trump tweeted moments after the letter was reported, thanking Murphy for her work and affirming the decision to start the transition.

""I want to thank Emily Murphy at GSA for her steadfast dedication and loyalty to our Country. She has been harassed, threatened, and abused -- and I do not want to see this happen to her, her family, or employees of GSA. Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good fight, and I believe we will prevail!"" Trump tweeted. ""Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.""

Two Trump advisers said the President's tweets are being read by people in his orbit as essentially a concession.

""A veiled attempt to justify continued fundraising solicitations,"" the second adviser said.

However, late on Monday night Trump attempted to soothe fears among his supporters by tweeting he wasn't conceding and cited multiple debunked conspiracy theories.

""What does GSA being allowed to preliminarily work with the Dems have to do with continuing to pursue our various cases on what will go down as the most corrupt election in American political history?"" Trump tweeted. ""We are moving full speed ahead.""

GSA in the spotlight

The General Services Administration informed federal departments on Monday night that it has ascertained Biden to be the winner of the presidential election, according to an email obtained by CNN.

""In accordance with the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended, today, November 23, 2020, the GSA Administrator has ascertained Joseph R. Biden and Senator Kamala Harris the apparent successful candidates for the offices of President and Vice President, respectively,"" Mary Gibert, the federal transition coordinator, wrote in an email to federal department contacts.

A senior White House official said some staffers were initially caught off guard by the GSA letter, learning about it first from CNN. But the official said staffers will begin to cooperate with the Biden transition team, adding that they were seeking more information on next steps.

White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows notified West Wing staff in an email Monday night that the transition process was formally underway.

""As you may have seen, the GSA Administrator has made an ascertainment to allow for the start of a Presidential transition,"" Meadows wrote in an email shown to CNN. ""I want to remind all EOP employees of existing procedures and guidance that we must adhere to throughout this Administration.""

""Our work here is not finished,"" he added.

Meadows cited the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 and noted that the executive office of the President must adhere to communications guidelines and records guidelines. Meadows said he had appointed liaisons in each office to be the point of contact and said that person should deal with the incoming team.

""Unless specifically authorized EOP personnel are not permitted to speak directly with a member of the Biden Transition Team or the Federal Transition Coordinator,"" Meadows wrote in bolded letters.

For two weeks after the election was called for Biden, Murphy was silent as the ascertainment delay dragged on, sparking public pressure from congressional Democrats and Biden himself, who warned that the delay could cost lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Democrats were demanding a briefing from Murphy on Tuesday to explain her decision-making, rejecting the GSA's proposal earlier Monday for her deputy to brief Congress next week. Democratic committee chairmen sent a slew of new letters to Murphy on Tuesday demanding she allow the transition to begin and warning of the consequences for failing to do so.

"Trump axed campaign lawyer Sidney Powell because 'she was too conspiratorial even for him,' report says",367,jzkyxg,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-lost-patience-with-conspiracy-theorist-attorney-powell-nyt-2020-11,37,1606178195.0,,"The Trump campaign on Sunday announced it was parting ways with the attorney Sidney Powell.

Powell's wild conspiracy theories proved too much even for President Donald Trump, according to reports, as his campaign to overturn the election result in the courts descended last week into farce.

Powell has alleged a vast plot by communists, the financier George Soros, and GOP officials in Georgia to steal the election from Trump. She has provided no convincing evidence to back the claims.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

When President Donald Trump on November 15 announced the legal team leading his campaign to overturn the result of the presidential election, among them the Dallas attorney Sidney Powell, he described the members as a ""truly great team.""

But only a week later, the Trump campaign abruptly distanced itself from Powell. The attorney's outlandish conspiracy theories apparently became too much even for a president whose political identity is founded on stirring suspicion of ""deep state"" elites.

Sources close to the president told The New York Times' Maggie Haberman that Powell's claims had become too much for Trump and that for days the president had been ""agitating"" about Powell and Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor leading the Trump campaign's challenge in the courts.

A particular focus of his ire was said to be last Thursday's bizarre press conference, where Powell aired the wild conspiracy theory — with no evidence — that Venezuelan socialists and the Jewish financier George Soros had orchestrated a vast plot using rigged voting machines to steal the election from Trump.

""She was too conspiratorial even for him,"" one Trump adviser told Haberman.

Another tipping point was apparently a federal judge's rejection on Saturday of the Trump campaign's challenge to the election result in Pennsylvania, a rejection that included withering criticism of the legal case made by the campaign's attorneys.

A Trump campaign official echoed the assessment in remarks to the Los Angeles Times' legal-affairs columnist, Harry Litman.

In its courtroom presentations, where stating deliberate falsehoods can attract serious legal penalties, the Trump campaign has notably declined to air the more incendiary claims made by figures such as Powell.

Powell is no stranger to stirring conspiracy theories in her defense of clients.

As the attorney for Michael Flynn, the former White House national security advisor, she promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory, whose adherents groundlessly believe that a ""deep state"" cabal of child-abusing Hollywood stars and Democrats are secretly plotting against Trump and his allies.

Comments to the far-right news organization Newsmax only two days after Thursday's press conference attracted criticism even from the president's allies.

In the interview, Powell claimed that top Republican officials in Georgia, including Gov. Brian Kemp, were part of a plot to fix the election.

""Georgia's probably going to be the first state I'm going to blow up and Mr. Kemp and the secretary of state need to go with it,"" she said, adding that her lawsuit would be ""biblical"" in its scale.

Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who has long advised Trump, was scathing on Sunday about the Trump campaign's faltering legal effort to overturn the election, describing the president's legal team to ABC News as a ""national embarrassment."" He singled out Powell's claims about Georgia GOP officials for criticism, describing her conduct as ""outrageous.""

In a statement released after the Trump campaign cut its ties with her, Powell refused to relent, pledging to submit an ""epic"" lawsuit this week containing evidence of the claims that have alienated her from the president's allies.

Powell didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment."
AstraZeneca says COVID-19 'vaccine for the world' can be 90% effective,202,jzj9g2,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-astrazeneca/refileupdate-5-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-can-be-90-effective-results-show-idUSL4N2I91B5,25,1606172882.0,,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Monday its COVID-19 vaccine was 70% effective in pivotal trials and could be up to 90% effective, giving the world’s fight against the global pandemic a third new weapon that can be cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale-up than rivals.

The British drugmaker said it will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, around four times as many as U.S. competitor Pfizer Inc. Seven hundred million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.

“This means we have a vaccine for the world,” said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford University vaccine group that developed the drug.

The vaccine on average prevented 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil. The success rate rose to 90% in a group of trial participants who accidentally received a half dose followed by a full dose. The efficacy was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most study participants.

No serious safety events were confirmed, the company said, although little safety data was provided.

AstraZeneca’s shares fell nearly 4%, as investors perceived the efficacy data as less impressive than rival vaccines and may take longer to get U.S regulatory approval. Pfizer and Moderna, which reported that their vaccines were about 95% effective in preventing illness, had set the success bar sky-high.

The AstraZeneca vaccine does have advantages.

Its cost to governments works out at just a few dollars a shot, a fraction of the price of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines using a new, more complex technology.

It can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute - especially in poor countries - than Pfizer’s, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C.

The 90% efficacy finding was a happy accident, AstraZeneca admitted, noting that it resulted from a dosing error during the trials. The half dose-first regimen will enable the company to seek approval based on far higher effectiveness than 62%, which was still enough for a regulatory nod based on prior discussions.

AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the smaller initial dose means limited supplies could stretch even further to vaccinate more people.

‘NOT A PANDEMIC WITHOUT END’

The faster roll-out means countries that had been drawing up plans to ration vaccines can distribute them more widely, helping to eventually halt the social and economic disruption of a pandemic that has killed 1.4 million people.

“Vaccines are now edging ever closer to liberating us from the virus, demonstrating emphatically that this is not a pandemic without end,” Britain Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Monday.

Matt Hancock, health secretary of Britain which has pre-ordered 100 million doses for its 67 million people, said the bulk of the vaccine rollout will take place January-March.

“We hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal,” he said.

In poor countries, where the logistics of distributing rival vaccines posed a bigger challenge, the effect of a cheaper and easier alternative could be even more pronounced.

“The big advantage of having the vaccine is that it can be stored, transported and handled at 2-8 degrees Celsius (35.6°-46.4°F) and we have that storage facility,” said Zahid Maleque, health minister of Bangladesh, which is buying in 30 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

The Philippines is close to concluding talks with AstraZeneca on the purchase of at least 20 million vaccine doses, a top coronavirus task force official said on Monday.

The World Health Organization’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the WHO is anxious to see full efficacy and safety data and encouraged other vaccine developers, saying vast quantities and a variety of shots will be needed.

“We have to cover ... billions and billions of people. We will need all the manufacturing capacity in the world in order to do that,” Swaminathan said.

‘WE’LL BE A LOT HAPPIER’

There was criticism of AstraZeneca’s data release.

Healthcare analysts from SVB Leerink said AstraZeneca had not disclosed enough information about safety events that led to a pause in the Phase III trials, and cited other study limitations.

Leerink noted that only a small number of people had received the smaller first dose.

Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges suggested the vaccine was unlikely to receive U.S. approval, noting the trials did not appear to meet U.S. requirements for representation of minorities, the elderly and other high-risk populations.

AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose.

Some scientists said all three vaccines could prove comparable in the end.

“I think it is a real fool’s errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of Phase III data from press releases,” said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London.

“My suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we’ll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we’ll be a lot happier.”

The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, a different approach from Pfizer and Moderna, which rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA).

AstraZeneca will now prepare regulatory submission of the data to regulators around the world and seek an emergency use listing from the WHO to speed up availability in poor countries."
"Biden Chooses Antony Blinken, Defender of Global Alliances, as Secretary of State",38,jz9dnv,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/us/politics/biden-antony-blinken-secretary-of-state.html,5,1606128752.0,,"Working with other countries, Mr. Blinken said at the forum, could have the added benefit of confronting another top diplomatic challenge: competing with China by choosing multilateral efforts to advance trade, technology investments and human rights — instead of forcing individual nations to choose between the two superpowers’ economies.

That is likely to mean diplomatic time spent forging stronger ties with India and across the Indo-Pacific region, where 14 nations recently signed one of the world’s largest free trade agreements with China. It could also bring an effort to deepen engagement across Africa, where China has made inroads with technology and infrastructure investments, and recognize Europe as a partner of “first resort, not last resort, when it comes to contending with the challenges we face,” Mr. Blinken said at the forum.

In public statements and interviews in recent weeks, he has made no secret of other aspects of Mr. Biden’s — and his own — agenda for the first weeks of the new presidency.

He will have about 15 days after inauguration to extend for five years the last major arms control agreement with Russia, a step Mr. Trump initially refused to take because he insisted China be brought into the treaty as well. “Certainly we will want to engage China on arms control issues,” Mr. Blinken said recently, “but we can pursue strategic stability by extending the New START arms limitation agreement and seek to build on it” later.

Mr. Blinken has turned more hawkish on Russia as the extent of its interference in the 2016 election and throughout Europe has become clearer. In a recent interview, he suggested using Russia’s discomfort with its reliance on China, especially in technology, for leverage.

“There’s a flip side” to dealing with Moscow, Mr. Blinken said. President Vladimir V. Putin, he noted, is “looking to relieve Russia’s growing dependence on China,” which has left him in “not a very comfortable position.”

In taking the White House’s top national security job, Mr. Sullivan will be the youngest person to hold that position since the Eisenhower administration. Mr. Sullivan made his name in the Obama administration, finding admirers even among conservative Republicans in Congress while playing a key role in the negotiations leading to the Iran nuclear deal in 2015."
Native American voters across Minnesota turned out to oust Trump,321,jz9a66,https://www.startribune.com/native-americans-showed-up-to-vote-and-had-an-impact/573156711/,13,1606128370.0,,"Life as a Native woman in rural Minnesota was never easy for Nancy Beaulieu, but it got harder after 2016.

She saw racial tensions between some white residents and Native Americans in her northern Minnesota community spill out into the open after the election of Donald Trump in 2016. In January, Beltrami County became one of the first in the nation to vote to ban refugees from resettling there. At a September rally in Bemidji, Minn., a mostly white crowd of thousands cheered when Trump looked out and praised their “good genes.”

Beaulieu, a member of the Leech Lake tribe, said they decided to start “playing the game of politics.” A team of organizers registered new Native American voters on nearby reservations, bused them to the polls and created regular radio programing to keep community members engaged.

It worked: Vote totals in four precincts around the Red Lake Reservation in Beltrami County went up between 22% and 45% from four years ago, and the votes in those precincts were cast more than 90% in favor of Joe Biden’s campaign for president, according to a Star Tribune analysis of state voting data. A similar pattern played out in precincts on or around Native American reservations across northern Minnesota — blips of deep blue in the middle of red Trump country. Vote totals across the state were up 11% from four years ago.

Biden won Minnesota by 7 points and came within 3 points of flipping Beltrami County after Trump won the county by 10 points four years ago.

“You know why they showed up? Trump,” said Beaulieu, a northern Minnesota organizer for clean-energy organization MN350. “They didn’t believe in the DFL Party. They didn’t believe Joe Biden was the best candidate for us. They wanted to vote against Trump.”

In other battleground states, Native American voters turned out in record numbers, including Arizona, where Biden leads Trump by 11,000 votes. Native voter turnout may have also tipped the scales in neighboring Wisconsin, where the National Congress of American Indians estimates there are about 71,000 voting-age Native Americans. Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes, pending a recount.

“The main word I hear about Indians is they’re invisible,” said Tadd Johnson, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota Duluth and the U’s first director of American Indian Tribal Nations Relations. “But this time they showed up and were totally visible at the polls. Their voting and their visibility made a difference.”

For organizers who work every year to turn out the Native vote, it’s a huge achievement, especially during a pandemic that has disproportionately affected Native American communities.

“It was definitely difficult due to the barriers,” said Clinton Fairbanks, who works in government relations with the Leech Lake tribe and helped drive voters to the polls. “There were a lot of people who were scared to vote this year. They didn’t want to go to the polls and they didn’t want to vote in person.”

Minnesota is home to 11 sovereign tribal nations and more than 114,000 people who identify as entirely or part Native American or Alaska Native, making up 2% of the state’s population. Nearly 40% of the state’s Native American population lives in the seven-county metro area, while others are spread out across rural areas in the state, including on reservations, according to data from the state demographer’s office.

In rural counties such as Beltrami, where more than 20% of the population is Native, their votes are critical for Democratic candidates in close races for Congress, the Legislature and local office.

Biden outperformed Hillary Clinton by a nearly 6-point margin in 51 Minnesota precincts where at least 25% of the population is Native, but that margin didn’t necessarily trickle down to local DFL candidates on the ballot, who lost competitive races for the state House and Senate near Bemidji. Democratic U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson was ousted by Republican Michelle Fischbach in the Seventh District. Republicans maintained narrow control of the state Senate and chipped away at Democrats’ majority in the House.

Ernest Joseph Oppegaard-Peltier III, a Native organizer who worked with MN350 this cycle, said there’s distrust between some Democrats on the state level and Native community members over environmental issues such as Enbridge Energy’s Line 3 pipeline replacement project, which was just issued a key water quality permit from the state. And Native candidates don’t always get the party’s backing to run for office, including Charles Dolson, an attorney who had been executive director of the Red Lake Nation. He lost the DFL endorsement this spring for a Bemidji-area seat in the state Senate.

“That’s the common thought in Native country here in the deep north,” Oppegaard-Peltier said. “We’ve been burnt so many times by the Democratic Party it’s hard for us to support the party itself.”

He said that feeling of distrust meant some of the Native community members he helped register to vote ultimately cast their ballots for Trump, who did some voter outreach in Native communities. Ivanka Trump traveled to Minnesota in July to open an office dedicated to investigating cases of missing and murdered Native Americans.

DFL Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth band who became the first Native woman elected to statewide office in 2018, said there’s natural distrust of government among Native communities, and no political party should assume they are guaranteed their support.

“It takes hard work,” she said. “There is a real opportunity here to spend the time over the next two years of building those intentional relationships with the Native community as we go into the next electoral cycle.”

There were bright spots for Native candidates: a record-breaking six Native American and Native Hawaiian candidates were elected to Congress this cycle. In Minnesota, Mary Kunesh-Podein, of Standing Rock Lakota descent, will become the first Native woman to serve in the state Senate in its more than 150-year history. Yankton Sioux Tribe member Heather Keeler of Moorhead will join Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn, DFL-Roseville, in the House.

On the local level, Audrey Thayer, a White Earth band member, won a Bemidji City Council seat, and Fond du Lac band member Lyz Jaakola won a seat on the City Council in Cloquet, Minn.

“Every year they kind of stack on each other,” said Keeler, who recently tweeted a picture of her moccasins planted on the floor of the Minnesota House. “A lot of people will stick to tribal government and they’ll step up in those spaces, but we have to blow the door open and say we’re here.

12 million Americans could lose crucial unemployment benefits just after Christmas,83,jyzjva,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/21/politics/unemployment-benefits-expiring-congress/index.html,6,1606095047.0,,"(CNN) With special pandemic unemployment benefits set to expire in the next few weeks, opera singer Brian Montgomery is making plans to leave the country.

Since March, Montgomery -- a New Yorker who also works as a voice teacher and tour guide -- has not been able to find steady work, but he's gotten weekly payments thanks to the historic expansion of benefits under the $2 trillion federal stimulus package. But now, with Congress stalled on a fresh relief deal, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program will run out just after Christmas.

Brian Montgomery, an out-of-work opera singer, voice teacher and tour guide, will have to move to Asia if Congress doesn't extend pandemic unemployment benefits by the end of the year.

If that happens, Montgomery and his wife, a part-time home health aide, might go to Japan, where Montgomery's wife is from, or Hong Kong, where he lived for 12 years and believes he can get work.

""I had hoped our wonderful Congress would have figured it out by now,"" said Montgomery, 63. ""We would be paying rent. We would be putting that money back into the economy. It's not as if we are just going to hoard it. We need to spend it.""

Montgomery is among the 7.3 million independent contractors, gig workers, freelancers and self-employed folks who would lose unemployment benefits, according to a recent estimate by The Century Foundation. The program is also available to certain people affected by the coronavirus , including those who are ill or quarantined or have families members who are and those whose children's schools have closed.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — As they frantically searched for ways to salvage President Donald Trump’s failed reelection bid, his campaign pursued a dizzying game of legal hopscotch across six states that centered on the biggest prize of all: Pennsylvania.

The strategy may have played well in front of television cameras and on talk radio to Trump’s supporters. But it has proved a disaster in court , where judges uniformly rejected their claims of vote fraud and found the campaign’s legal work amateurish.

In a scathing ruling late Saturday, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann — a Republican and Federalist Society member in central Pennsylvania — compared the campaign’s legal arguments to “Frankenstein’s Monster,” concluding that Trump’s team offered only “speculative accusations,” not proof of rampant corruption.

The campaign on Sunday filed notice it would appeal the decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a day before the state’s 67 counties are set to certify their results and send them to state officials. And they asked Sunday night for an expedited hearing Wednesday as they seek to amend the Pennsylvania lawsuit that Brann dismissed.

Trump’s efforts in Pennsylvania show how far he is willing to push baseless theories of widespread voter fraud, even as the legal doors close on his attempts to have courts do what voters would not do on Election Day and deliver him a second term.

The effort is being led by Rudy Giuliani , Trump’s personal lawyer, who descended on the state the Saturday after the Nov. 3 election as the count dragged on and the president played golf. Summoning reporters to a scruffy, far-flung corner of Philadelphia on Nov. 7, he held forth at a site that would soon become legendary: Four Seasons Total Landscaping.

The 11:30 a.m. news conference was doomed from the start.

Only minutes earlier, news outlets had started calling the presidential contest for Democrat Joe Biden. The race was over.

Just heating up was Trump’s plan to subvert the election through litigation and howls of fraud — the same tactic he had used to stave off losses in the business world. And it would soon spread far beyond Pennsylvania.

“Some of the ballots looked suspicious,” Giuliani, 76, said of the vote count in Philadelphia as he stood behind a chain link fence, next to a sex shop. He maligned the city as being run by a “decrepit Democratic machine.”

“Those mail-in ballots could have been written the day before, by the Democratic Party hacks that were all over the convention center,” Giuliani said. He promised to file a new round of lawsuits. He rambled.

“This is a very, very strong case,” he asserted.

Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor who specializes in election law, called the Trump lawsuits dangerous.

Full Coverage: Election 2020

“It is a sideshow, but it’s a harmful sideshow,” Levitt said. “It’s a toxic sideshow. The continuing baseless, evidence-free claims of alternative facts are actually having an effect on a substantial number of Americans. They are creating the conditions for elections not to work in the future.”

Not a single court has found merit in the core legal claims, but that did not stop Trump’s team from firing off nearly two dozen legal challenges to Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania, including an early morning suit on Election Day filed by a once-imprisoned lawyer.

The president’s lawyers fought the three-day grace period for mail-in ballots to arrive. They complained they weren’t being let in to observe the vote count. They said Democratic counties unfairly let voters fix mistakes on their ballot envelopes. Everywhere they turned, they said, they sniffed fraud.

“I felt insidious fraud going on,” Philadelphia poll watcher Lisette Tarragano said when Giuliani called her to the microphone at the landscaping company.

In fact, a Republican runs the city’s election board, and has said his office got death threats as Trump’s rants about the election intensified. No judges ever found any evidence of election fraud in Pennsylvania or any other state where the campaign sued — not in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada or Georgia.

Instead, Trump lawyers found themselves backpedaling when pressed in court for admissible evidence, or dropping out when they were accused of helping derail the democratic process.

“I am asking you as a member of the bar of this court, are people representing the Donald J. Trump for president (campaign) … in that room?” U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond asked at an after-hours hearing on Nov. 5, when Republicans asked him to stop the vote count in Philadelphia over their alleged banishment.

“There’s a nonzero number of people in the room,” lawyer Jerome Marcus replied.

The count continued in Philadelphia. The Trump losses kept coming. By Friday, Nov. 6, when a state appeals court rejected a Republican complaint over provisional ballots and a Philadelphia judge refused to throw out 8,300 mail-in ballots they challenged, Biden was up by about 27,000 votes.

Nationally, the race had not yet been called. But it was becoming clear that a Biden win in Pennsylvania, with its 20 electoral votes, was imminent.

When it came, Trump quickly pivoted to litigation. It did not go well.

A U.S. appeals court found Pennsylvania’s three-day extension for mail-in ballots laudatory, given the disruption and mail delays cause by the pandemic. Judges in Michigan and Arizona, finding no evidence of fraud, refused to block the certification of county vote tallies. Law firms representing the campaign started to come under fire and withdrew.

That left Giuliani, who had not argued a case in court for three decades, in charge of the effort to overturn the election.

“You can say a lot at a driveway (news conference). ... When you go to court, you can’t,” said lawyer Mark Aronchick, who represented election officials in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and elsewhere in several of the Pennsylvania suits. “I don’t really pay attention to the chatter until I see a legal brief.”

___

On Tuesday, Giuliani stepped into the courtroom. He was a late addition to the docket after election lawyers from Porter Wright Morris & Arthur had bowed out over the previous weekend. He had an entourage in tow, a show of force that had everything but a compelling legal argument.

Giuliani asked Brann to hold up the certification of the state’s 6.8 million ballots over two Republican voters whose mail-in ballots were tossed over technical errors.

“I sat dumbfounded listening,” said Aronchick, a seasoned trial lawyer.

“We were ready to argue the one count. Instead, he treated us to an even more expanded version of his Total Landscaping press conference,” Aronchick said. “It didn’t bear any relationship to the actual case.”

Giuliani, admired by some for his tough talk as Manhattan’s top prosecutor and his leadership as New York City’s mayor during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, struggled to answer even basic legal questions.

But he waxed on about a supposed conspiracy to rig the state election.

“The best description of this situation is widespread, nationwide voter fraud,” Giuliani argued. Under questioning, though, he acknowledged their complaint no longer included a fraud claim.

And then, just as it had at Four Seasons, reality came crashing down on him, when news broke in the courtroom that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had rejected the campaign’s appeal over observer access in Philadelphia. It was one of the campaign’s last remaining claims.

Even the dissent was crushing.

“The notion that presumptively valid ballots cast by the Pennsylvania electorate would be disregarded based on isolated procedural irregularities that have been redressed ... is misguided,” Chief Justice Thomas G. Saylor wrote for the minority in the 5-2 decision.

Brann, who sits in Williamsport, let the federal court hearing drag on past the dinner hour, and gave both sides time to file additional motions. The campaign filings were replete with typos, spelling mistakes and even an errant reference to a “Second Amendment Complaint” instead of a second amended complaint.

The campaign took the opportunity to answer one of the more puzzling questions that its election challenge raised: It only wanted the presidential election results set aside, not votes on the same ballots for other offices. The briefs were filed by Giuliani and co-counsel Marc Scaringi, a local conservative talk radio host who, before he was hired, had questioned the point of the Trump litigation, saying “it will not reverse this election.”

Aronchick balked at the campaign’s core premise that local election workers — perhaps working for the Mafia, as Giuliani suggested — had plotted to spoil Trump’s win.

“You’re going to suggest part of them are in a conspiracy? How does that work?” Aronchick asked. “Who? Where? When? How?”

Brann, in his ruling, said he expected the campaign to present formidable evidence of rampant corruption as it sought to nullify millions of votes. Instead, he said, the campaign presented “strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations.”

The 3rd Circuit, based in Philadelphia, may have already tipped its hand. In its Nov. 13 ruling, the appeals court called it “indisputable in our democratic process: that the lawfully cast vote of every citizen must count.”

Biden’s lead in the state has expanded to more than 80,000 votes.

“Our system depends on the possibility that you might lose a fair contest. If that possibility doesn’t exist, you don’t have a democracy,” said Levitt, the law school professor. “There are countries that run like that. It just doesn’t describe America.”

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A federal judge issued a scathing order Saturday dismissing the Trump campaign’s futile effort to block the certification of votes in Pennsylvania, shooting down claims of widespread irregularities with mail-in ballots.

The case was always a long shot to stop President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, but it was President Donald Trump’s best hope to affect the election results through the courts, mostly because of the number of electoral votes, 20, at stake in Pennsylvania. His personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, stepped into a courtroom for the first time in decades to argue the case this past week.

U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Brann wrote in his order that Trump had asked the court to disenfranchise almost 7 million voters.

“One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption,” Brann wrote, so much that the court would have no option but to stop the certification even though it would impact so many people. “That has not happened.”

Full Coverage: Election 2020

Even if he’d won the Pennsylvania case, Trump would have needed to win other lawsuits in other states where he’d also asked to delay certification. The campaign peppered battlegrounds states with litigation in the days after the election alleging widespread election fraud without proof, but the majority of those cases have already been dismissed.

The president has taken his effort to subvert the results of the 2020 election beyond the courtroom in recent days, straight to local lawmakers. Some Trump allies have expressed hope that state lawmakers could intervene in selecting Republican electors.

With that in mind Trump invited Michigan legislators to the White House on Friday, hoping that an Oval Office meeting would persuade them to set aside the popular vote favoring Biden by more than 154,000. But the lawmakers issued a statement after the meeting that they would follow the law and “normal process” on electors. Trump was said to be considering extending a similar invitation to lawmakers from Pennsylvania.

Time is running out for Trump and his campaign, as states certify their results one after another showing that Biden won the requisite 270 Electoral College votes to take office.

Brann ruled that Pennsylvania officials can certify election results that currently show Biden winning the state by more than 80,000 votes. He said the Trump campaign presented “strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations ... unsupported by evidence.”

“In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state,” the opinion said. “Our people, laws, and institutions demand more.”

Trump tweeted after the ruling that he couldn’t understand why Biden was forming a Cabinet when the president’s investigators had found “hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes,” a baseless claim for which Trump has supplied no evidence.

Giuliani and a Trump campaign lawyer said in a statement that they welcomed the dismissal because it would allow them to appeal up to the U.S. Supreme Court faster, where Trump has repeatedly said he feels he has sympathetic justices. But, the justices heard a case from the state before the election, over a three-day extension on mail-in ballots, and allowed the extension over the objections of the GOP.

Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who had a hand in placing Brann on the bench during the Obama administration, said the ruling showed Trump had exhausted all possible legal avenues in the state and went on to congratulate Biden on his victory. He called Brann “a longtime conservative Republican whom I know to be a fair and unbiased jurist.”

Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York mayor, showed his rustiness during the hearing this week by tripping himself up over the meaning of “opacity,” mistaking the judge for a federal judge in a separate district and provoking an opposing lawyer.

Giuliani repeatedly contended in court that it was illegal for counties to help people vote. Opposing lawyer Mark Aronchick suggested Giuliani must not know the Pennsylvania election code.

The Trump-aligned attorneys had argued that the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law was violated when Pennsylvania counties took different approaches to notifying voters before the election about technical problems with their submitted mail-in ballots.

The judge dismissed the argument entirely.

Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and the seven Biden-majority counties that the campaign sued had argued throwing out the popular vote over isolated allegations of mail-in fraud was far too extreme, particularly after most of them have been tallied.

“There is no justification on any level for the radical disenfranchisement they seek,” Boockvar’s lawyers wrote in a brief filed Thursday.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, tweeted shortly after Brann’s ruling that “another one bites the dust.”

“These claims were meritless from the start and for an audience of one,” Shapiro said in a statement. “The will of the people will prevail. These baseless lawsuits need to end.”

Counties must certify their results to Boockvar by Monday, after which she will make her own certification. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf will notify the winning candidate’s electors they should appear to vote in the Capitol on Dec. 14.

Gov. Kemp calls for signature audit of Georgia vote,0,jyc5j0,https://wdef.com/2020/11/20/gov-kemp-calls-signature-audit-georgia-vote/,3,1605999815.0,,"ATLANTA (WDEF) – Gov. Brian Kemp will certify the election results because he is required to by law.

But in a Friday evening news conference, he said he is not happy about it.

- Advertisement -

“It’s quite honestly hard to believe that during the audit, that thousands of uncounted ballots were found in a razor-thin outcome in a presidential election. This is simply unacceptable.”

He notes that the recount only looked at the actual ballots, not the signatures on the envelopes.

The Governor is calling for the Secretary of State to review the signatures to make sure they match.

Critics say that could weed out fraudulent or fake votes that were cast.

But despite the criticism, Secretary of State Raffensberger has defended the signature verification process on the ballots.

Raffensberger has submitted a final vote count for the Governor to certify which shows Joe Biden winning the state by more than 12,000 votes.

The Republican says he believes the numbers are correct.

Gov. Kemp this evening also called on future legislation to tighten up photo ID requirements on mail in ballots.

He adds that certifying the vote will clear the way for the President’s team to take further legal action. All of his lawsuits so far over the Georgia vote have been tossed out by judges.

President Trump has attacked Governor Kemp for not cracking down on the Republican Secretary of State. This was his tweet this afternoon.

Kemp, himself, was the Secretary of State just two years ago.

He was questioned at the time for overseeing his own election for Governor, in which he narrowly defeated Stacey Abrams."
Thousands protest against French bill to curb identification of police,280,jyizej,https://in.reuters.com/article/france-security-police-video-idINKBN2810TA,9,1606023002.0,,"PARIS (Reuters) - Several thousand people protested in Paris on Saturday against a bill that would make it a crime to circulate an image of a police officer’s face with the intention that they should be harmed.

Supporters say police officers and their families need protection from harassment, both online and in person when off duty.

Opponents say the law would infringe journalists’ freedom to report, and make it harder to hold police accountable for abuses such as excessive use of force - a growing public concern. The offence would carry a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a 45,000-euro ($53,000) fine.

On the Trocadero Square in western Paris, rights activists, trade unionists and journalists chanted “Everybody wants to film the police!” and “Freedom!”, as police wearing riot gear stood by around the square.

Many demonstrators wore the high-visibility jackets of the “Yellow Vest” movement that started a wave of anti-government protests two years ago.

Some held signs that read “We’ll put down our (smart)phones when you put down your weapons”.

Similar demonstrations were planned in Marseille, Lille, Montpellier, Rennes, Saint-Etienne and Nice.

In Paris, police clashed with demonstrators at the end of the protest. By 7:45 p.m., 23 people had been arrested and a police officer slightly injured, the police prefecture tweeted.

Edwy Plenel, chief editor of the investigative news website Mediapart, said the proposed legislation was “a green light for the worst elements in the police”.

“Those in power are increasingly trying to prevent citizens, journalists and whistleblowers from revealing the failures of the state. When this happens, democracy fades away,” he added.

Last Tuesday, two journalists were detained in a protest that led to clashes with police as lawmakers in the National Assembly began debating the bill, which is backed by President Emmanuel Macron’s party and its parliamentary allies.

The bill passed its first reading on Friday and there will be a second reading on Tuesday. It then goes to the Senate for further debate before it can become law.

An amendment drafted by the government and approved on Friday modified the article in question, 24, to add the phrase “without prejudice to the right to inform”.

Prime Minister Jean Castex said this would “remove any ambiguity on the intention to guarantee respect for public freedoms while better protecting those, police and gendarmes, who ensure the protection of the population”."
Panic buying of toilet paper hits U.S. stores again with new pandemic restrictions,287,jy9p2g,https://reut.rs/3nM7uFY,34,1605989226.0,,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Toilet paper aisles are emptying again as COVID-19 curfews and shutdowns in states from California to New York send pandemic-weary shoppers on a new scramble for essentials.

Walmart on Friday said it was “seeing pockets of lower than normal availability” for toilet paper and cleaning supplies in some communities as infections rage virtually unchecked across most of the United States.

As of Friday afternoon, 22 states have imposed restrictions aimed at decreasing spread of the virus - giving rise to a new round of panic buying from shoppers and purchase limits from retailers including Target and Kroger, the nation’s largest supermarket chain.

Shoppers in a half dozen cities around the United States told Reuters that disinfecting wipes were sold out at discount retailers like Walmart and Costco, as well as at Cerberus Capital-owned grocery chains Albertsons and Vons.

“Walmarts are still mostly out of Lysol wipes, and toilet paper is out again,” said Whitley Hatcher, 31, a collections specialist in Tucson, Arizona.

“Oddly though, at places like Walgreens and Dollar Tree you can find what you need. I think people are seeing the empty shelves at bigger stores and panic buying,” Hatcher said.

At a Costco in Vancouver, Washington - where new rules include temporary bans on indoor dining - out-of-stocks included toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning wipes, gloves and Spam canned meat.

And the toilet paper hunt is on again in California, where the governor on Thursday ordered a curfew placed on all indoor social gatherings and non-essential activities outside the home across most of the state.

Shoppers said toilet paper was sold out at Costco stores in Fresno and Los Angeles.

In San Diego, internet marketer Melin Isa took note of renewed shortages during a recent ice cream run to her local Vons. “The TP aisle is bare. Big jugs of milk mostly gone. Lots of ice cream,” Isa said.

Charmin maker Procter & Gamble, the No. 1 U.S. toilet paper seller, said it is running plants 24/7 to meet demand.

Over the last several months, retailers have had to make major, costly changes to their supply chains to meet unexpected surges in demand.

In a response to a tweet complaining about sold out toilet paper and paper towels, Walmart’s Sam’s Club said, “We’re working to replenish these items as fast as humanly possible.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is doing “very well” in quarantine after becoming infected with the coronavirus.

“My son Donald is doing very well. Thank you!” the president tweeted, following Friday’s disclosure that the 42-year-old Trump scion had become one of the nearly 12 million Americans infected by the virus.

More than 250,000 Americans have lost their lives to the virus, the highest death toll of any country.

Donald Trump Jr. learned of his positive test result earlier this week, has had no symptoms and was following all medically recommended guidelines for treating the illness, said a spokesperson, who was granted anonymity to discuss private medical information.

President-elect Joe Biden made President Trump’s response to the virus a top issue in the recently concluded race for the White House, though Trump has yet to acknowledge the outcome.

President Trump, first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron have all recovered from their coronavirus infections in October. The president spent three days in a military hospital, where he was treated with experimental drugs; the first lady weathered her illness at the White House.

Donald Trump Jr.’s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, tested positive for the coronavirus in July.

Scores of people who work for or associate with the president have also recovered from recent infections, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Michigan GOP leaders after White House meeting: 'We will follow the law',280,jy12va,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/20/biden-adviser-michigan-lawmakers-cant-intervene-election-result/6355274002/,29,1605947538.0,,"Washington — Michigan’s top two legislative leaders vowed Friday that the presidential candidate with the most votes will win the state's electoral votes after departing a meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House.

With the eyes of the nation on them and criticisms flying from Democrats, seven Michigan lawmakers traveled to meet with Trump for about an hour. The visit came as supporters of the president have moved in recent days to overturn the results of the state's election, which Democratic President-elect Joe Biden won by more than 154,000 votes in unofficial returns.

""We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and, as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors, just as we have said throughout this election,"" House Speaker Lee Chatfield and Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey said in a joint statement after the meeting.

Chatfield, R-Levering, and Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said they highlighted during the meeting their desire to see ""further federal dollars"" appropriated for Michigan as the state deals with the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the statement, they also said fraudulent behavior in the election should be taken seriously and the candidates ""who win the most votes win elections and Michigan's electoral votes.""

""These are simple truths that should provide confidence in our elections,"" they added.

House Minority Leader Chris Greig, D-Farmington Hills, said she was glad to hear the Republicans confirm ""they won't interfere with the process or the will of the voters.""

""(I) would have liked for them to have implored the president to concede and move forward with our time-honored transition of power,"" said Greig, the top Democrat in the state House. ""It's time to move forward and heal this country.""

Democratic protesters, who trailed the lawmakers for part of the day Friday, projected a message for them on the facade of the Trump Hotel, where they were thought to be staying. It showed Mike Shirkey and Lee Chatfield’s names and photos and said “the world is watching” and “voters decided.” (Photo: Andre Chug, Associated Press)

Seven Michigan GOP lawmakers arrived at the White House just before 4 p.m. Friday. They were inside for about an hour and 45 minutes. They left after 5:30 p.m. laughing and in good spirits.

But Bob Bauer, a legal adviser for Biden's campaign, blasted the meeting between the president and the Republican leaders of the Michigan House and Senate as the state prepares to certify its election results as early as Monday.

""It's an abuse of office,"" Bauer told reporters earlier Friday. ""It's an open attempt to intimidate election officials. It's absolutely appalling.""

Bauer said Friday morning that it's ""not possible"" for the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature to redirect the state's electoral votes to Trump.

Chatfield and Shirkey were joined at the White House by Reps. Jason Wentworth, R-Farwell, and Jim Lilly, R-Park Township; as well as Sens. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte; Dan Lauwers, R-Brockway Township; and Aric Nesbitt, R-Lawton. Wentworth will be the speaker of the House in 2021 when Chatfield departs because of term limits.

Despite criticism from Democrats, Chatfield welcomed the opportunity to meet with Trump.

""No matter the party, when you have an opportunity to meet with the President of the United States, of course you take it,"" the House speaker tweeted Friday. ""I won’t apologize for that. In fact, I’m honored to speak with POTUS and proud to meet with him. And I look forward to our conversation.""

Chatfield and Shirkey added afterward that they used their time to deliver a letter to Trump ""making clear our support for additional federal funds to help Michigan in the fight against COVID-19."" Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer similarly has been advocating for more federal COVID-19 aid as she supports the Democratic-led U.S. House's $2.2 trillion package.

The governor spent time Friday listening to health experts and front-line workers while Chatfield and Shirkey entertained the president's ""delusional election conspiracies,"" Whitmer spokesman Zack Pohl said.

""If you actually believe these guys talked about COVID relief — when they refused to sign a similar letter with the governor earlier this week — I've got a bridge to sell you,"" Pohl tweeted.

White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern told reporters the event was an opportunity for the president to meet with legislators.

""I believe these are Republican legislators who are fans of the president, admire the president. They’ve spoken to this,"" Morgenstern said. ""I think they issued some statements that they are excited to meet him and share ideas and thoughts. I don’t have any more specifics about that at this time.""

Trump's campaign is claiming that there are enough ""illegitimate ballots"" in the state to swing the results, but the campaign hasn't provided evidence that would suggest the type of widespread fraud it's alleging. And a Wayne County judge has labeled the campaign's claims ""not credible.""

The Board of State Canvassers, which features two Republicans and two Democrats, is scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the certified county results and possibly vote on certifying the statewide election results, a key procedural step.

Federal law gives the states until Dec. 8, known as the ""safe harbor"" day, to certify their election results.

Asked if the president would ask the Michigan Republican leaders to appoint pro-Trump electors, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Friday it is “not an advocacy meeting.”

“There will be no one from the campaign there. He routinely meets with lawmakers from all across the country,” McEnany said at a briefing.

Asked at what point Trump will concede, she pointed to ongoing litigation and that there are “very real claims out there,” referencing affidavits filed by GOP observers in Wayne County.

“Two individuals on the canvassing board there that have declined to certify” the results, McEnany said. “These are real claims these individuals deserve to be heard on a system that's never been tried in American history — mass mail-out voting.”

The two Republican canvassers voted to certify Wayne County's results after initially declining to do so. They demanded an audit of out-of-balance absentee counting boards as a condition of their certification vote.

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has said she will conduct an audit of certain Wayne County votes after the statewide certification of votes, which is required by law.

The president will not be successful in attempts to change the election's results, Bauer said Friday. Bauer served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama. The former vice president won Michigan 51%-48% or by 154,000 votes on Nov. 3, according to results that have been certified by all 83 counties.

""The popular vote governs,"" he said of Michigan. ""That was the system in place on Nov. 3 and that is the system that is going to produce the slate of Biden-Harris electors.""

Trying to change the fact is ""not possible"" and ""not legal,"" Bauer said. It ""cannot happen,"" he added. Likewise, Bauer said any attempt to delay the certification of Michigan's votes would ultimately not be successful.

""State law provides deadlines for votes to be certified and those deadlines are enforceable,"" he said.

The deadlines fall before Dec. 14, when the Electoral College meets.

“The attempt to delay may be undertaken but it won't be successful,"" Bauer said.

Norm Shinkle, a Republican member of the Board of State Canvassers, has said he anticipates making a motion next week for some kind of audit of the Nov. 3 election.

“We’ve got to dig deeper on the core issues here,” Shinkle said. “We have to have an audit. The question is: How do you define that?

“I’m very much inclined to find out what happened for the sake of future elections in Michigan.""

Democratic protesters, who trailed the lawmakers for part of the day Friday, projected a message for them on the facade of the Trump Hotel, where they were thought to be staying.

U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, who was the first House Republican to congratulate Biden on winning the election, criticized the effort to overturn Michigan’s vote.

“I've not seeing any evidence of fraud that would overturn 150,000 votes,” Upton told reporters Friday outside the U.S. Capitol.

Upton said he hadn’t spoken to any of the Michigan legislative leaders coming to Washington to meet with Trump at the White House.

The St. Joseph Republican also noted that the Michigan Legislature doesn’t have the votes to override Whitmer if it were to try to change the rules regarding the appointment of electors.

“As far as I know, the governor would have to sign that too. They don't have the votes to override her. That's just a dead-end,” Upton said.

He also cast doubt on the possibility the dispute over the election would end up in the U.S. House for lawmakers to decide.

“I think that's pretty much a long shot. I don't expect that to happen. I'm not a lawyer but I don't see judges overturning a certified election. Georgia is doing theirs today and they actually went back and hand counted,” Upton said. “Again, no one has shown any evidence that would overturn the margin.”

In a separate Friday Michigan Democratic Party press conference, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell of Dearborn said Shirkey and Chatfield's meeting with the president is ""totally inappropriate"" and a move that ""deeply, deeply concerns"" her.

""When the president of the United States calls, most times, no matter who you are, you respond. But you don't respond when he's about to use you as a prop. Or worse yet, try to bribe you,"" Dingell said. ""By accepting this meeting, the speaker and the majority leader are helping him undermine the will of the voters.""

After Chatfield and Shirkey issued their joint statement, the Democratic congresswoman called on the Board of State Canvassers to certify the election results.

""Discussing the need for COVID relief is critical, but we must move forward with certifying the vote on Monday as the law requires,"" Dingell tweeted later Friday. ""We all need to work together to protect our democracy and not attack its fundamental pillars.""

Democratic protesters, who trailed the Michigan lawmakers for part of the day, projected messages for them on the facade of the Trump Hotel, where they were thought to be staying. It showed Shirkey's and Chatfield’s names and photos and said “the world is watching” and “voters decided.”

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) — A 17-year-old from Illinois who is charged with killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin and whose case has become a rallying cry for some conservatives posted $2 million bail Friday and was released from custody.

Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz during a demonstration Aug. 25 that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. He posted bond through his attorney at about 2 p.m., Kenosha County Sheriff’s Sgt. David Wright said.

Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, told police he was attacked while he was guarding a business and that he fired in self-defense.

He faces multiple charges, including intentional homicide, reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Wisconsin law doesn’t permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless they’re hunting. He is due back in court on Dec. 3 for a preliminary hearing.

His case has taken on political overtones. Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have painted Rittenhouse as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives upset over property destruction during recent protests have portrayed him as a patriot exercising his right to bear arms during unrest. A legal defense fund for him has attracted millions of dollars in donations , and his mother got a standing ovation from women at a Waukesha County GOP function in September.

Huber’s father, John Huber, asked Kenosha County Circuit Court Commissioner Loren Keating during a hearing Nov. 2 to set Rittenhouse’s bail between $4 million and $10 million. Huber said Rittenhouse thinks he’s above the law and noted the effort to raise money on his behalf. He also suggested militia groups would hide him from police if he were released.

Rittenhouse’s attorney, Mark Richards, asked for $750,000 bail.

Keating ultimately set bail at $2 million, saying Rittenhouse was a flight risk given the seriousness of the charges against him."
Why Republican voters say there’s ‘no way in hell’ Trump lost,184,jxt084,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-fraud-insight/why-republican-voters-say-theres-no-way-in-hell-trump-lost-idUSKBN2801D4,63,1605921017.0,,"SUNDOWN, Texas (Reuters) - Brett Fryar is a middle-class Republican. A 50-year-old chiropractor in this west Texas town, he owns a small business. He has two undergraduate degrees and a master’s degree, in organic chemistry. He attends Southcrest Baptist Church in nearby Lubbock.

Fryar didn’t much like Donald Trump at first, during the U.S. president’s 2016 campaign. He voted for Texas Senator Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries.

Now, Fryar says he would go to war for Trump. He has joined the newly formed South Plains Patriots, a group of a few hundred members that includes a “reactionary” force of about three dozen - including Fryar and his son, Caleb - who conduct firearms training.

Nothing will convince Fryar and many others here in Sundown - including the town’s mayor, another Patriots member - that Democrat Joe Biden won the Nov. 3 presidential election fairly. They believe Trump’s stream of election-fraud allegations and say they’re preparing for the possibility of a “civil war” with the American political left.

“If President Trump comes out and says: ‘Guys, I have irrefutable proof of fraud, the courts won’t listen, and I’m now calling on Americans to take up arms,’ we would go,” said Fryar, wearing a button-down shirt, pressed slacks and a paisley tie during a recent interview at his office.

The unshakable trust in Trump in this town of about 1,400 residents reflects a national phenomenon among many Republicans, despite the absence of evidence in a barrage of post-election lawsuits by the president and his allies. About half of Republicans polled by Reuters/Ipsos said Trump “rightfully won” the election but had it stolen from him in systemic fraud favoring Biden, according to a survey conducted between Nov. 13 and 17. Just 29% of Republicans said Biden rightfully won. Other polls since the election have reported that an even higher proportion - up to 80% - of Republicans trust Trump’s baseless fraud narrative.

Trump’s legal onslaught has so far flopped, with judges quickly dismissing many cases and his lawyers dropping or withdrawing from others. None of the cases contain allegations - much less evidence - that are likely to invalidate enough votes to overturn the election, election experts say.

And yet the election-theft claims are proving politically potent. All but a handful of Republican lawmakers have backed Trump’s fraud claims or stayed silent, effectively freezing the transition of power as the president refuses to concede. Trump has succeeded in sowing further public distrust in the media, which typically calls elections, and undermined citizens’ faith in the state and local election officials who underpin American democracy.

In Reuters interviews with 50 Trump voters, all said they believed the election was rigged or in some way illegitimate. Of those, 20 said they would consider accepting Biden as their president, but only in light of proof that the election was conducted fairly. Most repeated debunked conspiracy theories espoused by Trump, Republican officials and conservative media claiming that millions of votes were dishonestly switched to Biden in key states by biased poll workers and hacked voting machines.

Many voters interviewed by Reuters said they formed their opinions by watching emergent right-wing media outlets such as Newsmax and One American News Network that have amplified Trump’s fraud claims. Some have boycotted Fox News out of anger that the network called Biden the election winner and that some of its news anchors - in contrast to its opinion show stars - have been skeptical of Trump’s fraud allegations.

“I just sent Fox News an email,” Fryar said, telling the network: “You’re the only news I’ve watched for the last six years, but I will not watch you anymore.”

The widespread rejection of the election result among Republicans reflects a new and dangerous dynamic in American politics: the normalization of false and increasingly extreme conspiracy theories among tens of millions of mainstream voters, according to government scholars, analysts and some lawmakers on both sides of the political divide. The trend has deeply troubling long-term implications for American political and civic institutions, said Paul Light, a veteran political scientist at New York University (NYU).

“This is dystopian,” Light said. “America could fracture.”

Adam Kinzinger, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, is among the few party members to publicly recognize Biden’s victory. He called his Republican colleagues’ reluctance to reject Trump’s conspiracies a failure of political courage that threatens to undermine American democracy for years. If citizens lose faith in election integrity, that could lead to “really bad things,” including violence and social unrest, he said in an interview.

David Gergen - an adviser to four previous U.S. presidents, two Democrats and two Republicans - said Trump is trying to “kneecap” the Biden administration before it takes power, noting this is the first time a sitting American president has tried to overthrow an election result.

It may not be the last time. Many Republicans see attacks on election integrity as a winning issue for future campaigns - including the next presidential race, according to one Republican operative close to the Trump campaign. The party, the person said, is setting up a push for “far more stringent oversight on voting procedures in 2024,” when the party’s nominee will likely be Trump or his anointed successor.

Other Republicans urged patience and faith in the government. Charlie Black, a veteran Republican strategist, does not believe Republican lawmakers will continue backing Trump’s fraud claims after Biden is inaugurated. They will need White House cooperation on basic government functions, such as appropriations and defense bills, he said.

“People will come to see we still have a functioning government,” Black said, and Republicans will become “resigned to Biden, and see it’s not the end of the world.”

The Biden campaign declined to comment for this story. Boris Epshteyn, a strategic advisor to the Trump campaign, said: “The President and his campaign are confident that when every legal vote is counted, and every illegal vote is not, it will be determined that President Trump has won re-election to a second term.”

‘THERE’S JUST NO WAY’

Media outlets declared Biden the election winner on Nov. 7. As calls were finalized in battleground states, Biden’s lead in the Electoral College that decides the presidency widened to 306 to 232. (For a graphic explaining the electoral college, see: tmsnrt.rs/38VTUvK )

Many Republican voters scoff at those results, convinced Trump was cheated. Raymond Fontaine, a hardware store owner in Oakville, Connecticut, said Biden’s vote total - the highest of any presidential candidate in history - makes no sense because the 78-year-old Democrat made relatively few campaign appearances and seemed to be in mental decline.

“You are going to tell me 77 million Americans voted for him? There is just no way,” said Fontaine, 50.

The latest popular vote total for Biden has grown to about 79 million, compared to some 73 million for Trump.

Like many Trump supporters interviewed by Reuters, Fontaine was deeply suspicious of computerized voting machines. Trump and his allies have alleged, without producing evidence, a grand conspiracy to manipulate votes through the software used in many battleground states.

In Grant County, West Virginia - a mountainous region where more than 88% of voters backed the president - trust in Trump runs deep. Janet Hedrick, co-owner of the Smoke Hole Caverns log cabin resort in the small town of Cabins, said she would never accept Biden as a legitimate president.

“There’s millions and millions of Trump votes that were just thrown out,” said Hedrick, 70, a retired teacher and librarian. “That computer was throwing them out.”

At the Sunset Restaurant in Moorefield, West Virginia - a diner featuring omelettes, hotcakes and waitresses who remember your order - a mention of the election sparked a spirited discussion at one table. Gene See, a retired highway construction inspector, and Bob Hyson, a semi-retired insurance sales manager, said Trump had been cheated, that Biden had dementia and that Democrats planned all along to quickly replace Biden with his more liberal running mate for vice president, Kamala Harris.

“I think if they ever get to the bottom of it, they will find massive fraud,” said another of the diners, Larry Kessel, a 67-year-old farmer.

Kessel’s wife, Jane, patted him on the arm, trying to calm him, as he grew agitated while railing against anti-Trump media bias.

Trump’s rage against the media has lately included rants against Fox News. He has pushed his supporters towards more right-wing outlets such as Newsmax and One America News Network, which have championed the president’s fraud claims.

Rory Wells, 51, a New Jersey lawyer who attended a pro-Trump “stop the steal” election protest in Trenton last week, said he now watches Newsmax because Fox isn’t sufficiently conservative.

“I like that I get to hear from Rudy Giuliani and others who are not immediately discounted as being crazy,” he said of Trump’s lead election lawyer.

Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy said the network’s viewership has exploded since the election, with nearly 3 million viewers nightly via cable television and streaming video devices.

Ruddy said Newsmax isn’t saying that Biden stole the election - but they’re also not calling him the winner given that Trump has valid legal claims. “The same media who said Biden would win in a landslide now want to not have recounts,” he said in a phone interview.

Charles Herring, president of One America News Network, said in a statement that his network has seen three weeks of record ratings, as “frustrated Fox News viewers” have tuned in.

‘NO WAY IN HELL’

Some Trump supporters said they would accept Biden as the winner if that is the final, official result. Janel Henritz, 36, echoed some others in saying that she believed the election included fraud, but perhaps not enough to change the outcome. Henritz, who works alongside her mother Janet Hedrick at their log cabin resort in West Virginia, said she would accept the outcome if Biden remains the winner after recounts and court challenges.

“Then he won fair and square,” she said.

In Sundown, Texas, Mayor Jonathan Strickland said there’s “no way in hell” Biden won fairly. The only way he’ll believe it, he said, is if Trump himself says so.

“Trump is the only one we’ve been able to trust for the last four years,” said Strickland, an oilfield production engineer. “As far as the civil war goes, I don’t think it’s off the table.”

If it comes to a fight, Caleb Fryar is ready. But the 26-year-old son of Brett Fryar, the chiropractor, said he hoped Trump’s fraud allegations would instead spark a massive mobilization of Republican voters in future elections.

Asked whether Trump might be duping his followers, he said it’s hard to fathom.

“If I’m being manipulated by Trump ... then he is the greatest con man that ever lived in America,” Caleb Fryar said. “I think he’s the greatest patriot that ever lived.”

Trump Fraud Investigations Now Include Tax Write-offs for Ivanka,30,jxm2ey,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/trump-fraud-inquiries-include-write-offs-to-ivanka-report.html,3,1605893243.0,,"Who needs a silver spoon when you have a gold shovel? Photo: Getty Images

Since September, New York prosecutors have opened two inquiries that could require Donald Trump to fend off potential charges of fraud in the early days of his life after the presidency. A report from the New York Times on Thursday provides new details on the criminal investigation led by Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and the civil investigation led by New York attorney general Letitia James. Both prosecutors are reportedly looking at apparent tax write-off schemes at the Trump Organization, some of which include the president’s eldest daughter.

The Times reports that the authorities, who are acting independently, have subpoenaed the Trump Organization in recent weeks for records pertaining to tax deductions taken on consulting fees. And though there is little public knowledge about the current focus of the investigations, a Times exposé on Trump’s tax returns reveals the kind of incongruities that would catch the eyes of prosecutors:

Among the revelations was that Mr. Trump reduced his taxable income by deducting about $26 million in fees to unidentified consultants as a business expense on numerous projects between 2010 and 2018.

Some of those fees appear to have been paid to Ms. Trump, The Times found. On a 2017 disclosure she filed when joining the White House as a presidential adviser, she reported receiving payments from a consulting company she co-owned, totaling $747,622, that exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects in Hawaii and Vancouver, British Columbia.

Ms. Trump was an executive officer of the Trump companies that made the payments, meaning she appears to have been treated as a consultant while also working for the company. While companies can deduct professional fees, the Internal Revenue Service requires that consulting arrangements be market-based and reasonable, as well as “ordinary and necessary” to running a business.

The good news for Ivanka is that there is “no indication” that she is a “focus of either inquiry,” according to the Times. (Nevertheless, she wasn’t thrilled by the development. “This is harassment pure and simple,” she tweeted, adding: “This ‘inquiry’ by NYC Democrats is 100% motivated by politics, publicity, and rage.”) The bad news for the family is that both of these inquiries are at the state level, so if they develop into court cases, they are unaffected by a potential presidential pardon, which only covers federal crimes.

Ivanka Trump has been under scrutiny from state and local authorities before. As part of the agreement that shuttered the self-dealing Donald J. Trump Foundation, Ivanka Trump and her brothers Eric and Donald Jr. were ordered to receive “training on the duties of officers and directors of charities so that they cannot allow the illegal activity they oversaw at the Trump Foundation to take place again,” according to the terms of the settlement. And according to ProPublica, Vance’s office was building a criminal case against Ivanka and Don Jr. in 2012 for inflating the sales of property in the Trump Soho building to mislead prospective buyers. Vance overruled prosecutors, telling them to close the investigation. He later told ProPublica he didn’t see a case — though he acted after a visit from Trump’s then-attorney, who had recently made a $25,000 contribution to Vance’s campaign.

Anomalies found in data put census deadline in jeopardy,28,jxrq33,https://apnews.com/article/census-2020-at-risk-data-anomalies-72faf48e34cc092af4b7c600eb6952f3,3,1605917062.0,,"U.S. Census Director Steven Dillingham departs a census news conference to urge Arizonans to participate in the nation's once-a-decade population count Thursday, Sept. 17, 2020, in Phoenix.

The director of the Census Bureau said Thursday that irregularities have been found during the numbers-crunching phase of the 2020 census, a development that jeopardizes the statistical agency’s ability to meet a year-end deadline for handing in numbers used for divvying up congressional seats.

The Census Bureau already was facing a shortened schedule of two and a half months for processing the data collected during the 2020 census — about half the time originally planned. The Census Bureau would not say Thursday what the anomalies were or publicly state if there would be a new deadline for the apportionment numbers.

“These types of processing anomalies have occurred in past censuses,” Census Bureau director Steven Dillingham said in a statement. “I am directing the Census Bureau to utilize all resources available to resolve this as expeditiously as possible. As it has been all along, our goal remains an accurate and statistically sound Census.”

The Census Bureau said it would not comment further.

“This is not surprising to me at all,” said Robert Santos, president-elect of the American Statistical Association, in an email. “The notion that the 2020 Census data could be processed in half the time scheduled given all the obstacles & challenges that Census Bureau encountered defies logic.”

Those challenges included a pandemic, wildfires out West and hurricanes in Gulf Coast states.

Missing the Dec. 31 deadline for turning in the apportionment numbers would be a blow to President Donald Trump’s efforts to exclude people in the country illegally from being counted in the numbers used to determine how many congressional seats each state gets and how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed.

Full Coverage: Census 2020

Once the president receives the numbers by the Dec. 31 deadline, the president has about a week from the start of the next Congress to transmit them to the House. If the Census Bureau delays turning in the apportionment numbers because of the processing problems, that transfer of the numbers could take place after President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

Trump’s apportionment order has been found unlawful by three courts — in New York, California and Maryland. The Justice Department has appealed to the Supreme Court, which is hearing arguments at the end of the month.

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which oversees the Census Bureau, wasn’t informed about the irregularities before they became public, said U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who chairs the committee.

Maloney demanded information from the bureau about the anomalies, data accuracy and potential delays in the schedule.

Because of the pandemic, the Census Bureau switched its deadline for wrapping up the once-a-decade head count of every U.S. resident from the end of July to the end of October. It also extended the deadline for turning in the apportionment numbers from the end of December to the end of next April, giving bureau statisticians five months to crunch the numbers.

However in late July and early August, officials at the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, announced field operations would finish at the end of September and the apportionment numbers would stick to a congressionally-mandated deadline of Dec. 31.

A coalition of local governments and advocacy groups sued, claiming a shortened schedule would shortchange minorities and hard-to-count communities. Their lawsuit also said the schedule was shortened to make sure the numbers-crunching took place on the Trump administration’s watch so that the president’s order on apportionment could be enforced.

Jeffrey Wice, an adjunct professor at New York Law School who is an expert in census law and redistricting, said he would not be surprised if the president, in his last weeks in office, installs as the bureau’s head a political appointee “who will do whatever Trump wants him to do.”

In the past year, the Trump administration has named a handful of political appointees to the Census Bureau’s leadership team, drawing sharp criticism from Democratic leaders of a House oversight committee and questions about their hiring from the Commerce Department’s inspector general.

“That is totally unpredictable,” said Wice, who has worked with the national Democratic Party on redistricting programs.

Perdue Hit With More Allegations of Shady Stock Transactions,355,jxqu5d,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/perdue-hit-with-more-allegations-of-shady-stock-transactions.html,17,1605914234.0,,"It’s not the best time for David Perdue to face multiple questions about his investments. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images

One sure thing about being a rich politician is that your electoral opponents are going to take a look at whether you are profiting from your elected office. Media watchdogs keep looking at Georgia Senator David Perdue’s investment history, and they keep finding troublesome transactions. The latest involves his buying and selling of stocks in a Navy contractor before and after he took over the Senate subcommittee that oversees the fleet.

Questions were raised earlier this year about Perdue, and also his junior colleague Kelly Loeffler, for individual stock transactions in companies that might have gotten a boost from the COVID-19 crisis — transactions they suspiciously made around the time of a top-secret briefing on the pandemic they received as senators. Loeffler, who is crazy rich, bought and then sold off some stock in a software company that sold products associated with telecommuting. Perdue, who is just regular rich, did a lot of buying and selling off stock during that fraught period, with two items drawing scrutiny, as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted: “Perdue invested up to $245,000 in Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, during multiple transactions around the same time that members of Congress began sounding the alarm that more should be done to address the spread of the virus. Perdue also sold up to $165,000 in stocks for Caesar Entertainment, the casino company whose facilities have shuttered to help combat the spread of the virus.”

Both senators were cleared of wrongdoing under the very tolerant approach to conflicts of interest applied by the Senate Ethics Committee (they both claimed they were unaware of individual transactions), but it didn’t look good. Then this September, Perdue drew some scrutiny via a Daily Beast article on stock transactions involving an industry he was supposed to be overseeing as a senator:

Two weeks after Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) helped to dilute a rule that governed the prepaid debit card industry, he reported acquiring stock in a company that stood to benefit from the rollback of those regulations….

A review of Perdue’s trading of shares of Atlanta-based financial company First Data reveals that an investment firm owned by the senator and his wife, and for which he serves as a director, bought and sold substantial shares in the company from June 2017 to April 2019. Perdue has been among the most active traders in Congress. But of the more than 400 companies in which he’s bought and sold stock since taking office in 2015, he’s reported more transactions involving First Data—a major card payment processor with a significant business in prepaid cards—than any other company but one.

As with the earlier allegations, Perdue claimed third parties handled his investments, making him an innocent beneficiary.

Now comes the same Beast reporter, Sam Brodey, with a third allegation of a potential conflict of interest in Perdue’s stock transactions:

Right before he was put in charge of a powerful Senate subcommittee with jurisdiction over the U.S. Navy [in January 2019], Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) began buying up stock in a company that made submarine parts. And once he began work on a bill that ultimately directed additional Navy funding for one of the firm’s specialized products, Perdue sold off the stock, earning him tens of thousands of dollars in profits….

Scott Amey, the general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan good-government advocacy group, said it’s concerning that a lawmaker like Perdue would invest in a defense stock out of the thousands of stocks available, given his specific responsibilities on the Armed Services Committee.

To be sure, all these allegations coming to light involved transactions before Perdue finally decided to stop buying individual stocks this past April. But the aroma of foul conduct won’t quickly go away. And it’s certainly inconvenient that he and Loeffler will both face voters in the incredibly high-stakes January 5 runoffs in Georgia that will determine which party controls the Senate. Perdue’s Democratic opponent Jon Ossoff has already called the incumbent a “crook,” which led Perdue to refuse to debate him during the runoff campaign. I’m guessing he might reconsider that decision if his pollsters tell him he’s in trouble. But then again, at the current rate he might have a lot to explain if Ossoff’s oppo research file keeps swelling."
Trump told ally he's trying to get back at Democrats for questioning legitimacy of his own election,99,jxfeyg,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/19/politics/trump-democrats-election/index.html,9,1605862995.0,,"(CNN) President Donald Trump told an ally that he knows he lost, but that he is delaying the transition process and is aggressively trying to sow doubt about the election results in order to get back at Democrats for questioning the legitimacy of his own election in 2016, especially with the Russia investigation, a source familiar with the President's thinking told CNN on Thursday.

The President's refusal to concede, as CNN has previously reported , stems in part from his perceived grievance that Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama undermined his own presidency by saying Russia interfered in the 2016 election and could have impacted the outcome, people around him have said.

Trump continues to hold a grudge against those who he claims undercut his election by pointing to Russian interference efforts, and he has suggested it is fair game to not recognize Joe Biden as the President-elect, even though Clinton conceded on election night in 2016 and the Trump transition was able to begin immediately.

Trump is also continuing to process the emotional scars of losing to a candidate he repeatedly said during the campaign was an unworthy opponent whose win would amount to humiliation. He again made no public appearances on Thursday, skipping the first coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in more than six months. He is planning to participate in a virtual Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Friday, a senior administration official told CNN.

Trump has heard from a multitude of friends and business associates who have been urging him to at least let the transition begin, even if he doesn't want to concede, another source who is also familiar with the President's thinking told CNN. His answer: No. You're wrong. ""Absolutely wrong,"" according to one source.

Joy Harjo will serve a rare third term as U.S. poet laureate,7,jxf3xe,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/joy-harjo-will-serve-a-rare-third-term-as-u-s-poet-laureate,3,1605861828.0,,"Joy Harjo, the first Native American poet to serve as U.S. poet laureate, has been reappointed to a rare third term by the Library of Congress.

Harjo, an enrolled member of the Muscogee Creek Nation, was initially appointed in 2019. At the start of her tenure, Harjo explained what that honor meant for Indigenous peoples in particular.

“Some of us are astronauts. Some of us are really good at fixing cars,” she told the PBS NewsHour at the time. “But we’re human beings. And some of us write poetry … it makes a doorway of hope.”

Harjo is the second poet laureate to serve this many terms in a row since the current duties of the position were established 77 years ago. (Robert Pinsky was the first.)

Amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, Harjo “has shown how poetry can help steady us and nurture us.”

Harjo’s new term officially begins in September next year.

In a statement announcing the reappointment, Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden wrote that, amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, Harjo “has shown how poetry can help steady us and nurture us.”

In October, Harjo said she was honored to serve during a crisis like the pandemic.

“We always go to poetry in times of transformation, you know — birth, death, marriage, falling in love, out of love,” she told the NewsHour. “But here we are at a time of tremendous transformation — and where do we go? And here we are with poetry. And I get to help during this huge, transformative event that we’re all part of.”

Harjo also completed her “Living Nations, Living Words” project, which formally launched today during Native American Heritage Month. The online map collects biographies and recordings from dozens of contemporary Native poets across the country. (You can explore the archive here.)

In an introduction to the project, Harjo explains that she wanted to map these poets and their work to “counter damaging false assumptions — that indigenous peoples of our country are often invisible or are not seen as human.”

“You will not find us fairly represented, if at all, in the cultural storytelling of America, and nearly nonexistent in the American book of poetry,” she added.

The digital archive, which was developed with the Library of Congress’ Geography and Map Division, allows visitors to hear from the writers themselves. Poets like Louise Erdrich, Natalie Diaz, Ray Young Bear, Craig Santos Perez, among others, read and discuss their poems, which center on the themes of place and displacement.

Heather Cahoon, a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and poet located in Missoula, Montana, shared her poem, “Baby Out of Cut-Open Woman,” as part of the collection. In a recording online, she explains how her poem reminds its audience that “tribal stories were not imported” or “not brought here from somewhere else.”

“They were given to people right here and they are intertwined with and directly tied to this particular landscape,” she said.

For the poem “Hell’s Acre,” Sy Hoahwah, who is Yapaituka Comanche and Southern Arapaho and resides in Comanche County, Oklahoma, explains that he was nodding to the experience of being in two places at the same time.

“I consider myself an Indigenous poet, but yet also a Southern poet. And also neither. I consider myself just a man,” he added.

Harjo’s digital map is an extension of her continued work to fill the gap where American literature either hasn’t properly represented Native voices, or has only done so “in shards or little pieces here and there.”

“The story of America begins with Native presence, thoughts and words,” she said in a statement announcing her third term. “Poetry is made of word threads that weave and connect us.”

Trump's election power play: Persuade Republican legislators to do what U.S. voters did not,346,jxdbz6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-strategy/trumps-election-power-play-persuade-republican-legislators-to-do-what-u-s-voters-did-not-idUSKBN27Z30G,59,1605855456.0,,"DETROIT (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s strategy for retaining power despite losing the U.S. election is focused increasingly on persuading Republican legislators to intervene on his behalf in battleground states Democrat Joe Biden won, three people familiar with the effort said.

Having so far faced a string of losses in legal cases challenging the Nov. 3 results, Trump’s lawyers are seeking to enlist fellow Republicans who control legislatures in Michigan and Pennsylvania, which went for Trump in 2016 and for Biden in 2020, the sources said.

Michigan’s Republican House Speaker Lee Chatfield has said the person who wins the most votes will win the electoral votes of his state, where Trump trails by more than 150,000 votes.

But Chatfield and Michigan’s Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey will on Friday visit the White House at the president’s request, a source in Michigan said, adding they were going to listen and see what Trump had to say.

In the United States, a candidate becomes president by securing the most “electoral” votes rather than by winning a majority of the national popular vote. Electors, allotted to the 50 states and the District of Columbia largely based on their population, are party loyalists who pledge to support the candidate who won the popular vote in their state.

Typically, a state certifies a slate of electors based on which candidate won the popular vote, as Biden did in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

States have until Dec. 8 to meet a “safe harbor” deadline for resolving election disputes and choosing the electors who will select the president. The electors will convene as a so-called “Electoral College” on Dec. 14 to formally select the next president, who will take office on Jan. 20.

Trump’s lawyers are seeking to take the power of appointing electors away from the governors and secretaries of state and give it to friendly state lawmakers from his party, saying the U.S. Constitution gives legislatures the ultimate authority.

A person familiar with the campaign’s legal strategy said it has become a “more targeted approach towards getting the legislators engaged.”

As things stand, Biden has captured 306 electoral votes nationwide to Trump’s 232, well ahead of the 270 needed for victory. Were the combined 36 electoral votes in Michigan and Pennsylvania to go to Trump, he would trail by 270-268 electoral votes, meaning his campaign would still need to flip at least one more state to retain the White House.

A senior Trump campaign official told Reuters its plan is to cast enough doubt on vote-counting in big, Democratic cities that Republican lawmakers will have little choice but to intercede.

The campaign is betting that many of those lawmakers, who come from districts Trump won, will face a backlash from voters if they refuse to act. The campaign believes the longer they can drag this out, the more they will have an opportunity to persuade lawmakers to intervene, the official said.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll published this week suggested the Trump campaign had succeeded in stirring doubt — however unfounded — about the presidential election. The survey found about half of Republicans think Trump “rightfully won” the election he lost.

UPHILL FIGHT

Trump faces an uphill fight. Officials have said repeatedly there is no evidence of widespread voting irregularities.

Legislators in Michigan and Pennsylvania have sought not to become involved. Several leading Republicans in Michigan privately express dismay at the extent to which Trump has tried to game the election results, believing it will irreversibly tarnish the party’s image in the state for years to come.

Part of the Trump campaign effort involves trying to delay certification, the normally routine process by which election results are finalized, either through recounts or by stalling at the local level, the campaign official said.

That happened on Tuesday in Detroit, Michigan, where Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers briefly refused to certify the results, citing small discrepancies in the number of votes. The Republicans reversed themselves after hours of heated public comment, only to say in affidavits late on Wednesday that they felt threatened and wanted to rescind the certification.

One of the Republicans, Monica Palmer, said in an affidavit that the election in Wayne County “had serious process flaws which deserve investigation.” She said she voted to approve the results because she thought the state would conduct an audit.

Palmer told Reuters in a text on Thursday that Trump called her after she voted to certify the results. She said “there was no discussion of an affidavit” during the call, but did not say whether the two discussed the certification vote in detail.

Trump’s campaign dropped a federal lawsuit on Thursday challenging the election results in Michigan, citing the Wayne County officials’ affidavits.

But Tracy Wimmer, a spokeswoman for Michigan’s secretary of state, said it was too late for the Republicans to rescind their certification. “Their job is done,” she said.

Asked at a news conference on Thursday about Trump’s outreach to Michigan officials, Biden called it “outrageous” and added it was the latest evidence that Trump is among the “most irresponsible presidents in American history.”

“Most of the Republicans I’ve spoken to, including some governors, think this is debilitating. It sends a horrible message about who we are as a country,” he said.

Trump’s lawyers already have implemented the strategy in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the results of Pennsylvania, where Trump trails by 82,000 votes. In a court filing on Wednesday, his lawyers said they would ask a federal judge to either block the state from certifying the results or to declare that they were “defective” and allow the state’s Republican-led legislature to choose its own slate of electors.

Trump’s effort to enlist state lawmakers emerged after the president turned his legal efforts over to his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, a person familiar with the effort said. Trump, the person said, “didn’t like the results and he put a guy in he knows and trusts, emulates his style.”

Asked at a news conference on Thursday if the campaign’s aim was to block state certifications so Republican lawmakers could pick electors, Giuliani laughed and said the goal was to get around what he called an “outrageous iron curtain of censorship.”

Election officials and experts believe the Trump campaign has little chance of success.

“The results in Michigan and Pennsylvania are not particularly close, and the Trump campaign has come forth with no facts or legal theory that would justify disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of voters or throwing out the election results,” said Rick Hasen, an expert on election law at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law.

“This is a dangerous though almost certainly ineffective attempt to thwart the will of the voters or to delegitimize a Biden presidency based upon false claims of a stolen election,” he said."

Megan Varner/Getty Images ATLANTA — After six days of hand-counting ballots, the Georgia secretary of state’s office reaffirmed on Thursday that President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. had defeated President Trump in the state, which had long been considered a Republican stronghold. The Trump campaign asked Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia, a Republican, for a full hand recount one week after Election Day. Mr. Raffensperger announced soon after that all 159 counties would participate in a “risk-limiting audit” that would include a hand recount. The audit of roughly five million votes was completed late Wednesday. Though the result was something of a foregone conclusion, the recount took place amid escalating tension over the election outcome. The New York Times and other national news outlets called Georgia for Mr. Biden last week. But Mr. Trump has raised baseless accusations of fraud, and his allies — most notably Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Republicans who are facing tough runoff races in the state in January — disparaged Mr. Raffensperger and accused him of mismanaging the election. The process revealed a few significant hiccups in the process, with four counties — Floyd, Fayette, Walton and Douglas — discovering votes during the audit that were not part of the original count. Mr. Trump carried Floyd, Fayette and Walton Counties; Mr. Biden won Douglas County. On Thursday, Floyd County’s Board of Elections voted unanimously to fire its chief election clerk, Robert Brady, according to Dr. Melanie Conrad, a board member. Mr. Brady was fired after officials found 2,600 ballots that were left uncounted before the county’s initial certification of votes. Factoring in these newly discovered ballots, and others in counties with small discrepancies around the state, cut Mr. Biden’s lead by more than 1,200 votes. His revised margin of victory is 12,284 votes. Most counties saw only minor changes in their tallies, with the recount vote totals differing by single digits. Patrick Moore, a lawyer for the Biden campaign, predicted on Wednesday that the results would show that “the president-elect has won the state of Georgia.” The state has until Friday to certify the election results. The Trump campaign then has two business days to request a second recount, which would be conducted using high-speed scanners. Richard Fausset and

Trump tries to subvert the election, inviting Michigan G.O.P. lawmakers to the White House. President Trump also reached out personally to at least one election official in Wayne County, Mich., home of Detroit, who tried to decertify the results there. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Trump on Thursday accelerated his efforts to interfere in the nation’s electoral process, taking the extraordinary step of reaching out directly to Republican state legislators from Michigan and inviting them to the White House on Friday for discussions as the state prepares to certify President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. the winner there. Mr. Trump’s outreach to Republican officials in Michigan represented a remarkable intrusion into state and local politics: a sitting president personally contacting officials who usually play a small and invisible role in a routine process. The president requested the White House meeting with Mike Shirkey, the State Senate majority leader, and Lee Chatfield, the speaker of the Michigan House, and they will sit down with him on Friday afternoon, according to a person briefed on the arrangements. It is not clear what the president will discuss. It comes as the Trump campaign and its allies have been seeking to overturn the results of the election in multiple states through lawsuits and intrusions into the state vote certification process, often targeting cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Atlanta with large and politically powerful Black populations. Mr. Trump himself reached out personally to at least one election official in Wayne County, Mich., home of Detroit, who tried to decertify the results there. At the same time, he has made few public appearances since the election and his daily schedule often has no events on it, despite the worsening coronavirus pandemic. Some members of Mr. Trump’s team have promoted the legally dubious theory that friendly legislatures could under certain scenarios effectively subvert the popular vote and send their own, pro-Trump delegations to the Electoral College. The Trump campaign’s lead election lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, announced Thursday morning that the campaign was withdrawing a federal suit it had filed seeking to stop the certification of results in Wayne County. The campaign attached the affidavits to the dismissal notice. Mr. Biden won nearly 95 percent of the vote in Detroit and around 70 percent of the vote in Wayne County en route to winning Michigan by more than 150,000 votes. With the withdrawal of the Wayne County suit, the Trump campaign and its Republican supporters have now lost or withdrawn from all of their major legal actions in Michigan, although the state’s Supreme Court is still considering an appeal of a lower court’s decision not to halt the certification of Wayne County’s results. At a news briefing on Thursday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, was asked about what her message to Mr. Trump would be on his election efforts. “Stop spending energy to mislead about what happened in this election and spend it on a real Covid relief package,” she said. “This election was overwhelmingly decided. It was a safe, it was a secure, it was a fair election, and Joe Biden won the state of Michigan by over 150,000 votes.” She added, “The canvassers need to do their job. I expect that they will do their job and certify this result.” Maggie Haberman, Nick Corasaniti, Jim Rutenberg, Alan Feuer, Glenn Thrush and

House Democrats want the G.S.A. administrator to brief Congress on her refusal to begin the transition process. Democratic lawmakers want Emily W. Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration, to brief Congress on her decision to block transition funds for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Credit... Susan Walsh/Associated Press House Democrats on Thursday ratcheted up pressure on the head of the General Services Administration to grant President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. the money and government access set aside by law for the presidential transition process, demanding that she brief lawmakers and possibly testify in public. In a letter to Emily W. Murphy, the administrator of the sprawling agency, the chairwomen of the House Oversight and Reform and Appropriations Committees said it was past time for her to acknowledge Mr. Biden’s clear Electoral College victory and grant the letter of “ascertainment” allowing his transition team to begin the transfer of power. They argued that President Trump’s refusal to concede the election should not relieve Ms. Murphy of the legal requirement to recognize “the apparent successful candidates.” “We have been extremely patient, but we can wait no longer,” wrote the chairwomen, Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney and Nita M. Lowey of New York. “As G.S.A. administrator, it is your responsibility to follow the law and assure the safety and well-being of the United States and its people — not to submit to political pressure to violate the law and risk the consequences.” They said they wanted to question Ms. Murphy no later than Nov. 23. The course of the briefing, they added, could determine whether Ms. Murphy and two of her deputies would be summoned to testify in person on Capitol Hill. Representatives Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia and Mike Quigley of Illinois, two subcommittee chairs, also signed the letter. Ms. Murphy has not given a reason for her decision not to recognize Mr. Biden as the president-elect, though it comes as Mr. Trump and his administration have defied historical precedent and routinely insisted that he won, citing baseless claims of widespread fraud. Ms. Murphy’s office has said that it is not up to her to choose a winner and that she is following “the process laid out in the Constitution.” Her predecessors moved much more quickly to recognize apparent winners. Democrats warned there would be costs to Ms. Murphy’s inaction. Though Mr. Biden’s team is moving quickly to form a government, it cannot move into offices, formally meet with officials in federal agencies or conduct certain business involving government secrets until she signs off. “Your actions in blocking transition activities required under the law are having grave effects, including undermining the orderly transfer of power, impairing the incoming administration’s ability to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, hampering its ability to address our nation’s dire economic crisis, and endangering our national security,” the Democrats wrote. The letter came after Mr. Biden himself put public pressure on the agency to authorize the transition process and allow his team to begin preparing to take over the nation’s coronavirus response effort. Some Senate Republicans have begun to suggest that Mr. Biden should be given access to certain sensitive national security and health information, and a handful have said it is time for Ms. Murphy to act. Senate Democrats, led by Gary Peters of Michigan, dispatched a similar letter of their own, requesting a briefing and pressing Ms. Murphy to reverse course.

Federal judge blocks lawsuit seeking to halt certification of votes in Georgia. Bipartisan teams worked to audit votes in Columbus, Ga., last week. Credit... Ledger-Enquirer, via Associated Press ATLANTA — On the eve of Georgia’s deadline for certifying its statewide election results, a federal judge on Thursday rejected a last-minute effort by a supporter of President Trump to halt certification. The rejection was the latest in a string of failed efforts by the Trump campaign and its allies to legally challenge the election in courthouses around the country. The ruling also came amid news that the president was reaching out to Republican lawmakers in Michigan in an apparent effort to subvert the election results there, and a judge rejected a request by the Arizona Republican Party to postpone certification in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. The federal lawsuit seeking to halt Georgia’s certification was brought by L. Lin Wood, an Atlanta lawyer best known for his defense of Richard A. Jewell, the security guard who was falsely accused in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in 1996. Mr. Wood is an outspoken conservative and supporter of the president. In his suit, Mr. Wood claimed that Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia, a Republican, and the state elections board had violated the Constitution by creating new rules for checking absentee ballot signatures. Mr. Wood argued that the Constitution allowed state legislatures to determine only the manner in which presidential elections are conducted. Mr. Wood also claimed that Republican monitors had not been allowed to see some parts of the sweeping hand-recount of Georgia’s five million ballots, which began Friday and appears to have been largely completed by Wednesday evening. State elections officials have repeatedly said the results of the recount would not change the fact that Mr. Biden narrowly won the state. Mr. Wood also asked the court to order that the hand-recount be performed again. After a three-hour hearing, Judge Steven D. Grimberg, whom Mr. Trump nominated to the bench in the Northern District of Georgia, denied Mr. Wood’s motion for an emergency injunction. The judge said that Mr. Wood lacked standing to bring the suit, and he described the relief Mr. Wood was seeking as “quite striking.” “It would require halting the certification results in a state election in which millions of people have voted,” Judge Grimberg said. “It would interfere with an election after it has already begun, which is a significant hardship that certainly outweighs any threatened injury to this particular plaintiff.” Once Georgia certifies its election results, Mr. Trump will have two business days to demand another recount, this one conducted by machines, in the state. A few dozen right-wing activists gathered on Thursday afternoon at the State Capitol in Atlanta, where the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones had urged “freedom-loving patriots” to show up and protest the certification. Gloria Gill said she drove more than three hours from Augusta to rally for “election integrity.” “No matter which side wins and which side loses, we have to be able to trust the system,” she said. “It’s not about Trump winning; it’s about election integrity.” Richard Fausset and

Biden condemns Trump’s ‘incredible irresponsibility’ in delaying transition process. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:40 - 0:00 transcript Biden Says Trump Is Showing ‘Incredible Irresponsibility’ President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke in Wilmington, Del., on Thursday after a virtual meeting with several governors pledging that he would not pursue a national shutdown and criticized President Trump for delaying the transition process. “The governors all acknowledge that this be a massive undertaking, one of the greatest operational challenges we will have faced as a nation. One statistic that was raised by the governors: It took eight months to provide 100 million Covid tests, eight months to provide Covid tests. Just imagine how much more difficult it would be, they pointed out, if we don’t find a more efficient and effective way to provide 330 million vaccinations. The answer was I would follow the science. I am not going to shut down the economy, period. I’m going to shut down the virus that’s what I’m going to shut down.” Reporter: “So that’s ruled out?” “I’ll say it, again. No national shutdown, no national shutdown because every region, every area, every community can be different.” Reporter: “In your view, Mr. President-elect, what do you think the president is doing? What are Americans witnessing here?” “Let me choose my words here. I think they’re witnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions. And I think it is — well I don’t know his motive, but I just think it’s totally irresponsible. And I think most of the Republicans I’ve spoken to, including some governors, think this is debilitating. It’s not a — it sends a horrible message about who we are as a country.” President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke in Wilmington, Del., on Thursday after a virtual meeting with several governors pledging that he would not pursue a national shutdown and criticized President Trump for delaying the transition process. Credit Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on Thursday that President Trump was showing “incredible irresponsibility” by contesting the results of the presidential election and delaying the beginning of a transition process. “Incredibly damaging messages are being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions,” Mr. Biden said, adding that Mr. Trump’s reaction would ensure that he is remembered “as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history.” The president has continued to pursue lawsuits and peddle baseless conspiracy theories disputing his election defeat. “I don’t know his motive, but I think it’s totally irresponsible,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Trump’s actions. “It’s hard to fathom how this man thinks. I’m confident he knows he hasn’t won, and is not going to win, and we’re going to be sworn in on Jan 20.” Mr. Biden spoke in Wilmington, Del., shortly after a virtual meeting with several governors from both parties. The president-elect also said he had not ruled out taking legal action to force the head of the General Services Administration, Emily W. Murphy, to sign paperwork authorizing a presidential transition process that would give his team access to federal resources, data and personnel. But he played down that option, saying that lawsuits would “take a lot of time.” As he has several times in recent days, Mr. Biden warned that the delayed transition process made it harder for him to plan an effective response to the coronavirus pandemic and that it could slow the nationwide distribution of vaccines. “We can’t wait,” he said, calling vaccine distribution “one of the greatest operational challenges we will have faced as a nation.” He added, “There is no excuse not to share the data and let us begin to plan.”

‘Absolutely outrageous.’ Joni Ernst bristles at Trump team’s groundless claims about election results. A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell declined to comment on President Trump’s invitation to Michigan lawmakers to meet with him at the White House as he tries to subvert the Electoral College process. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Increasingly brazen attempts by President Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election drew little response on Thursday from congressional Republicans, who have stood by the president’s side and declined to acknowledge President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory. Among Republican leaders, only Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa challenged aspects of groundless claims about election wrongdoing put forward by Mr. Trump’s lawyers on Thursday, including that there had been nationally coordinated fraud by Democrats. In an interview with Fox News’s Guy Benson, Ms. Ernst defended Mr. Trump’s right to challenge the results in court. But she stressed there needed to be “proof” of wrongdoing and called accusations by Sidney Powell, one of the president’s lawyers, that lawmakers in both parties had helped rig the balloting “absolutely outrageous.” “That is an offensive comment for those of us that do stand up and represent our states in a dignified manner,” said Ms. Ernst, the fifth-ranking Senate Republican who was re-elected this month. “We believe in honesty.” She added: “I’ve worn our nation’s uniform to protect the values and freedoms that our nation espouses and to have that accusation just offhandedly thrown out there just to confuse our voters across the United States, I think that is absolutely wrong.” Ms. Ernst said she worried that sowing doubts about the election system could depress Republican turnout when voters in Georgia return to the polls in January for two runoff Senate contests, imperiling control of the Senate. The pushback came as her colleagues in leadership in the House and Senate maintained a familiar silence. A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, declined to comment on the claims made by Mr. Trump’s legal team or the president’s invitation to Michigan lawmakers to meet with him as he tries to subvert the Electoral College process and claim its electors despite losing the state. Aides to Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican House leader; and his top deputies, Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Liz Cheney of Wyoming, did not respond to requests for comment. Among the few direct critiques of Mr. Trump that emerged from a Republican was by Representative Francis Rooney of Florida, who is retiring. “Talk of manipulating the Electoral College is a very dangerous thing to be discussing in our configuration of democracy,” Mr. Rooney said. “We are out in the thin air. We really are.” He criticized his colleagues, who he said were “just hiding out” as the president steered toward ever more extreme claims. “What about self-esteem or respect?” he said. “What are these people going to do in the long run when they look back at how they just sort of slavishly devoted themselves to this guy?” Another retiring Republican, Representative Peter T. King of New York, said he was uneasy about the tone of the claims. “The president has the right to have his lawyers investigate and look for recounts,” he said. “But I don’t think we should be describing the election as fraudulent until there is evidence submitted in court and accepted.” “The rhetoric,” he added, “should be toned down.” Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who has already congratulated Mr. Biden as the victor, told CNN that he saw no evidence to back up Mr. Trump’s fraud allegations in his home state’s largest city, Detroit. “No one has seen any real identification of any real fraud,” he said, adding that it was time for the president to concede.

David Eggert/Associated Press Michigan’s Democratic congressional delegation issued a sharply worded statement on Thursday against two state lawmakers who had been invited to the White House by President Trump in a brazen attempt to upend President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s electoral victory. The state’s Senate majority leader, Mike Shirkey, and speaker of the House, Lee Chatfield, who are both Republicans, are to meet with Mr. Trump on Friday at the White House. Nine congressional members from Michigan, including Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, said “history will judge” Mr. Shirkey and Mr. Chatfield on whether they accept Mr. Biden’s victory “or simply be loyal to one man,” referring to Mr. Trump. “The continued attempts to disenfranchise voters, particularly people of color, are shocking and unacceptable,” they added. “The votes have been counted, Michiganders have spoken, and they chose Joe Biden to be our next president.” Mr. Trump’s invitation to Republican lawmakers in Michigan, a battleground state, adds to a string of attempts he and his allies have undertaken to overturn the results of the election. Mr. Shirkey has balked at the prospect of overturning Michigan’s results and publicly questioned the president for not accepting the state’s vote tally, which has Mr. Biden ahead of Mr. Trump by nearly 150,000 votes. The state’s Board of State Canvassers is scheduled to meet on Monday to review and certify the electoral results. Despite Republican protests over the certification of results in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, Michigan is expected to certify on time.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump invited Mike Shirkey, who turns 66 next month, to the White House with other Republican lawmakers — at a moment when he seems to be pressuring officials to overturn President-elect Joseph R.

Mr. Trump may have a tough sell during the meeting, which is expected to take place on Friday, and also include the Republican speaker of the Michigan House, Lee Chatfield. Mr. Shirkey has committed to heading a legislative probe into “numerous allegations” of election irregularities. But he has balked at overturning the results, and publicly questioned the president for not accepting an official accounting that shows Mr. Biden with a lead of nearly 150,000 votes. Attempts to convince state lawmakers to change the election outcome in favor of Mr. Trump is “not going to happen,” he told the nonprofit publication Bridge Michigan on Tuesday before the dramatic 24 hours of back-and-forth actions of a four-member board charged with certifying elections in Wayne County. “We are going to follow the law and follow the process,” said Mr. Shirkey, who endorsed Ben Carson in the 2016 primary but backed Mr. Trump in the general election. “I do believe there’s reason to go slow and deliberate.” Mr. Shirkey added that he did not expect any of the Trump campaign’s legal challenges would “ultimately change the results of the election.” He did not respond to requests for comment, and the White House did not say why he had been summoned. As a Republican leader in his state, Mr. Shirkey has tried to maintain political equilibrium, opposing efforts by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, to close businesses and schools to fight the pandemic — while resisting efforts to impeach her. Before being elected to the Senate in 2015, Mr. Shirkey served four years in the Michigan House of Representatives, worked for General Motors, and founded Orbitform, which produces prototypes for manufacturers at a facility in the southern part of the state. He will be forced to retire under the state’s term limits law on Jan. 1, 2023. In his interview with Bridge Michigan, he went further than most Republicans in accepting Mr. Biden’s win, urging Mr. Trump to begin facilitating the transition. “I do think that it’s inappropriate for the Trump administration to not start sharing information,” Mr. Shirkey said. Mr. Chatfield has been more equivocal, tweeting on Nov. 6 that every “legal vote needs to be counted” and “whoever gets the most votes will win Michigan! Period. End of story. Then we move on.” Eileen Sullivan and

Mitt Romney admonishes Trump’s attempts to overturn his election defeat. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah issued the strongest criticism yet by a high-ranking Republican of President Trump’s attempts to overturn the election. Credit... Samuel Corum for The New York Times In the strongest criticism of President Trump by a fellow high-ranking Republican so far, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah on Thursday night excoriated the president on Twitter for his continuing and overwhelmingly unsuccessful efforts to overturn his election defeat earlier this month to Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said that the president had exhausted his legal challenges in several battleground states and had resorted to trying to defy the will of the voters. His rebuke of Mr. Trump came on the same day that the president invited Republican state leaders in Michigan to the White House to discuss their efforts to stop the certification of the election results in the state. “Having failed to make even a plausible case of widespread fraud or conspiracy before any court of law, the president has now resorted to overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election,” Mr. Romney wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American president.” The relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Romney has been tempestuous, with Mr. Romney casting the lone vote by a Republican in the Senate to convict the president of one article of impeachment in February in an otherwise party-line vote. Mr. Trump was acquitted by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. Mr. Romney was not the only member of the Senate to suggest on Thursday that Mr. Trump should stand down. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a statement on Thursday night that it was telling that Mr. Trump’s campaign lawyers had refused to “actually allege grand fraud.” “Because there are legal consequences for lying to judges,” Mr. Sasse said. “President Trump lost Michigan by more than 100,000 votes, and the campaign and its allies have lost in or withdrawn from all five lawsuits in Michigan for being unable to produce any evidence.” Mr. Sasse said that the efforts of the Trump campaign and Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, to attack the integrity of the election had caused damage. “Wild press conferences erode public trust,” Mr. Sasse said. “So no, obviously Rudy and his buddies should not pressure electors to ignore their certification obligations under the statute. We are a nation of laws, not tweets.” Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.

David Perdue profited from a Navy contractor’s stock while overseeing the Naval fleet. Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, is a millionaire and formerly prolific trader of individual stocks. Mr. Perdue will face off against Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, in a runoff election in January. Credit... Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times Senator David Perdue, one of two Republican senators from Georgia facing runoff elections in January, began making large and ultimately profitable purchases of shares in a Navy contractor in 2018 just before taking over as chair of a Senate subcommittee overseeing the Navy fleet. The disclosure, first reported Wednesday by The Daily Beast, comes as both Mr. Perdue and Georgia’s other senator, Kelly Loeffler, have been under fire for their stock trades. Mr. Perdue, a millionaire and formerly a prolific trader of individual stocks, announced in May that he would divest from his large individual stock holdings after questions were raised about his well-timed purchases of Pfizer stock in February, after senators were briefed on the coronavirus threat. At a debate last month, Mr. Perdue’s Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, called him a “crook” who sought to profit from the pandemic. Mr. Perdue has since twice refused to debate Mr. Ossoff. “Senator Perdue doesn’t manage his trades, they are handled by outside financial advisors without his prior input or approval,” a spokeswoman for Mr. Perdue said in response to the report about Mr. Perdue’s trades in shares of the Navy contractor, BWX Technologies, which supplies nuclear components and fuel for submarines and aircraft carriers. In the six weeks before the January 2019 announcement that Mr. Perdue was taking over as chair of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower, he bought a total of $40,000 to $290,000 worth of BWX on dates when prices averaged about $40 per share, according to a Times analysis of Senate filings. The filings give only a value range for stock transactions, making it impossible to know how many shares are bought and sold. In the month after his appointment, the stock jumped more than 25 percent. Mr. Perdue sold his stock on dates from February to July 2019 when prices averaged more than $50 per share. In June of that year, he announced that he had helped push through additional funding for the Navy in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020, including money for an extra submarine. As subcommittee chair, Mr. Perdue has been a strong proponent of increasing Navy spending. “In this era of great power competition, there is no question our Navy needs to grow larger and become more capable,” he told a committee meeting in December 2019, after he had sold his BWX shares. While not officially prohibited, individual stock trades by members of Congress have long raised questions, according to Kedric Payne, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group. “This is just a perfect example of why many members of Congress have decided on their own to not trade individual stocks, even though there is no evidence of insider trading. It still begs the question of whether his official actions are somehow motivated by personal interest.” “David Perdue's corruption and self-dealing are flagrant,” Mr. Ossoff said in response to the Daily Beast article. “He is blatantly exploiting his office to line his own pockets. This conduct is utterly inexcusable.” A spokesman for BWX Technologies, Jud Simmons, said the company was not aware that Mr. Perdue had been a shareholder until recent media reports. “Like other companies, BWX Technologies is not aware of, and does not control, purchases of its stock by individuals,” Mr. Simmons said.

Hispanic lawmakers ask Biden to name five Latinos to his cabinet. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has previously objected to committing to appointing a certain number of Latino cabinet members. Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Hispanic lawmakers in Congress are calling on President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to name five Latinos to his cabinet, the latest effort in a broader push for Latino representation throughout the incoming administration. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus made that request in a letter on Thursday to Jeffrey D. Zients, a co-chair of the Biden transition. The letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, also urged Mr. Biden to put at least one Latino in the top four cabinet positions — secretary of state, Treasury secretary, defense secretary and attorney general — and said it was “imperative that Latinos account for about 20 percent of personnel across all suites of federal government.” The letter from Hispanic lawmakers comes amid an effort by Latino organizations, called Proyecto 20%, that seeks to ensure that at least 20 percent of Mr. Biden’s political appointees across the federal government are Latino. Mr. Biden has promised an administration that “looks like America,” and he named three Latinos to senior White House positions this week. A spokeswoman for the Biden transition, Jennifer Molina, said on Thursday that Mr. Biden “has been intentional in building teams that are reflective of the diversity of America,” adding, “He is committed to continuing this approach as he staffs his administration and prepares to tackle the challenges we are facing as a nation.” Mr. Biden has previously objected to committing to appointing a certain number of Latino cabinet members, but he has promised to have Latino representation in his cabinet. At an event in Nevada in January, he was asked if he would commit to having four Latino cabinet members. He declined to commit to a number but said, “There will be a significant number of Latinos in my cabinet, and you’ll see Latinx women in my cabinet.” Thomas Kaplan and

Top business groups call on the Trump administration to start a formal transition to Biden. The calls from business groups could bring additional pressure on top Republicans in Congress to finally recognize President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the winner of the election. Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Business leaders in Washington and on Wall Street are increasingly calling on the Trump administration to recognize Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the presidential election and initiate a formal transition ahead of Mr. Biden’s inauguration in January. Some of the biggest corporate lobbying groups — including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers — supported President Trump in his push to cut taxes and roll back regulations while in office but are now breaking with the president as he pushes unfounded claims of fraud and wages a protracted court battle in an attempt to overturn the election results. The business pressure comes as the General Services Administration refuses to issue a letter of “ascertainment,” which would allow Mr. Biden’s transition team to begin the transfer of power, and as top Republicans refuse to formally concede that Mr. Trump lost. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has yet to recognize Mr. Biden’s victory publicly, but said this week that there would be an “orderly transition of power” before the next inauguration. The National Association of Manufacturers on Wednesday called on the head of the G.S.A. to formally initiate the transition between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden. “It’s imperative that our nation has a president and advisors who are fully prepared to lead our nation on Inauguration Day given the magnitude of the challenges ahead and the threats to our economic and national security, and most importantly, to the public health,” wrote the manufacturing group’s leaders, including its president and chief executive, Jay Timmons, and the chief executives of the chemicals giant Dow and Trane Technologies. “We call on the Trump administration to work cooperatively with President-elect Biden and his team,” the letter said. On Thursday, the chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, told Axios that “while the Trump administration can continue litigating to confirm election outcomes, for the sake of Americans’ safety and well-being, it should not delay the transition a moment longer.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his allies are taking increasingly frantic steps to subvert the results of the 2020 election, including summoning state legislators to the White House as part of a longshot bid to overturn Joe Biden’s victory.

Among other last-ditch tactics: personally calling local election officials who are trying to rescind their certification votes in Michigan, suggesting in a legal challenge that Pennsylvania set aside the popular vote there and pressuring county officials in Arizona to delay certifying vote tallies.

Election law experts see it as the last, dying gasps of the Trump campaign and say Biden is certain to walk into the Oval Office come January. But there is great concern that Trump’s effort is doing real damage to public faith in the integrity of U.S. elections.

“It’s very concerning that some Republicans apparently can’t fathom the possibility that they legitimately lost this election,” said Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who researches and teaches election law.

“We depend on democratic norms, including that the losers graciously accept defeat,” he said. “That seems to be breaking down.”

Trump’s own election security agency has declared the 2020 presidential election to have been the most secure in history. Days after that statement was issued, Trump fired the agency’s leader.

The increasingly desperate and erratic moves have no reasonable chance of changing the outcome of the 2020 election, where Biden has now received more votes than any other presidential candidate in history and has clinched the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.

But the president’s constant barrage of baseless claims, his work to personally sway local officials who certify votes and his allies’ refusal to admit he lost is likely to have a lasting negative impact on the country. Legions of his supporters don’t believe he lost.

“It’s about trying to set up the conditions where half of the country believes that there are only two possibilities, either they win or the election was stolen,” said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law scholar and professor at Loyola Law School. “And that’s not a democracy.”

The two GOP canvassers in Michigan’s Wayne County said in a statement late Wednesday they lacked confidence that the election was fair and impartial. “There has been a distinct lack of transparency throughout the process,” they said. But there has been no evidence of impropriety or fraud in Michigan, election officials have said.

Trump’s allies have homed in on the way that the president’s early lead in Michigan and some other states on Election Night slipped away as later votes came, casting it as evidence of something nefarious.

But a massive influx of mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic leaned largely to Biden, who encouraged his supporters to vote by mail, and those votes were the last to be counted. So it appeared Trump had an edge when he really didn’t.

In fact, Biden crushed Trump in Wayne County, a Democratic stronghold that includes Detroit, by a more than 2-1 margin on his way to winning Michigan by 154,000 votes, according to unofficial results.

Earlier this week, the county’s two Republicans canvassers blocked the certification of votes there. They later relented and the results were certified. But a person familiar with the matter said Trump reached out to the canvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, on Tuesday evening after the revised vote to express gratitude for their support. Then, on Wednesday, Palmer and Hartmann signed affidavits saying they believed the county vote “should not be certified.”

They cannot rescind their votes, according to the Michigan secretary of state. The four-member state canvassing board is expected to meet Monday and also is split with two Democrats and two Republicans.

Trump appears intent on pushing the issue. He has invited Michigan’s Republican legislative leaders, Senate Majority Mike Shirkey and House Speaker Lee Chatfield, to the White House, according to two officials familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. The two have agreed to go, according to one official, but they haven’t commented publicly, and it’s not clear what the purpose of the meeting is.

The Michigan Legislature would be called on to select electors if Trump succeeded in convincing the state’s board of canvassers not to certify Biden’s 154,000-vote victory in the state. But both legislative leaders have indicated they will not try to overturn Biden’s win.

Full Coverage: Election 2020

“Michigan law does not include a provision for the Legislature to directly select electors or to award electors to anyone other than the person who received the most votes,” Shirkey’s spokeswoman said last week.

During a press conference in Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday, Biden said Americans are “witnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages are being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions.”

He added, “I just think it’s totally irresponsible.”

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, one of Trump’s most vocal GOP critics, accused Trump of resorting to “overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election.” Romney added, “It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President.”

A few hours earlier, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and others had held a press conference to allege a widespread Democratic election conspiracy involving multiple states and suspect voting machines. But election officials across the country have said repeatedly there was no widespread fraud.

Many of the allegations of fraud stem from poll watchers who filed affidavits included with lawsuits in battleground states aimed at delaying vote certification. Those affidavits lean into innuendo and unsupported suggestions of fraud.

For example, they refer to suitcases in a polling place, but make no suggestion that ballots were being secretly counted. There are allegations of ballots being duplicated — something routinely done when a ballot is physically damaged. There are claims that partisan poll watchers were too far away to observe well and therefore something fishy was probably going on. But they don’t have proof. Poll watchers have no auditing role in elections; they are volunteer observers.

Giuliani cited a few sworn affidavits that he said showed a vast Democratic conspiracy, but added that he could not reveal much of the evidence. One he cited was from Jessy Jacob, identified as a city employee in Detroit who said she saw other workers coaching voters to cast ballots for Biden and the Democrats.

A judge who refused to block certification of Detroit-area results noted that Jacob’s claims included no “date, location, frequency or names of employees” and that she only came forward after unofficial results indicated Biden had won Michigan.

Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who joined Giuliani, said more evidence would be forthcoming and that Trump’s allies would have more success in courts going forward. But so far, most of their legal actions have been dismissed.

Chris Krebs, the Trump administration election official fired last week over the comments about the security of 2020, tweeted: “That press conference was the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history. And possibly the craziest.”

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., tweeted: “Rudy and his buddies should not pressure electors to ignore their certification obligations under the statute. We are a nation of laws, not tweets.”

In Pennsylvania, where the Trump campaign is challenging the election results in federal court, a legal team led by Giuliani suggested in a filing Wednesday that the judge order the Republican-led state legislature to pick delegates to the Electoral College, potentially throwing the state’s 20 electoral votes to Trump. A judge canceled an evidentiary hearing in the case.

In Arizona, the Republican Party is pressuring county officials to delay certifying results. The GOP lost a bid on Thursday to postpone certification in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous. In northwestern Arizona, Mohave County officials postponed their certification until next week.

Judge John Hannah ruled without explanation, except to bar the party from refiling the case. The judge promised a full explanation in the future.

Maricopa County officials are expected to certify elections results on Friday.

Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes, and Maricopa County put him over the top. The county performed a hand count of some ballots the weekend after the election, which showed its machine counts were 100% accurate. The same was found Wednesday during routine post-election accuracy tests.

In Georgia, where officials have been auditing the results of the presidential race, Trump has repeatedly attacked the process and called it “a joke.”

He has also made repeated incorrect assertions that Georgia election officials are unable to verify signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. In fact, Georgia requires that they be checked.

The Associated Press called Biden the winner of Georgia and its 16 electoral votes on Thursday night.

A top Georgia election official said earlier Thursday that a hand tally of ballots cast in the presidential race had been completed, and that the results affirmed Biden’s narrow lead over Trump. The secretary of state’s office planned to release results of the audit later Thursday.

During the hand tally, several counties found previously uncounted ballots that the secretary of state’s office has said would reduce Biden’s lead to just under 13,000 votes, with roughly 5 million total votes cast. Georgia law allows a candidate to request a recount within two business days of certification if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. That recount would be done using machines.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — President Donald Trump filed Wednesday for a recount of Wisconsin’s two largest Democratic counties, paying the required $3 million cost and alleging that they were the sites of the “worst irregularities” although no evidence of illegal activity has been presented.

The recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties will begin Friday and must be done by Dec. 1. Democrat Joe Biden received 577,455 votes in those two counties compared with 213,157 for Trump. Biden won statewide by 20,608 votes, based on canvassed results submitted by the counties.

“The official canvass results reaffirmed Joe Biden’s clear and resounding win in Wisconsin after Wisconsin voters turned out to cast their ballots in record numbers,” said Biden campaign spokesman Nate Evans. “A cherry-picked and selective recounting of Milwaukee and Dane County will not change these results.”

Milwaukee County is the state’s largest, home to the city of Milwaukee, and Black people make up about 27% of the population, more than any other county. Dane County is home to the liberal capital city of Madison and the flagship University of Wisconsin campus.

“The people of Wisconsin deserve to know whether their election processes worked in a legal and transparent way,” said Wisconsin attorney Jim Troupis, who is working with the Trump campaign. “Regrettably, the integrity of the election results cannot be trusted without a recount in these two counties and uniform enforcement of Wisconsin absentee ballot requirements. We will not know the true results of the election until only the legal ballots cast are counted.”

Dean Knudson, a Republican member of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said Trump raised “significant legal questions that have never been adjudicated in Wisconsin.”

But a fellow commission member, Democrat Mark Thomsen, said Trump was trying to change the rules of the election after he lost, but only in two counties.

“That’s like losing the Super Bowl and then saying ‘I want a review of a certain play using different rules than what applied to the rest of the game,’” Thomsen said. “That is the essence of hypocrisy and cheating and dishonesty.”

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, called the recount “an attack on cities, on minorities, on places that have historically voted Democratic. Don’t let anyone fool you that this is about irregularities.”

On Tuesday in Michigan, Republicans on a canvassing board for the county that includes Detroit temporarily stopped certification of the vote after claiming that poll books in certain parts of the majority-Black city were out of balance. The deadlock brought claims of racism from Democrats before the board later voted unanimously to certify the results,

The Wisconsin recount will be done as the state continues to ride a surge of coronavirus cases, breaking records this week for deaths, new positives and hospitalizations. Recount organizers were planning to do the work in large convention centers so workers and observers could be properly distanced.

“It’s not surprising at all that Donald Trump, the Trump campaign, wants to have one last mass gathering that will put people’s health in peril,” Barrett said.

The Wisconsin Elections Commission late Wednesday night voted to approve issuing an order on Thursday to commence the recount. The vote came after five hours of wrangling over whether to reference in the order their own recount manual that gives local elections officials guidelines on how to conduct the recount.

Ultimately, the commission issued the order without any reference to the manual.

Democrats pushed for changes they said would bring guidelines in the manual into line with the law, but the commission deadlocked after Republicans objected to modifications after Trump had filed for the recount.

Democrats said any disagreement over what the manual or the law says related to how recounts should be conducted will be fought in court.

Trump’s campaign made a variety of claims Wednesday, including that clerks wrongly added missing information on returned absentee ballots.

But guidance from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, in place since 2016, says that clerks can fix missing witness address components on the envelopes that contain absentee ballots if they have reliable information. That guidance, passed unanimously by the bipartisan elections commission, has been in place for 11 statewide elections without objection.

The elections commission said that there were no corrections to actual absentee ballots contained inside the envelopes, as some have claimed. The witness signature and address information is all contained on the envelope in which the ballot is sent.

Full Coverage: Election 2020

The Trump campaign is also alleging that thousands of voters improperly got around Wisconsin’s photo ID requirement by claiming they were indefinitely confined and therefore didn’t have to present a photo ID in order to return their absentee ballot.

Wisconsin law requires all voters to show an acceptable photo ID to vote both in person and by mail. It does provide exceptions for citizens who are indefinitely confined because of age, physical illness or infirmity or are disabled for an indefinite period.

The Wisconsin Republican Party sued Democratic Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell in March, before the state’s spring primary, over advice he had posted on his Facebook page that voters could declare themselves indefinitely confined due to the pandemic. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ordered McDonell to stop issuing guidance that is different from official language approved by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The Trump campaign alleged that “the damage was already done” before McDonell was ordered to remove the language.

The Trump campaign also alleges that local election clerks issued absentee ballots to voters without requiring an application, in violation of state law. Trump’s complaint alleges that 60,000 votes were cast by people who didn’t submit a written application, but offered no evidence.

Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said there was “no proof” to back up that claim.

“I would encourage them to provide the proof,” he said.

Elections commission members Knudson and Thomsen both said they did not know what Trump was referring to in that portion of the complaint.

Trump also claimed that observers in Milwaukee were kept too far away to observe the counting of ballots.

“Once observational access is provided during a recount, mistakes, violations of the law (in addition to the open access violations already known) and fraud will be discovered,” the complaint said.

Election leaders in Milwaukee and Dane counties said they would live stream the recount to be done at convention centers in both Milwaukee and Madison, with room for observers in person. The recount will continue in both cities over the weekend, taking off only for Thanksgiving, until complete.

“We know the result will be the same as it was,” McDonell said. “It’s what we saw across the state four years ago and this election, from my perspective, ran very smoothly.”

Recounts in Wisconsin and across the country have historically resulted in very few vote changes. A 2016 presidential recount in Wisconsin netted Trump an additional 131 votes.

Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes that year, and opposed the recount brought by Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

“The people have spoken and the election is over,” Trump said at the time. “We must accept this result and then look to the future.”

After the recount was done and his victory was confirmed, Trump again took to Twitter.

“The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what — we just picked up an additional 131 votes,” Trump tweeted at the time after the recount was done. “The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!”

Lindsey Graham arrives for a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on November 10 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Susan Walsh/Pool/Getty Images

A staffer for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Tuesday that he participated in a controversial phone call with Sen. Lindsey Graham and said he heard Graham ask if state officials could throw out ballots.

The comments from the staffer, election implementation manager Gabriel Sterling, corroborate Raffensperger recent claims about the phone call with Graham, who is one of President Donald Trump’s most outspoken allies.

Earlier this week, Raffensperger accused Graham of asking him to “look hard and see how many ballots you could throw out,” referring to absentee ballots that skewed heavily in favor of President-elect Joe Biden. Graham denied the claim, saying that it was “ridiculous” that he tried to pressure Raffensperger to throw out legally cast ballots.

In response to a question from CNN about the incident, Sterling said on Tuesday, “What I heard was basically discussions about absentee ballots and if a potentially … if there was a percentage of signatures that weren’t really, truly matching, is there some point we could get to, we could say somebody went to a courtroom could say well, let’s throw (out) all these ballots because we have no way of knowing because the ballots are separated.”

“There is no physical ability for this office to do anything along those lines,” Sterling continued, referring to throwing out absentee ballots that have already been deemed legal by local election officials. “If somebody wanted to go that route, they could go the court route.”

Graham’s comments “might have gone a little to the edge of” what people deem acceptable, Sterling said, but added that he understands why Raffensperger and Graham might have interpreted the conversation differently.

“The President is going to continue to fight, his supporters continue to fight,” Sterling said. “Our job is to continue to follow the law, and we were answering process questions… that’s what we were doing on the call.”"
Half of Republicans say Biden won because of a 'rigged' election: Reuters/Ipsos poll,351,jwgeh9,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/half-of-republicans-say-biden-won-because-of-a-rigged-election-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN27Y1AJ,77,1605737369.0,,"(Reuters) - About half of all Republicans believe President Donald Trump “rightfully won” the U.S. election but that it was stolen from him by widespread voter fraud that favored Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll.

The Nov. 13-17 opinion poll showed that Trump’s open defiance of Biden’s victory in both the popular vote and Electoral College appears to be affecting the public’s confidence in American democracy, especially among Republicans.

Altogether, 73% of those polled agreed that Biden won the election while 5% thought Trump won. But when asked specifically whether Biden had “rightfully won,” Republicans showed they were suspicious about how Biden’s victory was obtained.

Fifty-two percent of Republicans said that Trump “rightfully won,” while only 29% said that Biden had rightfully won.

Asked why, Republicans were much more concerned than others that state vote counters had tipped the result toward Biden: 68% of Republicans said they were concerned that the election was “rigged,” while only 16% of Democrats and one-third of independents were similarly worried.

Even before winning the 2016 election, Trump kept up a drumbeat of complaints about the process, claiming without evidence that it was unfair to him.

Since Biden amassed enough electoral votes to win the White House on Nov. 7, Trump has ramped up those criticisms, telling his supporters that he is the victim of widespread illegal voting.

Trump has failed to give any proof for his claims and has not been able to back them up in court, however. Republicans announced this week that they were dropping federal election lawsuits in Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

The poll showed that more Americans appear to be more suspicious about the U.S. election process than they were four years ago.

Altogether, 55% of adults in the United States said they believed the Nov. 3 presidential election was “legitimate and accurate,” which is down 7 points from a similar poll that ran shortly after the 2016 election. The 28% who said they thought the election was “the result of illegal voting or election rigging” is up 12 points from four years ago.

The poll showed Republicans were much more likely to be suspicious of Trump’s loss this year than Democrats were when Hillary Clinton lost four years ago.

In 2016, 52% of Democrats said Hillary Clinton’s loss to Trump was “legitimate and accurate,” even as reports emerged of Russian attempts to influence the outcome. This year, only 26% of Republicans said they thought Trump’s loss was similarly legitimate.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,346 respondents, including 598 Democrats and 496 Republicans, and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 5 percentage points."

DALLAS (AP) — The FBI is investigating allegations that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton broke the law in using his office to benefit a wealthy donor, according to two people with knowledge of the probe.

Federal agents are looking into claims by former members of Paxton’s staff that the high-profile Republican committed bribery, abuse of office and other crimes to help Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, the people told The Associated Press. They insisted on anonymity to discuss the investigation because it is ongoing.

Confirmation of the criminal probe marks mounting legal peril for Paxton, who’s denied wrongdoing and refused calls for his resignation since his top deputies reported him to federal authorities at the end of September.

A criminal defense attorney for Paxton, Philip Hilder, declined to comment. Spokespersons in the attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It’s unclear how far the FBI is into investigating the allegations against Paxton. An agency spokeswoman in San Antonio declined to comment.

Paxton is accused of using his position as Texas’ top law enforcement official to benefit Paul in several ways, according to seven senior lawyers in the attorney general’s office and the agency’s head of law enforcement. Central to their claims is the fact that Paxton hired an outside lawyer to investigate the developer’s allegations that the FBI improperly searched his home and offices last year.

Each of Paxton’s accusers has resigned, been put on leave or been fired since reporting him. Last week, four of them filed a state whistleblower lawsuit against the attorney general, claiming he ousted them as retribution.

The full nature of Paxton and Paul’s connection remains unclear. In 2018, Paul donated $25,000 to the attorney general’s reelection campaign. The developer also said in a recent deposition that Paxton recommended a woman for her job with his company.

Two people previously told The Associated Press that Paxton acknowledged in 2018 having an extramarital affair with the woman , who was then a state Senate aide. The people spoke on condition of anonymity due to fears about retaliation.

Paxton said in a Tuesday statement to the Austin American-Stateman that, “after reviewing the claims made by former employees of this office, their allegations are overblown, based upon assumptions, and to a large degree misrepresent the facts.”

Paxton has spent most of his tenure in office maintaining his innocence in the face of an indictment on unrelated securities fraud charges. The case has been stalled for years over legal challenges.

"Wayne County Board of Canvassers change course, unanimously vote to certify election results",19,jw7iwq,https://www.wxyz.com/news/coronavirus/board-of-canvassers-deadlocked-on-certifying-election-results-in-wayne-county,31,1605696132.0,,"WAYNE COUNTY, Mich. (WXYZ) — After initially being deadlocked on a vote to certify the election, The Wayne County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously to certify election results Tuesday evening. The motion to hold another vote came following hours of public comments condemning Republican canvassers' decisions to vote against the certification.

The first vote tied 2 to 2 along party lines. But just before 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, the board filed a motion and voted to certify the results under the stipulation that Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson does a comprehensive audit of the election in the county.

President Trump also tweeting praise to canvassers who initially blocked the certification, saying ""Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!""

Mayor Mike Duggan responding the to reversal in a statement saying, ""Glad to see common sense prevailed in the end. Thank you to all those citizens who spoke up so passionately – you made the difference!""

There has been a whirlwind of unproven allegations of fraud and a string of lawsuits since the election two weeks ago. 7 Action News is told the canvassers' initial vote came after many Detroit precincts were found to be out of balance.

JUST NOW: Wayne County Canvassers are spilt on certifying election results as the deadline looms.

That means the number of votes are not in line with the number of voters. However, the variance is said to be small with no evidence of fraud or systemic failure.

If the re-vote did not happen, it would be left up to the state to canvass and certify Wayne County's election results.

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson responding to the deadlock in a tweet saying, ""Should the current decision of the Board of Wayne County Canvassers hold through the adjournment of today's meeting, the Board of State Canvassers will be responsible for certifying the Wayne County election.""

My statement on the actions taken during today’s meeting of the Board of Wayne County Canvassers. pic.twitter.com/Vb2TRpiLdJ — Jocelyn Benson (@JocelynBenson) November 17, 2020

Biden campaign spokesman Michael Gwin released this statement:

""President-elect Biden convincingly won Michigan by 14 times the margin of Donald Trump in 2016 and state election officials have made clear that there's zero evidence of fraud, despite the Trump campaign's desperate lies. The votes of all of the more than 5.5 million Michiganders who participated in the 2020 election will continue to be quickly certified and reaffirm the fact that Joe Biden decisively won Michigan.""

Governor Whitmer responded to the events with the following statement:

In refusing to approve the results of the election in Wayne County, the two Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers have placed partisan politics above their legal duty to certify the election results. The people have spoken: Joe Biden won Michigan by more than 140,000 votes. Today’s action is a blatant attempt to undermine the will of the voters. The process, however, will move forward. Under Michigan law, the Board of State of Canvassers will now finish the job and I have every expectation they will certify the results when the job is done.

The head of the Michigan Republican Party Laura Cox issued the following statement about the vote;

The people of Michigan deserve to know what happened in Wayne County on Election Day and the days following. I am proud that, due to the efforts of the Michigan Republican Party, the Republican National Committee and the Trump Campaign, enough evidence of irregularities and potential voter fraud was uncovered resulting in the Wayne County Board of Canvassers refusing to certify their election results. This action will allow more time for us to get to the bottom of these deeply troubling irregularities. The people of Michigan deserve fair, open and transparent elections, and we will continue to fight for just that.

The Michigan Democratic Party condemned the vote in the following statement:

In an outrageous display of partisan posturing, the two Republicans on the Wayne County Board of Canvassers refused to certify the election results. Monica Palmer and William Hartmann have chosen to tarnish their personal legacy by picking up the GOP banner of making allegations without any evidence. For the Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers to buy into conspiracy theories and completely disregard the will of the voters in Michigan is not only shameful but a complete dereliction of duties.



It was made clear by the comments during the meeting by Palmer and Hartmann, that they have no true understanding of the task they have been charged with and zero understanding of Michigan statutes governing recounts. This action does away with a long and proud history of Wayne County Board of Canvassers acting in a truly bipartisan fashion, protecting the sanctity of the vote and instilling confidence in Wayne County residents that their votes were indeed counted and counted correctly. Which is exactly what happened this year. The actions of Palmer and Hartman disrespects and disregards the voters of Wayne County, the incredibly hard work of the dedicated poll workers and clerks of Wayne County all in the name of partisan showboating.



Before public comment concluded and the business of the meeting was done this evening, Laura Cox, Chair of the MIGOP released a statement taking credit for persuading the Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers refusing to certify the election results. This just confirms that this is nothing more than political showboating based on partisan positioning. Even during the meeting, Palmer and Hartmann conceded that their actions would not impact any results.



While bringing shame on themselves and MIGOP leadership, Palmer and Hartmann have now shown us they are willing to violate the oath they took when they were appointed to the Board of Canvassers.

The Wayne County Board of canvassers are scheduled to reconvene remotely on Nov. 18 at 1:30 p.m.

Graham denied he pressured Raffensperger to find ways to toss out legal votes, saying that he was trying to figure out how votes were verified and that he thought Georgia ""has some protections that maybe other states don't have.""

"Why Obama Fears for Our Democracy - In an exclusive interview, the former president identifies the greatest threats to the American experiment, explains why he’s still hopeful, and opens up about his new book.",28,jvai5x,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/why-obama-fears-for-our-democracy/617087/,16,1605575324.0,,"In an exclusive interview, the former president identifies the greatest threats to the American experiment, explains why he’s still hopeful, and opens up about his new book.

Barack Obama was describing to me the manner in which the Mongol emperor and war-crimes innovator Genghis Khan would besiege a town. “They gave you two choices,” he said. “‘If you open the gates, we’ll just kill you quickly and take your women and enslave your children, but we won’t slaughter them. But if you hold out, then we’ll slowly boil you in oil and peel off your skin.’” This was not meant to be commentary on the Trump presidency—not directly, at least. In any case, Obama has more respect for Genghis Khan than he has for Donald Trump. He raised the subject of Genghis Khan in order to make a specific, extremely Obama-like point: If you think today’s world is grim, simply cast your mind back 800 years to the steppes of Central Asia. “Compare the degree of brutality and venality and corruption and just sheer folly that you see across human history with how things are now,” he said. “It’s not even close.” We were sitting at opposite ends of a long table in his office suite in the West End district of Washington. The offices were empty, except for a couple of aides and a discreet Secret Service detail. Obama was in a good mood, happy to discuss the work that has consumed him for more than three years: the writing of A Promised Land, his presidential memoir—or what turns out to be (because he has much to say about many things) the first of two volumes of his presidential memoir. The first volume’s 768 pages carry him from childhood to the bin Laden raid of 2011. A publication date for the next installment, which will presumably cover such issues as the Syrian civil war, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the Iran nuclear deal, has not yet been announced.

From the April 2016 issue: The Obama doctrine A Promised Land is an unusual presidential memoir in many ways: unusually interior, unusually self-critical, unusually modern (this is the first presidential memoir, I believe, to use the term ethereal bisexual to describe an unrequited love interest), and unusually well written. The book does suffer at times from a general too-muchness, and it has its arid stretches, although to be fair, no one has yet invented a way to inject poetry into extended explanations of cap-and-trade, or Mitch McConnell’s motivations. We covered a lot of ground in our face-to-face discussion, which took place on Wednesday, and in a follow-up call on Friday. The broadest subject of our conversation was the arc of the moral universe: Does it still bend toward justice? Does it even exist? When Obama was elected 12 years ago, the arc seemed more readily visible, at least to that swath of the country interested in seeing someone other than a white male become president. But he now recognizes that the change he represented triggered an almost instantaneous backlash, one that culminated in the “birther” conspiracy that catapulted its prime propagandist, Donald Trump, to the White House. “What I think is indisputable is that I signified a shift in power. Just my mere presence worried folks, in some cases explicitly, in some cases subconsciously,” Obama said. “And then there were folks around to exploit that and tap into that. If a Fox News talking head asks, when Michelle and I dap, give each other a fist bump, ‘Is that a terrorist fist bump?,’ that’s not a particularly subtle reference. If there’s a sign in opposition to the ACA in which I’m dressed as an African witch doctor with a bone through my nose, that’s not a hard thing to interpret.”

For Obama, though, the overarching story of America, and all humanity, is one of fitful progress—and nothing about the past four years has seemed to change his mind. Joe Biden’s election is proof that America moves forward; the persistence of racial animus and resentment-driven populism represents the difficulty of maintaining momentum. Obama’s you-think-you-have-it-so-bad invocation of Genghis Khan was prompted by a passage I read aloud to him. It is a brief peak-Obama, “Ozymandias”-inflected passage about a visit to Egypt. Obama recalls brooding over a face of a forgotten figure etched into an ancient wall, a face that resembled his. “All of it was forgotten now, none of it mattered, the pharaoh, the slave, and the vandal all long turned to dust. Just as every speech I’d delivered, every law I passed and decision I made, would be forgotten. Just as I and all those I loved would someday turn to dust.” I noted the presence in this passage of a kind of paralyzing self-awareness (“True,” he said), but he told me he included this rumination to make a point about the long view. “That scene of me going through the pyramids—it’s not an empty exercise; there’s a purpose to it. So much of whether you’re optimistic or pessimistic depends on the time frame,” he said, invoking the specter of Genghis Khan. He went on: “What I’ve always believed is that humanity has the capacity to be kinder, more just, more fair, more rational, more reasonable, more tolerant. It is not inevitable. History does not move in a straight line. But if you have enough people of goodwill who are willing to work on behalf of those values, then things can get better.”

Which brought him to his main point: “America as an experiment is genuinely important to the world not because of the accidents of history that made us the most powerful nation on Earth, but because America is the first real experiment in building a large, multiethnic, multicultural democracy. And we don’t know yet if that can hold. There haven’t been enough of them around for long enough to say for certain that it’s going to work,” he said. Barack Obama: I’m not yet ready to abandon the possibility of America The threats to American democracy—and to the broader cause of freedom—are many, he said. He was withering on the subject of Donald Trump, but acknowledged that Trump himself is not the root of the issue. “I’m not surprised that somebody like Trump could get traction in our political life,” he said. “He’s a symptom as much as an accelerant. But if we were going to have a right-wing populist in this country, I would have expected somebody a little more appealing.” Trump, Obama noted, is not exactly an exemplar of traditional American manhood. “I think about the classic male hero in American culture when you and I were growing up: the John Waynes, the Gary Coopers, the Jimmy Stewarts, the Clint Eastwoods, for that matter. There was a code … the code of masculinity that I grew up with that harkens back to the ’30s and ’40s and before that. There’s a notion that a man is true to his word, that he takes responsibility, that he doesn’t complain, that he isn’t a bully—in fact he defends the vulnerable against bullies. And so even if you are someone who is annoyed by wokeness and political correctness and wants men to be men again and is tired about everyone complaining about the patriarchy, I thought that the model wouldn’t be Richie Rich—the complaining, lying, doesn’t-take-responsibility-for-anything type of figure.”

Two issues that run deeper for Obama than Trump’s personal deficiencies concern the changes he sees in the Republican Party and the broader conservative movement. “I did not believe how easily the Republican establishment, people who had been in Washington for a long time and had professed a belief in certain institutional values and norms, would just cave” to Trumpian populism, he said. He traces the populist shift inside the Republican Party to the election that made him president. It was Sarah Palin, John McCain’s 2008 running mate, he said, who helped unleash the populist wave: “The power of Palin’s rallies compared with McCain’s rallies—just contrast the excitement you would see in the Republican base. I think this hinted at the degree to which appeals around identity politics, around nativism, conspiracies, were gaining traction.” The populist wave was abetted by Fox News and other right-wing media outlets, he said, and encouraged to spread by social-media companies uninterested in exploring their impact on democracy. “I don’t hold the tech companies entirely responsible,” he said, “because this predates social media. It was already there. But social media has turbocharged it. I know most of these folks. I’ve talked to them about it. The degree to which these companies are insisting that they are more like a phone company than they are like The Atlantic, I do not think is tenable. They are making editorial choices, whether they’ve buried them in algorithms or not. The First Amendment doesn’t require private companies to provide a platform for any view that is out there.”

He went on to say, “If we do not have the capacity to distinguish what’s true from what’s false, then by definition the marketplace of ideas doesn’t work. And by definition our democracy doesn’t work. We are entering into an epistemological crisis.” We talked about much more: the Iowa caucus; Ta-Nehisi Coates; climate change; the art and science of presidential memoir-writing; Michelle’s views on race and optimism. It’s all below. The Q-and-A is long but, I think, useful, if only as a reminder of what a thoughtful president sounds like. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and concision. 1. The Cost of Donald Trump’s Petulance Jeffrey Goldberg: How much of the death and destruction we’ve seen—over the past five or six months especially, after the beginning of the pandemic—do you blame on President Trump? Barack Obama: This would have been a really hard thing to deal with for any president, and we’ve seen countries that have acted responsibly and taken the right steps and they’re still seeing an uptick, because we haven’t seen this disease before. This is a really well-designed virus to maximize damage. This is not as deadly as Ebola, it doesn’t transmit as rapidly, but it is just deadly enough that it takes a huge toll. What I think is fair is to take a look at what’s happened in Canada, where they still have had big problems but their death rate per capita is about 61 percent lower than ours. There are a whole set of explanations around that—universal health care in Canada, and in some areas they may not have the same population densities. But it is a comparable country on the same continent.

There is little doubt that if we had had a White House that from the start had said, “Let’s follow the science, let’s take this seriously”—if they had reinforced the message coming from people like [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director] Dr. Fauci and not politicized basic preventive measures like wearing masks, if they had not been intent on rushing the reopening and downplaying the severity of the pandemic across the primary channels that a big chunk of the country gets its news from—some lives could have been saved and we would have had better control of this. It’s also fair to say that had we taken better steps to contact-trace and set up testing protocols earlier, it is likely that we would not have seen severe outbreaks everywhere and we might have been able to reduce the severity of the pandemic in certain portions of the country. The good news is that Joe Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, was my point person on Ebola. He knows how to work on these big public-health issues, and they’ve already surrounded themselves with the right people who are going to be applying the very best science and technology and organizational measures to this problem. The vaccine looks hopeful. It’s going to be a challenge both distributing it and also overcoming some of the mistrust that has developed from misinformation and bad messaging early on. We’ll get through this. But we’re making it harder than it should be. It would have been hard no matter what, but we’ve made it harder.

Read: Joe Biden’s invisible pandemic expert Goldberg: Talk about the transition issues. Obama: For all the differences between myself and George W. Bush, he and his administration could not have been more gracious and intentional about ensuring a smooth handoff. One of the really distressing things about the current situation is the amount of time that is being lost because of Donald Trump’s petulance and the unwillingness of other Republicans to call him on it. 2. Sarah Palin Brings Nativism and Conspiracism to Mainstream Politics Goldberg: Let’s get to the book. What didn’t you know about your presidency until you started writing? Obama: I have to say that when I came to the end of the book and I looked back, my views on my presidency were surprisingly consistent. When I started, I had a basic sense of trajectory of the presidency and the narrative I wanted to write, and during the course of it I didn’t find myself thinking, Huh, I didn’t think of that, or Gosh, upon reflection I feel this. The thing that did surprise me was the degree to which the undertow of resistance to the idea of my presidency dates back to Sarah Palin during the campaign, and emerges through the Tea Party all the way until the end of the book, which ends with the bin Laden raid. Goldberg: This wasn’t clear during your presidency? Obama: During that time, we were so busy and so focused. I also think I very much internalized and believed that presidents can whine privately but not publicly.

Goldberg: Billionaires and presidents. Obama: People are going through much more serious struggles than anything you’re going through. We had all internalized that idea. But when I wrote about the Joe Wilson incident, a congressman yelling “You lie!” in the middle of a joint address to Congress— Goldberg: That was novel. Obama: It had never happened. I remember our general attitude was “On to the next thing.” But as you’re writing, you think, Was that indicative of something that was building and growing? And I’m writing in the middle of the Trump presidency, and I’m seeing that many of the things that had happened in my presidency foreshadowed what would happen during the Trump presidency. Goldberg: In the book it’s very clear that for you Sarah Palin was the first horsewoman of the apocalypse and Rick Santelli, the CNBC reporter who helped spark the Tea Party, was the second horseman. And then the cast grows. Obama: At the time that it’s happening, you get a sense that this is a strain within the Republican Party or the conservative movement that has always been there. It dates back to the Birchers and elements in the Goldwater campaign, but you also sort of feel that all of this is behind us. Goldberg: Your presidency was supposed to be proof in a kind of way that America was moving on. Obama: Right. But what happened is that these things unleash or liberate some of that energy. The power of Palin’s rallies compared with McCain’s rallies—just contrast the excitement you would see in the Republican base. I think this hinted at the degree to which appeals around identity politics, around nativism, conspiracies, were gaining traction. As I was writing, the clarity of those patterns became more obvious.

A corresponding concern as I was writing was the realization that the structural impediments of the U.S. Senate and the filibuster in particular were preventing big things from happening and causing a cynicism to arise, a realization that even after a landslide victory in 2008, or in the midst of a huge crisis, it’s still really hard with big majorities to move a legislative agenda forward. This is something that, by 2011, we had overlearned, from [Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell’s behavior. It was hard to anticipate just how quickly McConnell and the Republican caucus in the Senate would shut things down and the degree to which that kind of obstruction for the sake of obstruction would become the norm. David Frum: The raw desperation of the Republican Party Goldberg: I’m thinking about the moment when you had to demonstrate to [then–Democratic Senator] Max Baucus that [Iowa Republican Senator] Chuck Grassley was just not going to support you on health care, no matter what you conceded to him. Obama: By that time I had already figured it out. Max Baucus hadn’t yet figured it out. This is something I had understood before I started writing the book, but the examples kept coming as I was writing. The combination of Fox News, Rush Limbaugh—the entire right-wing media ecosystem—had changed the Republican base in such a way that Republican elected officials did not feel as if they could afford to cooperate with me or cooperate with Democrats. They couldn’t take anything less than a hard line; they had to tolerate conspiracy theorizing that they knew wasn’t true—obviously that’s pertinent today.

We’re looking at the aftermath of an election now in which Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won pretty decisively. It wasn’t a blowout, but it was as clear a win as I ended up having in 2012. And almost every Republican elected official knows that. There were no howls of voting irregularities the first day or two. They waited to get the signal from Trump. Goldberg: In The Atlantic, Anne Applebaum and others have been writing about the issue of complicity. I’m wondering what you think of people who are smarter than Donald Trump—Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, these sorts of politicians—and their role in all of this. Obama: This is the thing that has surprised me the most over the past four years. Donald Trump’s character and behavior haven’t surprised me. This was all evident before the 2016 election. I didn’t expect him to significantly change. I did not believe how easily the Republican establishment, people who had been in Washington for a long time and had professed a belief in certain institutional values and norms, would just cave. You think about John McCain: For all my differences with him, you would not have seen John McCain excuse a president cozying up to Vladimir Putin, or preferring Russian interpretations of events over those of his own intelligence agencies. And to see figures in the Republican Party do a complete 180 on everything they claimed to believe previously is troubling.

I’ve said this before: The problem facing the Republican Party, the conservative movement, whatever you want to call it, goes back to the attitudes of the base—attitudes that have been shaped by right-wing media. And so essentially what Republican elected officials have done is to say to themselves that in order to survive, we have to go along with conspiracy theorizing, false assertion, fantasies that Donald Trump and Rush Limbaugh and others in that echo chamber have concocted, because people believe them. Goldberg: In the book, you describe what Santelli did on CNBC—his call for a new Boston Tea Party—as “bullshit.” Obama: You can tell if you watch it that it’s shtick. It’s no different than Celebrity Apprentice. It’s entertainment. Except what I noticed watching that clip at the time, and rewatching it as I was writing the book, is that the traders—he’s doing this shtick at the Chicago Board of Trade—the traders believe it. The sense of grievance, the sense that “we”—and define we however you want: white Americans, working-class white Americans, conservatives—“we” are the aggrieved party and that “we” are being victimized, that sense is notable. You have billionaires and CEOs starting to feel like they’re being victimized. And it was interesting to recognize how powerful that impulse was, how readily people would embrace this kind of aggrievement and anger, the resentment that Palin and Santelli were peddling.

So the Tea Party becomes a genuine manifestation of that. It’s rooted in very real frustrations that folks are having about stagnant wages and communities that are deindustrialized. Folks feel like the insiders are taking advantage of them, and there’s a sense of loss of status and identity. It was becoming apparent very early in my presidency that you could take anger and frustration and direct it in what I consider to be a pretty unhealthy direction. 3. Trump Is Richie Rich, not John Wayne Goldberg: Have you explained to yourself the Trump phenomenon in such a way that doesn’t cause you to write off the Americans who voted for him? Obama: I will say that I’m not surprised that somebody like Trump could get traction in our political life. He’s a symptom as much as an accelerant. But if we were going to have a right-wing populist in this country, I would have expected somebody a little more appealing. Goldberg: Not a man-child? Obama: Yes. If you think about populists from the past, someone like Huey Long—he wasn’t from the right; he was a classic populist, rooted in the earth; he knows the lives of the people he is rallying; he genuinely understands them. I guess I would not have expected someone who has complete disdain for ordinary people to be able to get attention and then the following from those very same people. I guess I’m also surprised by, and this is not an original thought on my part—but I think about the classic male hero in American culture when you and I were growing up: the John Waynes, the Gary Coopers, the Jimmy Stewarts, the Clint Eastwoods, for that matter. There was a code. This is something I always emphasize. I may be African American but I’m African and American. This is part of me. The code of masculinity that I grew up with that harkens back to the ’30s and ’40s and before that—there’s a notion that a man is true to his word, that he takes responsibility, that he doesn’t complain, that he isn’t a bully; in fact he defends the vulnerable against bullies. And so even if you are someone who is annoyed by wokeness and political correctness and wants men to be men again and is tired about everyone complaining about the patriarchy, I thought that the model wouldn’t be Richie Rich—the complaining, lying, doesn’t-take-responsibility-for-anything type of figure.

I think that indicates the power of television in the culture that sometimes I miss because I don’t watch a lot of TV. I certainly don’t watch reality shows. And sometimes I’d miss things that were phenomena. But I thought there was a shift there. I write about it to some degree. I actually have great admiration for a lot of those traditions, what were ascribed to be masculine qualities. When you think about the Greatest Generation, you think about sacrifice. Tom Nichols: Donald Trump, the most unmanly president Goldberg: A colleague of mine says that in some ways you’re a never-Trump conservative. Obama: I understand that. There’s this sense of probity, honesty, responsibility, of homespun values, that I admire. That’s the Kansas side of me. My grandmother’s a stand-in for that. The folks we celebrate at Normandy, including my Uncle Charlie, who was a member of one of the units that liberated parts of Buchenwald, those were men who, whatever their limits, whatever their constraints in terms of their emotions because of what they were told they could and couldn’t feel and be as men, however their relationship with women was skewed by all this—they sacrificed for others. And they never bragged, and certainly they would never make cheating others or taking advantage of them a calling card. So I guess the answer to your question is, I’m not surprised there was a market for populism, not just in the United States but around the world. Globalism is—

Goldberg: You’re just surprised by the horse populism rode in on. Obama: Yes, and it’s this indication of parts of popular culture that I’ve missed. It’s interesting—people are writing about the fact that Trump increased his support among Black men [in the 2020 presidential election], and the occasional rapper who supported Trump. I have to remind myself that if you listen to rap music, it’s all about the bling, the women, the money. A lot of rap videos are using the same measures of what it means to be successful as Donald Trump is. Everything is gold-plated. That insinuates itself and seeps into the culture. Michelle and I were talking about the fact that although we grew up in very different places, we were both very much working-class, lower-middle-class, in terms of income, and we weren’t subject day-to-day to the sense that if you don’t have this stuff then you are somehow not worthy. America has always had a caste system—rich and poor, not just racially but economically—but it wasn’t in your face most of the time when I was growing up. Then you start seeing Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, that sense that either you’ve got it or you’re a loser. And Donald Trump epitomizes that cultural movement that is deeply ingrained now in American culture. You mentioned earlier that I’m in some ways a never-Trump conservative. That’s not quite right, but what is true is that temperamentally I am sympathetic to a certain strain of conservatism in the sense that I’m not just a materialist. I’m not an economic determinist. I think it’s important, but I think there are things other than stuff and money and income—the religious critique of modern society, that we’ve lost that sense of community.

Here’s my optimistic view. This gives me some hope that it’s possible to make common cause with a certain strand of evangelical or conservative who essentially wants to restore a sense of meaning and purpose and spirituality … a person who believes in notions like stewardship and caring for the least of these: They share this with those on the left who have those same nonmaterialistic impulses but express themselves through a nonreligious prism. When you look at the younger generation, Malia and Sasha’s generation, you see that more clearly. It’s more often articulated, what they want out of life. They’re much less likely to have a need to be on Wall Street by such-and-such date. That is not how they seem to be defining themselves quite as much. That makes me more optimistic. 4. How Power Actually Works Goldberg: I want to talk a bit about the writing, and writing choices. By the way, I went back and looked at Ulysses S. Grant and he definitely did not use the expression “ethereal bisexual’ in his memoir. I believe you’re the first president to use this expression— Obama: Maybe the last. Goldberg: I’ll let the readers of the book find the reference to an ethereal bisexual for themselves. On writing choices, one of my questions has to do with the tremendous amount of contextualization you do, and specifically the way you contextualize your opponents. This book feels like a hinge between a distant political past and the political present. You generally represent your positions with restraint; you contextualize everything, including the positions of your enemies—you are actually nicer to your enemies than Trump is to his friends. Maybe this is just characterological, or maybe this is a choice to be “presidential” in your writing style? I’m thinking about this scene on your first Inauguration Day when you’re in the car with President Bush, people are jeering him, and you’re feeling sympathy for him.

Obama: There is no doubt that one of the themes of the book is me just wanting to hang on to who I am—my soul, my sense of right and wrong, my character—while operating at the highest level of politics. Goldberg: This is the question of how any president stays human, given the absurd nature of the job. Obama: There is the father, the friend, the husband. The title of the first section is “The Bet”—I’m making a bet first about the nature of America and the power of democracy, a belief that it is possible that a big, diverse, contentious, multiracial, multiethnic country can make its union a little more perfect and set an example for the world. And the second big bet is that I can participate in this process without being hopelessly corrupted. And so some of what you see in the book is me grappling with the inevitable choices and compromises that come up. Goldberg: Starting with your first campaign— Obama: Starting with my first political race, having to decide whether to try to knock someone off the ballot who had gone back on her word to me but at the same time didn’t have the signatures to run. This is a ballot-access issue. Signatures were used to help insiders stay on the inside—how do I feel about that? And this goes all the way to the end of the book, and to the end of my presidency. Part of what you’re sensing here are times when I make decisions to be gracious, when I assume the best in people, not because I’m naive but because this is how I choose to operate in the world, because I think the world would be better if more people operated that way. Sometimes I fall short and am disappointed in myself, but at least I think it’s important to be anchored in ethics and morality and basic human decency in how you behave.

People during my presidency oftentimes had a misunderstanding of what the effect of wielding power is. They thought that bluster and being nasty somehow get more stuff done. And I remember parts of my presidency when my own base would get frustrated, at least among the intelligentsia. They would contrast me with Lyndon Johnson: “Even though he was a son of a bitch he got the Voting Rights Act passed,” and so on. “And that’s how you need to be, Obama, you’re too nice”— Goldberg: Hyde Park law professor— Obama: Yes, what have you. And not publicly, but privately, I would remind people that Lyndon Johnson got stuff done because he had the votes. Simple. FDR got stuff done when he had the votes. And the truth of the matter is that most of the time, what we think of as arm-twisting and brow-beating—what it really comes down to most of the time is: Do you have the votes? When you look at getting the Affordable Care Act passed, not just getting it through the Senate but then working with Nancy Pelosi to get House Democrats to pass a Senate bill that they thought was not progressive enough, I worked my caucus effectively, and not once did I grab someone by the lapels in an elevator or engage in a bunch of dirty tricks to get someone to do something. It turns out that where I fell short in getting everything I wanted, it really comes down to the factors we’ve already discussed—the filibuster in place in the Senate, which meant you had to get 60 votes on everything. That was true in my first month in office. We had a huge and an obvious economic crisis, and we were able to squeak out a few Republican votes to get [the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act] passed. And one of those Republicans, Arlen Specter, was chased out of the party for having voted for an emergency package that we know now Republicans didn’t ideologically oppose, because they just passed a $2 trillion relief package with a Republican as president.

Goldberg: There will be renewed Republican interest in deficits come January 21. Obama: Absolutely. As I was writing the book, there wasn’t a time when I was reflecting back and thought that I was too nice here or there. Goldberg: Should you have been caught trying more? Obama: What do you mean? Goldberg: Meaning, drinking with McConnell more often, working the opposition— Obama: Look, this comes out more in volume two, and I will be more explicit on this, but take [former House Speaker] John Boehner for example. He and I had a perfectly good relationship, but he had to act a certain way for his caucus. He would badmouth many of them to me, in private. Much as John McCain did. The issue was never personal—Mitch McConnell is not buddy-buddy with anyone. I’m enjoying reading now about how Joe Biden and Mitch have been friends for a long time. They’ve known each other for a long time. I have quotes from Biden about his interactions with Mitch McConnell. The issue with Republicans is not that I didn’t court them enough. We would invite them to everything: movie nights, state dinners, Camp David, you name it. The issue was not a lack of schmoozing. The issue was that they found it politically advantageous to demonize me and the Democratic Party. This was amplified by media outlets like Fox News. Their voters believed this, and over time Republicans became so successful in their demonization that it became very difficult for them to compromise, or even be seen being friendly.

Goldberg: Charlie Crist in Florida is an example. Obama: This happens very early. You asked me what surprised me when I wrote the book. I had forgotten how fast everything takes place here. I am sworn in, and within a month we pass the Recovery Act. In two to three months we had bailed out the auto industry; we had fixed the banking system so that it didn’t collapse. And I meet Charlie Crist, at the time a very popular Republican governor known for bipartisanship, and me shaking his hand and giving him a modified bro hug, it destroys him in the party. That was within a month of me being sworn in, at a time when my approval ratings were still around 63, 65 percent. I am, at that point, a very popular president in the midst of his honeymoon, and congratulating somebody, and just being polite and courteous to them. This is a person whose state is hemorrhaging, and he chooses to support an economic-bailout package that will save jobs and homes in his own state. He is immediately vilified and driven out of the party. And that’s the beginning of Marco Rubio’s career, going after Charlie Crist as a RINO, a “Republican in name only.” And John McCain giving a standard platitude, saying, after an election, “I’m praying for President Obama’s success,” this gets an immediate rejoinder from Rush Limbaugh, which echoes through the conservative media-sphere. This notion that this stuff wasn’t baked in, that if I’d just had a few more scotches with Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan, that that would have done it … 5. What’s the Matter With Iowa? Goldberg: It’s obvious from the writing that you have great enthusiasm for Iowa. It’s the state that really launched you, but it’s more than that. It’s a moment in time before we seem to enter a different phase of history, and it’s also, at least to my reading, a chapter about the last unalloyed good time you had in the run-up to the presidency and the presidency itself."

‘HE WON’: President Donald Trump worked to take back an apparent acknowledgment that Joe Biden won the White House and made clear he would keep trying to overturn the election result.

VIRUS TRANSITION: President-elect Biden’s scientific advisers plan to meet with vaccine makers in the coming days even as a stalled presidential transition keeps them out of the loop on government plans to inoculate Americans against COVID-19. Biden chief of staff Ron Klain says Trump’s refusal to accept that he lost the election means that the Biden team lacks a clear picture of the groundwork within the government for a mass vaccination campaign that will last the better part of next year .

WOMEN CRUCIAL TO BIDEN WIN: From nearly the moment Trump took the presidential oath, it was women who were the face of the resistance — marching in enormous numbers in their pussyhats and fueling Democratic gains in the 2018 midterm elections. So in 2020, the year women celebrated the centennial of the 19th Amendment guaranteeing their right to vote, many had expected — and some polls suggested — a dramatic repudiation of Trump with a widened gender gap. The results were a bit more complicated .

MARIJUANA EMBRACED: Recreational marijuana initiatives passed in four states this year : liberal New Jersey, moderate Arizona and conservative Montana and South Dakota. The results prove how broadly accepted marijuana has become throughout the country and across party lines. In South Dakota and Montana, where Trump won handily, recreational marijuana passed with at least 16 percentage points more of the vote than Biden received.

Scientists sound warning about UK PM Johnson's mass-testing 'moonshot',102,jv5ysu,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-moonshot/scientists-sound-warning-about-uk-pm-johnsons-mass-testing-moonshot-idUSKBN27W1C6,14,1605558601.0,,"LONDON (Reuters) - A group of scientists said on Monday that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “Operation Moonshot” plan for mass coronavirus testing, intended to allow large parts of the economy to reopen, was likely to be ineffective and expensive.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is seen at the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test centre at Stanley Park, near Anfield, on the first day of a newly imposed lockdown, in Liverpool, Britain, November 5, 2020. REUTERS/Carl Recine

Slovakia says mass testing has allowed it to reopen theatres, cinemas and churches, and the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus is thought to have originated, tested its whole population in May.

The scientists acknowledged that Britain’s existing “test and trace” scheme, focusing on people with symptoms, had been plagued by difficulties.

But Professor Allyson Pollock, Clinical Professor of Public Health at the University of Newcastle, told reporters the evidence around rapid tests was “poor and weak at the moment”.

“We’re arguing the ‘Moonshot’ programme really should be paused, until the cost-effectiveness and the value for money of any of these programmes is well established,” she said.

Pollock, along with colleagues from universities in Birmingham, Warwick and Bristol, said the rapid tests - which usually produce results within minutes, rather than needing laboratory processing - could give false reassurance that people were not infectious.

She said the priority should be improving the test and trace system, which reached 85% of positive cases between Oct. 29 and Nov. 4, but only managed to ask 60% of their close contacts to self-isolate.

The government last week published an evaluation of an Innova rapid test, saying it had detected around 75% of positive cases, rising to 95% of individuals with high viral loads.

Jon Deeks, Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Birmingham, said analysis of the results showed that it might miss 25-50% of positive cases.

He also said it was not clear that the most infectious people could be identified reliably.

Though the false positive rate was just 0.4%, hundreds of thousands of people still wrongly be told to self-isolate, he said:

“It certainly isn’t a suitable way to make sure we have a safe Christmas, and they could actually do a lot of harm.”"
"SpaceX wants to impose its 'own legal regime' on Mars for human settlements. A space law expert says that's dubious, but Earth should take it seriously anyway.",5,jv06la,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/spacex-wants-to-impose-its-own-legal-regime-on-mars-for-human-settlements-a-space-law-expert-says-that-s-dubious-but-earth-should-take-it-seriously-anyway/ar-BB1aEstR?bep_ref=1&bep_csid=23519,8,1605528289.0,,"© SpaceX/YouTube An illustration of SpaceX's Starship rocket system lifting off from a Mars city and heading back to Earth. SpaceX/YouTube

Elon Musk wants to build a settlement on Mars using Starship, a new fully reusable rocket system that SpaceX is developing to carry 100 people per flight.

SpaceX's general counsel recently said he's drafting ""a constitution for Mars"" and that the company may impose its ""own legal regime"" on the red planet.

SpaceX apparently wants Mars to be ""a free planet"" where ""no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty,"" according to terms of service for Starlink, SpaceX's satellite-based internet service.

However, Frans von der Dunk, a professor of space law, says SpaceX won't get any Martian state recognized without skillful international diplomacy and major changes to space law.

Though it's uncertain SpaceX will ever establish a Mars settlement, von der Dunk said Earth should start discussing how to handle such a future anyway.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

SpaceX may try impose its ""own legal regime"" on Mars and form a ""self-governing,"" self-sustaining settlement where Earth laws wouldn't apply.

Load Error

Though this may sound like a page taken out of a sci-fi novel, Elon Musk's aerospace company has indicated its intentions to do just that in two recent and remarkable posts.

The first is a wide-ranging Law360 interview with SpaceX general counsel David Anderman, who revealed he's drafting a constitution for Mars. The second is the terms of service for Starlink, SpaceX's new satellite-internet project, which Reddit users shared after receiving a public beta test invitation.

But to get Earth to recognize the sovereignty of any would-be Martian state, SpaceX will have to pull off some astounding diplomacy and changes to international law, says Frans von der Dunk, a leading expert of space law at Nebraska College of Law.

""You can come up with many interesting examples where you have people trying to call themselves a state and not being recognized,"" von der Dunk told Business Insider.

Still, he thinks the international community should take SpaceX and its founder Elon Musk seriously — and use the moment to work out potential legal quandaries of such a fantastic human future before they're made real.

""We never know if it's going to work or when it's going to work,"" von der Dunk said of SpaceX's planned Martian settlement. ""But this is certainly a serious company with serious backing and serious engineering behind it.""

'The parties recognize Mars as a free planet'

Musk has for many years shared his dream of populating Mars with more than a million people. Though he wants to create cities complete with bars and pizza joints — and quickly — the tech mogul's ultimate goal is ""enabling human life on Mars,"" ideally to back up our species from some indeterminate future catastrophe.

To that end, SpaceX has expanded its facilities in South Texas to develop and test Starship, a nearly 400-foot-tall steel launch system that's fully reusable. If it works as intended, the cost of flying anything to space could shrink 100- to 1,000-fold. In line with that effort, the company has begun mulling its legal approach to rocketing colonists en masse to the red planet.

""Our goal is to be able to send 1,000 starships with 100 people in them every two years,"" Anderman told Law360, which published its interview on October 14. ""We'll start with 100, then a couple hundred, then 100,000, then a million until we have a truly sustainable colony. It will happen in my lifetime. Faster than you think.""

When asked if US law would govern such a settlement, Anderman revealed he's helping draft ""a constitution for Mars.""

""I think SpaceX will move to impose our own legal regime. I think it will be interesting to see how it plays out with terrestrial governments exerting control,"" he added. ""I do think we are going to have a pretty important role to play in what works and what laws apply.""

About two weeks after that interview ran, several Reddit users posted the terms of service for Starlink. The text contained most of what one would expect from a mundane internet service provider agreement. Yet in a section about which laws would govern use of Starlink, the document stated the following:

""For Services provided on Mars, or in transit to Mars via Starship or other colonization spacecraft, the parties recognize Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities. Accordingly, Disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.""

In effect, SpaceX has signaled its diplomatic intentions to make its Martians rule themselves. However, von der Dunk says the company won't pull that off without extraordinary effort on Earth.

SpaceX did not immediately acknowledge Business Insider's request for comment.

Right now, the US would be responsible for SpaceX's Mars settlement

Mars is an average of 158 million miles away from Earth, making the idea of enforcing laws made on Earth, for Earth there seem potentially laughable (despite the existence of a US Space Force).

Still, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, to which 110 nations are currently party — including spacefaring ones like China, India, Russia, and the US — dictates that people who leave Earth carry their national identities with them.

""If [SpaceX] succeeds in building settlements, [Musk] and the people living there, certainly if they are Americans, will still be falling under the US jurisdiction,"" von der Dunk said. ""Not because it's US territory, but because they are US citizens.""

Additionally, Article 6 and Article 7 of the treaty make clear that a country bears the legal burden of its space activities no matter who launches or performs them. Because SpaceX is an American company operating under American licenses, the US would have to assume liability for SpaceX's hardware and actions.

""Imagine if [SpaceX does] something that other states could claim are violation of international law,"" von der Dunk said. ""They don't need to try and sue SpaceX before a US court in a private capacity; they can directly accost the US government.""

So if anything bad happens at SpaceX's Martian settlement, the company could feel the squeeze back on Earth, to the point of potentially interfering with its settlement plans.

Von der Dunk also says ""there is no clear-and-fast guideline as to when you are state,"" but he noted international law does settle around three objective criteria: established territory, a permanent population, and a functional government.

Any would-be Mars settlement would presumably fulfill the latter two requirements. But von der Dunk says the first is impossible to check off as laws are currently written. (He noted the ""space kingdom"" Asgardia, which announced its purported plans to create a nation-state in open space, is even more subject to this problem.) Specifically, Article 2 of the Outer Space Treaty eschews the idea of owning territory beyond Earth, mainly to prevent nations from claiming land on heavenly bodies simply by landing probes there.

""That's what the Outer Space Treaty clearly prohibits,"" von der Dunk said. ""It never thought about the possibility that you'd create a state entirely in outer space.""

'It is important to keep an eye on these things'

© SpaceX An illustration of SpaceX's Starship spaceship entering the Martian atmosphere and using its heat shield, or thermal protection system, to deflect the superheated plasma. SpaceX

Von der Dunk says Earth's nations could move to change or do away with Article 2, or perhaps craft some legal loophole to permit SpaceX to form a self-governing Martian settlement.

""But I think it would be a very difficult exercise, and it certainly won't happen soon,"" he added. ""And, as you can imagine, if this is more likely either a US territory or a territory of US citizens who then create their own new state, countries like China and Russia may not be very sympathetic to the idea.""

And that leads to what von der Dunk described as a subjective and ""murky"" fourth requirement: International recognition of a new state.

""I think, at the end of the day, it all boils down to whether or not the rest of the world, in particular the major spacefaring nations, would agree to that,"" he said.

Two historical examples of the world struggling to accept a new nation stand out, he added.

First there's Taiwan, which technically fulfills all three of the objective criteria of a state — it has territory, a permanent population, and its own government. But on the world stage, China and others dispute the independence of Taiwan, and it has no seat at the United Nations.

There's also the United States. In 1776, when a young and scrappy coalition of colonies declared their independence from British rule, a number of countries declined to recognize the fledgling and war-torn nation. This changed during and after the American Revolutionary War, which ended in 1783.

So while it's not impossible for SpaceX to form a sovereign Martian state recognized by Earth's nations, von der Dunk said the bar remains high with changing Article 2 and earning international recognition of sovereignty.

""Neither of them are, by their own nature, eternal. So I can't completely exclude that, 50 years from now, we will have a state on Mars,"" he said.

For that reason, and the fact that SpaceX is a corporation, Von der Dunk said it's important to take seriously the company's plans and work to develop sensible regulation — even if it seems unlikely Musk will ever get his cities on the red planet.

""SpaceX is a private company, and they want to make money,"" he said. ""It is important to keep an eye on this and to generate international discussions and to make sure things are going in the right [direction] — that you do not get a settlement on Mars which turns out to be totally reckless and without any regard for what we, on Earth, consider in the overarching interest of humanity.""

Trump hasn't attended a coronavirus task force meeting in five months and is taking no role in combatting the surge in the disease,558,jupoq8,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-hasnt-attended-coronavirus-task-force-meeting-in-5-months-report-2020-11,63,1605490401.0,,"President Donald Trump has not attended a meeting of the coronavirus task force for 5 months, reported The Washington Post Sunday.

With Trump taking no active role in attempting to slow the disease, the number of new cases hit a daily record of 184,000 on Friday.

President-elect Biden has demanded that Trump take action to slow the surge in new cases before leaving office in January.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump hasn't attended a meeting of the White House's coronavirus task force in five months, and has taken no steps to slow a surge in the disease since losing his reelection bid, The Washington Post reported Sunday.

The president has not attended a coronavirus task force meeting in ""at least five months,"" a senior official with knowledge of the meetings told the publication. According to the report, Trump is no longer taking an active role in managing the crisis's response.

The report comes with coronavirus cases again surging again in the US, with the number of new cases hitting a record daily high of 184,521 on Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths are also continuing to increase, with 1,431 new deaths recorded on Friday.

White House spokeswoman Sarah A Matthews pushed back against the report, and told Business Insider: ""The President is regularly briefed about the coronavirus. The relevant information is brought to him on the big decisions, and then he moves forward in the way that's best for our country.""

Trump was once a mainstay at the coronavirus task force's daily briefing, but the daily appearances were abruptly halted after the president suggested injecting disinfectant to ward off the virus in bizarre off the cuff remarks in April.

In recent months the president pledged that no widespread restrictions would be introduced by his administration and has taken an increasingly less active role in federal government measures to fight the crisis.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert on the White House coronavirus task force, in comments at a Chatham House event Friday, warned of a ""challenging and ominous"" situation with winter approaching and the disease continues to spread as people are ""congregating indoors.""

In veiled criticism of Trump, Fauci said that the US had reopened too early after an initial peak of the disease in spring, adding ""when we tried to open the economy and open the country again we did it in a disparate way. We didn't have uniform adherence to the guidelines.""

Throughout the pandemic, Trump has spread false claims and disinformation as he sought to downplay the impact of the disease and ignored or dismissed measures advocated by public health officials, such as wearing masks, to halt the spread of the disease. The disease has surged through the White House, with the president himself hospitalized for three days with the illness in September.

At a press briefing at the White House Rose Garden Friday, Trump hailed the development of a coronavirus vaccine by pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer which is expected to widely available early next year.

Trump has raged about the news of the vaccine being announced days after his defeat to Biden in the presidential election. On Twitter, Trump groundlessly claimed ""the Democrats"" and officials inside his administration had suppressed the vaccine to ensure his defeat.

The president's botched response to the crisis is seen as one of the key reasons behind his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden in November's presidential election.

Biden has pledged to renew the federal government's fight against the disease when he takes office on January 20. In comments on Friday, he demanded Trump do more to combat the crisis.

""The crisis does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now. Urgent action is needed today, now, by the current administration — starting with an acknowledgment of how serious the current situation is,"" said Biden."
Sweden has admitted its coronavirus immunity predictions were wrong as cases soar across the country,333,ju90lc,https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-herd-immunity-second-wave-coronavirus-cases-hospitalisations-surge-2020-11,18,1605415669.0,,"Sweden's chief epidemiologist has acknowledged the country is experiencing a second wave of coronavirus despite predicting that the country's no-lockdown policy would prevent another surge.

The chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, had suggested that case numbers would be ""quite low"" in the autumn compared with other European countries that imposed lockdowns.

The latest figures, however, show Sweden is experiencing higher numbers of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths than its neighbors relative to population size.

""We see community spread in many regions simultaneously right now,"" Tegnell said, according to Reuters.

Sweden's chief epidemiologist has acknowledged the country is experiencing a second surge in coronavirus cases despite previously predicting that the number of infections in the autumn would be ""quite low"" because of the country's no-lockdown policy.

""In the autumn there will be a second wave,"" the chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, told the Financial Times back in May. ""Sweden will have a high level of immunity and the number of cases will probably be quite low.""

The latest figures, however, show Sweden is experiencing higher levels of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths than its neighbors, relative to its population size, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.

Sweden recorded 4,658 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, according to official figures reported by Reuters, with new daily cases having surged in recent weeks.

Hospitalizations have also increased dramatically, with more than 1,000 patients with COVID-19 being treated in hospitals, a 60% increase from last week. The figures were reported by the state broadcaster SVT and cited by The Guardian.

Sweden's per capita death rate from the coronavirus is one of the highest in the world.

Tegnell, who has become known for designing Sweden's anti-lockdown policy, acknowledged this week that the country was seeing significant spread of the virus.

""I don't think the definition is that important, but we see community spread in many regions simultaneously right now,"" Tegnell told a press conference, according to Reuters.

Sweden's public-health agency also acknowledged that the high number of cases seen in the country in the first wave had not protected it in the second.

""We also see that many other countries in Europe that had a big effect during the spring, that had lockdowns and now again have lockdowns also see a big increase now,"" Sara Byfors from the Public Health Agency of Sweden told the Financial Times.

""So it seems to follow this pattern that if you had a lot of cases during the spring you also see a lot of cases now ... We don't know why this is.""

The Swedish government initially refused to adopt strict measures to tackle the coronavirus, relying on voluntary guidance to try to curb the spread of infections.

The latest surge in infections, however, has prompted the country to adopt harsher measures in recent weeks.

The country has moved to ban the sale of alcohol in pubs and bars after 10 p.m., and Tegnell this week told Swedes that the government might be forced to introduce travel restrictions across the country ""right before Christmas,"" according to the BBC."

Thousands of President Trump's most fervent supporters were out in Washington, D.C., on Saturday for a day of rallying that echoed the false assertion that the presidential election was marked by fraud.

One week after Joe Biden's presidential victory brought about spontaneous celebrations in the nation's capital, a crowd that included the group Women for America First, right-wing activists and conspiracy theorists gathered in the city's downtown near the White House.

Members of the Proud Boys, a Western-chauvinistic movement designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, were also seen out on the streets of Washington.

A rally and a march to insist that Trump rightfully won a second term were planned for the day. The events went by several names, including the Million MAGA March, the March for Trump and Stop the Steal DC.

By late Saturday morning, hundreds had assembled in Freedom Plaza near the White House.

The demonstrations unfolded peacefully for most of the day, but counterprotesters clashed with the president's supporters and violence erupted as night fell. Counterprotesters were seen overturning tables of vendors selling Trump merchandise, as well as stealing Trump hats and flags and setting them on fire, according to The Washington Post.

Two officers were injured and at least 20 people were arrested, according to the D.C. Mayor's Office. Of those arrests, four were for firearm violations, two for simple assault, one for an assault on a police officer and two for disorderly conduct, D.C. police told member station WAMU. Seven guns were recovered. It was not immediately clear if the guns belonged to Trump supporters or counterprotesters.

Scattered clashes turned violent around 8 p.m., when Trump supporters armed with batons and counterprotesters collided in a brawl five blocks from the White House, The Post reported, before police broke up the groups. A city fire official said a young man was transported to the hospital for serious injuries after he was stabbed in the back during the fight, according to the newspaper.

Videos from earlier in the day showed attendees waving American flags and Trump 2020 flags. Few could be seen wearing masks, even as the U.S. on Friday announced a new daily record of 184,000 confirmed coronavirus cases.

At one point, the crowd was greeted by Trump himself, who rode past demonstrators in his motorcade shortly after 10 a.m. Trump, who has refused to concede the election to Biden, waved to supporters, who held out signs reading ""Best prez ever"" and ""Stop the steal.""

Trump had teased a possible appearance in a tweet on Friday, saying that it was ""heartwarming"" to see the support and that ""I may even try to stop by and say hello.""

Supporters came from far and wide, with many reportedly documenting their trips to Saturday's events. Luis Huerta told member station WAMU that he and his family had driven without stopping from Midland-Odessa, Texas, for the rallies.

""It's about time our voices were heard and about time we stop giving ground,"" Huerta said while holding a ""Texans for Trump"" sign.

Later in the afternoon, protesters moved to the Supreme Court for a rally, chanting ""Four more years!"" and ""USA!"" Among speakers was the far-right media personality and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

Tammy Summers, who traveled to Washington from Missouri, said she was there to show her support for Trump as he continues to contest the election results.

""We're here to tell President Trump that we totally support him,"" Summers said. ""He should never give up the fight and never give in.""

Summers also questioned findings that concluded that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election.

""First, they were saying there was no evidence of fraud. Now they're saying there's no widespread evidence of fraud. I'm sorry, one incident of fraud against our election system is too many,"" she said.

Election officials — both Democratic and Republican — across the U.S. have thoroughly debunked claims of fraud and malfeasance in the 2020 presidential election.

They were joined on Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security, which in a statement concluded, ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."" The statement, which was put out by agencies within the department responsible for election integrity, called the Nov. 3 election ""the most secure in American history.""

Planned counterprotests also took place in the city.

The group Refuse Fascism DC posted a video of its demonstration starting in Black Lives Matter Plaza.

At the Supreme Court, police separated Trump supporters from a group of anti-fascist and anti-Trump protesters, according to video posted to Twitter. After several hours, counterprotesters eventually moved on from the Supreme Court demonstration.

The arrival of the ""stop the steal"" caravans had earlier raised concerns in the overwhelmingly Democratic city.

A handful of skirmishes broke out Friday as counterprotesters attempted to prevent the removal of signs on fencing around the White House.

On Saturday morning, video posted by local activists showed what appeared to be a small group of rallygoers ripping down anti-racism and anti-police-brutality artwork in Black Lives Matter Plaza. That section of the city was renamed during massive racial justice protests over the summer.

Fears that attendees would bring guns — as was the case during anti-lockdown protests in several states in recent months — were also high.

On Saturday, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine tweeted out a reminder about local gun laws, which prohibit openly carrying a firearm and restrict where permitted conceal-carry weapons are allowed.

""No firearms are allowed around the White House, the National Mall, the Tidal Basin or the US Capitol – permit or no permit,"" Racine tweeted.

Washington, D.C.'s chief of police offered a similar warning.

Ahead of the demonstrations, police in Washington announced road closures and parking restrictions.

"'Breakthrough finding' reveals why Covid-19 kills certain patients, especially men",22,ju6hnp,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/breakthrough-finding-reveals-why-certain-covid-19-patients-die-n1247576,3,1605406842.0,,"Dr. Megan Ranney has learned a lot about Covid-19 since she began treating patients with the disease in the emergency department in February.

But there's one question she still can't answer: What makes some patients so much sicker than others?

Advancing age and underlying medical problems explain only part of the phenomenon, said Ranney, who has seen patients of similar age, background and health status follow wildly different trajectories.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

""Why does one 40-year-old get really sick and another one not even need to be admitted?"" asked Ranney, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University.

In some cases, provocative new research shows, some people — men in particular — succumb because their immune systems are hit by friendly fire. Researchers hope the finding will help them develop targeted therapies for those patients.

In an international study in Science, 10 percent of nearly 1,000 Covid-19 patients who developed life-threatening pneumonia had antibodies that disable key immune system proteins called interferons. These antibodies — known as autoantibodies, because they attack the body itself — weren't found at all in 663 people with mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 infections. Only four of 1,227 healthy patients had the autoantibodies. The study was led by the Covid Human Genetic Effort, which includes 200 research centers in 40 countries.

""This is one of the most important things we've learned about the immune system since the start of the pandemic,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, executive vice president for research at Scripps Research in San Diego, who wasn't involved in the new study. ""This is a breakthrough finding.""

Interferons are like a fire alarm and a sprinkler system all in one.

In a second Science study by the same team, the authors found that an additional 3.5 percent of critically ill patients had mutations in genes that control the interferons involved in fighting viruses. Given that the body has 500 to 600 of those genes, it's possible that researchers will find more mutations, said Qian Zhang, lead author of the second study.

Interferons serve as the body's first line of defense against infection, sounding the alarm and activating an army of virus-fighting genes, said virologist Angela Rasmussen, an associate research scientist at the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.

""Interferons are like a fire alarm and a sprinkler system all in one,"" said Rasmussen, who wasn't involved in the new studies.

Lab studies show that interferons are suppressed in some people with Covid-19, perhaps by the virus itself.

Interferons are particularly important for protecting the body against new viruses, such as the coronavirus, which the body has never encountered, said Zhang, a researcher at Rockefeller University's St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases.

When infected with the novel coronavirus, ""your body should have alarms ringing everywhere,"" Zhang said. ""If you don't get the alarm out, you could have viruses everywhere in large numbers.""

Dr. Megan Ranney, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Brown University, says that even after months of treating emergency room patients with Covid-19 she doesn't know what makes certain patients so much sicker than others. Dr. Megan Ranney

Significantly, patients didn't make autoantibodies in response to the virus. Instead, they appeared to have had them before the pandemic even began, said Paul Bastard, the antibody study's lead author, who is also a researcher at Rockefeller University.

For reasons that researchers don't understand, the autoantibodies never caused a problem until patients were infected with Covid-19, Bastard said. Somehow, the coronavirus, or the immune response it triggered, appears to have set them in motion.

""Before Covid, their condition was silent,"" Bastard said. ""Most of them hadn't gotten sick before.""

Bastard said he now wonders whether autoantibodies against interferon also increase the risk from other viruses, such as influenza. Among patients in his study, ""some of them had gotten flu in the past, and we're looking to see if the autoantibodies could have had an effect on flu.""

Scientists have long known that viruses and the immune system compete in a sort of arms race, with viruses evolving ways to evade the immune system and even suppress its response, said Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Antibodies are usually the heroes of the immune system, defending the body against viruses and other threats. But sometimes, in a phenomenon known as autoimmune disease, the immune system appears confused and creates autoantibodies. This occurs in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, when antibodies attack the joints, and Type 1 diabetes, in which the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

Although doctors don't know the exact causes of autoimmune disease, they've observed that the conditions often occur after viral infections. Autoimmune diseases are more common as people age.

In yet another unexpected finding, 94 percent of patients in the study with the autoantibodies were men. About 12.5 percent of men with life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia had autoantibodies against interferon, compared with 2.6 percent of women.

That was unexpected, given that autoimmune disease is far more common in women, Klein said.

""I've been studying sex differences in viral infections for 22 years, and I don't think anybody who studies autoantibodies thought this would be a risk factor for Covid-19,"" Klein said.

The study might help explain why men are more likely than women to become critically ill with Covid-19 and die, Klein said.

""You see significantly more men dying in their 30s, not just in their 80s,"" she said.

Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, noted that several genes involved in the immune system's response to viruses are on the X chromosome.

Women have two copies of this chromosome — along with two copies of each gene. That gives women a backup in case one copy of a gene becomes defective, Iwasaki said.

Men, however, have only one copy of the X chromosome. So if there is a defect or a harmful gene on the X chromosome, they have no other copy of the gene to correct the problem, Iwasaki said.

Bastard noted that one woman in the study who developed autoantibodies has a rare genetic condition in which she has only one X chromosome.

Women more likely to be 'long-haulers'

Scientists have struggled to explain why men have a higher risk of hospitalization and death from Covid-19. When the disease first appeared in China, experts speculated that men suffered more from the virus because they are much more likely to smoke than Chinese women.

Researchers quickly noticed that men in Spain were also more likely to die of Covid-19, however, even though men and women there smoke at about the same rate, Klein said.

Experts have hypothesized that men might be put at higher risk by being less likely to wear masks in public than women and more likely to delay seeking medical care, Klein said.

But behavioral differences between men and women provide only part of the answer. Scientists say it's possible that the hormone estrogen may somehow protect women, while testosterone may put men at greater risk. Interestingly, recent studies have found that obesity poses a much greater risk to men with Covid-19 than to women, Klein said.

Yet women have their own form of suffering from Covid-19.

Studies show that women are four times more likely to experience long-term Covid-19 symptoms, lasting weeks or months, including fatigue, weakness and a kind of mental confusion known as ""brain fog,"" Klein said.

As women, ""maybe we survive it and are less likely to die, but then we have all these long-term complications,"" she said.

After reading the studies, Klein said she would like to learn whether patients who become severely ill from other viruses, such as influenza, also harbor genes or antibodies that disable interferon.

""There's no evidence for this in flu,"" Klein said. ""But we haven't looked. Through Covid-19, we may have uncovered a very novel mechanism of disease, which we could find is present in a number of diseases.""

To be sure, scientists say the new study solves only part of the mystery of why patient outcomes can vary so greatly.

Researchers say it's possible that some patients are protected by previous exposure to other coronaviruses. Patients who get very sick also may have inhaled higher doses of the virus, such as from repeated exposure to infected co-workers.

Although doctors have looked for links between disease outcomes and blood type, studies have produced conflicting results.

Screening patients for autoantibodies against interferons could help predict which patients are more likely to become very sick, said Bastard, who is also affiliated with the Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris. Testing takes about two days. Hospitals in Paris can now screen patients on request from a doctor, he said.

Although only 10 percent of patients with life-threatening Covid-19 have autoantibodies, ""I think we should give the test to everyone who is admitted,"" Bastard said. Otherwise, ""we wouldn't know who is at risk for a severe form of the disease.""

Bastard said he hopes his findings will lead to new therapies that save lives. He noted that the body manufactures many types of interferons. Giving patients a different type of interferon — one not disabled by their genes or autoantibodies — might help them fight off the virus.

In fact, a pilot study of 98 patients published Thursday in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal found benefits from an inhaled form of interferon. In the industry-funded British study, hospitalized Covid-19 patients randomly assigned to receive interferon beta-1a were more than twice as likely as others to recover enough to resume their regular activities.

Researchers need to confirm the findings in a much larger study, said Dr. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, a researcher at Imperial College London who wasn't involved in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial. Future studies should test patients' blood for genetic mutations and autoantibodies against interferon to see whether they respond differently from others.

Peiffer-Smadja said inhaled interferon may work better than an injected form of the drug because it's delivered directly to the lungs. While injected versions of interferon have been used for years to treat other diseases, the inhaled version is still experimental and not commercially available.

And doctors should be cautious about interferon for now, because a study led by the World Health Organization found no benefit to an injected form of the drug in Covid-19 patients, Peiffer-Smadja said. In fact, there was a trend toward higher mortality rates in patients given interferon, although the finding could have been due to chance. Giving interferon later in the course of disease could encourage a destructive immune overreaction called a cytokine storm, in which the immune system does more damage than the virus.

Around the world, scientists have launched more than 100 clinical trials of interferons, according to clinicaltrials.gov, a database of research studies from the National Institutes of Health.

Until larger studies are completed, doctors say, Bastard's findings are unlikely to change how they treat Covid-19.

Dr. Lewis Kaplan, president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, said he treats patients according to their symptoms, not their risk factors.

""If you are a little sick, you get treated with a little bit of care,"" Kaplan said. ""You are really sick, you get a lot of care. But if a Covid patient comes in with hypertension, diabetes and obesity, we don't say: 'They have risk factors. Let's put them in the ICU.'""

Updated at 4:48 p.m. ET

President Trump's legal challenges to the election met with a series of defeats and setbacks on Friday as judges found the Trump campaign's arguments and evidence that there was widespread fraud and irregularities with the vote to be lacking.

An appeals court in Pennsylvania rejected an objection by Trump's lawyers to practices involving mailed ballots; a Michigan judge threw out claims made by the campaign as ""incorrect and not credible.""

In a case in Arizona, where Democrat Joe Biden holds a slender lead over Trump, the president's lawyers admitted the judge no longer needed to weigh in because ""the tabulation of votes statewide has rendered unnecessary a judicial ruling as to the presidential electors.""

""Trump's legal strategy seems to be aimed at denying the inevitable,"" said Marc Elias, the top Democratic election lawyer, during a call with reporters Friday.

Trump's efforts haven't been defeated in every single case, but even victories don't seem likely to turn the tide. In Pennsylvania on Thursday, a judge ordered that the state could not count ballots that had been set aside because they had been cast under a policy changing the relevant deadline. However, the number of ballots isn't sufficient to change the outcome of the election.

Overall, the legal campaign does not appear to be making headway in its manifold attempts to contest the result in federal court and the courts of key states. It's encountering other headwinds as well, including the withdrawal of law firms that had been engaged to take on the cases.

Trump and advocates have made broad claims about what they call fraud or impropriety in the election — ones rejected by the nation's relevant officials — but attorneys are more sensitive about what they're willing to state before a judge in court, frequently conceding they did not have any evidence.

""When you don't know the facts and you don't have the law and you don't have a remedy, you've really got nothing to go on in court,"" said University of Kentucky law professor Joshua Douglas.

Trump's public relations strategy appeared set to continue. The campaign is soliciting contributions for what it calls its legal defense fund, but which also go toward covering other costs, and Trump suggested on Friday that he might join a rally scheduled for Saturday in Washington.

Vice President Pence, meanwhile, said at an event in Washington that Trump isn't prepared to concede and that the legal challenges would continue.

""As our election contest continues in courts across America, I want to promise you: We are going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted and until every illegal vote is thrown out. And whatever the outcome at the end of the process, I promise you: We will never stop fighting to make America great again,"" he said.

Charles Koch Says His Partisanship Was a Mistake,34,jtk8wv,https://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-koch-says-his-partisanship-was-a-mistake-11605286893,13,1605317949.0,,"Four days before this year’s presidential election, Charles Koch—the voluble Kansas billionaire who has spent a fortune injecting his particular brand of prairie libertarianism into the American political debate—pauses at the other end of the line when asked if he will vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden.

“That’s a very divisive question, because however I answer, that’s going to upset a bunch of people,” he says. “That’s why there’s a secret ballot.”

Mr. Koch, whom Forbes calls the 15th-wealthiest man in the U.S., says he isn’t interested in more division. At age 85, he says, he is turning his attention to building bridges across partisan divides to find answers to sprawling social problems such as poverty, addiction, recidivism, gang violence and homelessness. His critics are skeptical, noting that his fierce Republican partisanship over the years blew up a lot of bridges.

Mr. Koch has written (with Brian Hooks) a new book, “Believe in People: Bottom-Up Solutions for a Top-Down World,” which will be published on Nov. 17. It is part mea culpa, part self-help guide and part road map toward a libertarian America. Along the way, the book traces Mr. Koch’s life from hardheaded adolescent to student, engineer, industrialist, tycoon and political mastermind. The book suggests that he wants to add one final act: philosopher and, he hopes, unifier.

The key to successful, long-term movements? “Unite a diversity of people behind a common goal,” Mr. Koch says. “That’s our approach today.”"

The big picture: Trump has refused to concede to President-elect Joe Biden and is pursuing lawsuits in a number of states with baseless claims of voter fraud. The public statement from the president's own Department of Homeland Security undermines his narrative and is sure to infuriate him.

What they’re saying: “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised,"" members of the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council (GCC) Executive Committee said in a statement.

Voting systems were made secure through pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s certification of equipment.

The joint statement acknowledged “opportunities for misinformation” and urged voters to seek out election officials as “trusted voices.”

Between the lines: This government statement about the election being secure should be unremarkable, Axios' Jonathan Swan notes.

But the sad reality is it’s a dangerous document for the officials who wrote it.

Every person who had a hand in writing it will almost certainly face the wrath of Trump and his inner circle in the White House.

Driving the news: CISA director Christopher Krebs has told associates he expects to be fired after he angered the White House by debunking election misinformation promoted by Trump online, Reuters first reported Thursday."
Senate likely to vote on controversial Fed pick next week,24,jt3osv,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-mitt-romney-lisa-murkowski-85db87d7c7f24f125bcb47b7b31049ca,4,1605245402.0,,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s unorthodox choice for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Judy Shelton, could be approved by the Senate next week, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office said Thursday.

The willingness of the Senate GOP leadership to bring Shelton’s nomination to the floor indicates that they likely have the votes to approve her for the central bank’s board. Her selection stalled in September when Sen. Jon Thune, a member of the Senate leadership, said that she didn’t have sufficient support.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska, said Thursday she would support Shelton, after previously refusing to disclose her position. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney from Utah has said he is opposed to Shelton’s nomination. Republicans currently have a 53-47 majority.

Shelton’s path to Senate approval may have been eased by Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election. When Trump first announced her selection in 2019, many analysts noted that if she became a Fed governor and Trump won reelection, he could nominate her to replace Jerome Powell, the current chair, whose term expires in February 2022. Now that Trump has lost his reelection bid, there is no prospect for Shelton to become chair, which may have made it easier for GOP senators to support her nomination.

Shelton, a conservative economics commentator, has run into stiff opposition from Senate Democrats, most economists, and many former Fed officials for her past support of the gold standard and for writings that questioned the Fed’s political independence . Under the gold standard, the U.S. dollar’s value is tied to gold. Under that approach, the Fed has had less leeway to adjust interest rates, even in a severe recession.

Shelton was approved by the Senate Finance Committee on a 13-12 party-line vote in July . Senate Democrats criticized her for appearing to flip-flop on many positions, including near-zero interest rates. She opposed ultra-low rates during President Barack Obama’s presidency but supported them after President Donald Trump took office and demanded that the Fed lower its short-term benchmark rate.

As a member of the Fed’s powerful board of governors, Shelton would vote on the Fed’s rate decisions and on banking regulation. The governors also vote on whether to institute emergency measures, such as the Fed’s decisions in March to start buying corporate bonds for the first time and institute a raft of programs to bolster financial markets.

Still, on her own, it’s unlikely that Shelton would have much effect on Fed policy, economists have pointed out. The central bank operates by consensus and Fed governors rarely dissent from interest rate decisions, though Fed bank presidents do.

President Donald Trump's refusal to concede could prolong the US coronavirus outbreak and lead to more loss of American lives, senior administration officials have told The Daily Beast.

On Monday, Trump blocked government officials from working with President-elect Joe Biden's staff while continuing to contest the 2020 election results, the Associated Press reported.

That includes Trump's COVID-19 task force, which has been barred from communicating with the team that will handle Biden's response to the pandemic, according to The Daily Beast.

Multiple current senior officials working on Trump's COVID-19 response spoke with The Daily Beast, including those working on Operation Warp Speed, a private-public coordination to speed up the process of developing and distributing a coronavirus vaccine.

These officials told The Daily Beast that without close partnership with Biden's team, there could be significant delays in disbursing a coronavirus vaccine to the public.

""The vaccine distribution planning takes time,"" one senior health official told the outlet. ""And Operation Warp Speed has built up a huge database that is guiding their decisions about how best to roll out the vaccine. It's essential Biden's camp has access to this information so that when a vaccine does become available it can get out to the public quickly.""

Business Insider has contacted the White House for comment.

Public-health experts have been optimistic about Biden's presidency, with some telling Business Insider's Aria Bendix recently that Biden had the potential to create a smoother vaccine rollout and overall decline in coronavirus cases.

Experts told Business Insider that had Trump been reelected, hundreds of thousands of additional lives might have been lost, with schools and businesses likely to have remained open in virus hot spots, and the administration's messaging on masks mixed and politicized.

Biden, meanwhile, has supported masks and social-distancing efforts and could encourage more Americans to adopt these practices, the experts said.

Marissa Levine, a public-health professor at the University of South Florida, said she was particularly hopeful that the Biden administration would go for a federal government-led vaccine-distribution plan, as opposed to the decentralized state-focused effort that the Trump campaign had been working on.

Their invigoration now may add to a fracturing of the information ecosystem.

“There are real dangers around a fractured misinformation system, especially as it relates to organizing against our electoral integrity,” said Shannon McGregor, a professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and senior researcher at the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life.

But Ms. McGregor said she was skeptical that any migration would lead to permanent departures from Facebook and Twitter. “If there is no one to argue with, no omnipresent journalists or media entities to react to, how long will it last?” she said.

Facebook and Twitter declined to comment. The companies have denied censoring conservatives and typically point to their terms of service when an account breaks the rules. And while many conservatives are upset about their content being labeled or hidden, they are less willing to acknowledge that their posts can often clash with Facebook’s guidelines around disinformation and harmful content.

Next week, Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, and Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, are scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing over their sites’ treatment of an unsubstantiated New York Post article that was critical of Hunter Biden, the son of President-elect Joseph R.

Lawyers Litigating for Trump Suddenly Remember Their Licenses Are on the Line If They Lie to a Judge,10,jsb6qe,https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/lawyers-litigating-for-trump-suddenly-remember-their-licenses-are-on-the-line-if-they-lie-to-a-judge/,2,1605140758.0,,"There’s a big difference between a) waving around a stack of affidavits in a safe space and b) bringing your claims before a judge. We saw that difference on Tuesday in the Trump campaign’s case in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly and falsely said from the get-go that he “won Pennsylvania by a lot.” Now that the election has been called for Joe Biden, lawyers for the president’s campaign and the Republican National Committee—some of them supposedly troubled—are in the uphill position of having to explain why they are in court.

RELATED: ‘Profoundly Disturbing’: Nearly 80-Percent of Trump Supporters Believe President’s False Voter Fraud Claims

It was apparent to legal commentators that one of the lawyers arguing the Montgomery County case before Common Pleas Judge Richard P. Haaz was not going to risk losing his law license by lying in court. Some also noted that sanctions may be issued where frivolous lawsuits have been filed.

No one has the “right” to behave like a petulant child and be a sore loser. And no one has the “right” to file frivolous lawsuits. Lawyers are sanctioned for wasting the courts’ time when they do so. There is no evidence of voter fraud, and there never has been. Time to move on. — Daniel Goldman (@danielsgoldman) November 11, 2020

These lawyers need to be sanctioned. Enough is enough. https://t.co/97qypZfYjK — Asha Rangappa (@AshaRangappa_) November 11, 2020

As of right now, Biden is ahead by 46,000 votes in Pennsylvania, but the Trump campaign was in court litigating against the Montgomery County Board of Elections to discuss “approximately 600 ballots.” The actual number of ballots, as you’ll see, is 592. In Montgomery County, Biden is ahead by 130,000 votes.

The Trump campaign claimed that the Montgomery Board of Elections refused to abide legal requirements for canvassing and counting mail-in ballots “for which outer declaration envelope is not completed filled in with the elector’s signature, address and/or date of execution.”

On Tuesday, Judge Haaz promptly put Trump campaign attorney Jonathan S. Goldstein on the spot. The judge asked him point-blank if the campaign was actually alleging any fraud. Goldstein went to bat for President Trump while admitting that he was not alleging fraud, uttering the phrase (twice): “To my knowledge at present, no.” Legal experts said that Goldstein’s remarks were typical of a lawyer unwilling to risk sanctions or bar discipline in service of a client.

Other lawyers, some of them known for their affiliations with Democratic causes and the Biden campaign, noted that Goldstein’s remarks to the judge were in stark contrast to the president’s entirely unsupported “stolen” election narrative.

Today in court, a Pennsylvania judge asked a lawyer for Trump point-blank whether he was alleging fraud.

Here was the exchange in which Goldstein, without proof of fraud, asked that the ballots in question be thrown out for reasons of material technicality. The attorney noted that “accusing people of fraud is a pretty big step,” and it was a step he did not take:

THE COURT: In your petition, which is right before me — and I read it several times — you don’t claim that any electors or the Board of the County were guilty of fraud, correct? That’s correct? MR. GOLDSTEIN: Your Honor, accusing people of fraud is a pretty big step. And it is rare that I call somebody a liar, and I am not calling the Board of the DNC or anybody else involved in this a liar. Everybody is coming to this with good faith. The DNC is coming with good faith. We’re all just trying to get an election done. We think these were a mistake, but we think they are a fatal mistake, and these ballots ought not be counted. THE COURT: I understand. I am asking you a specific question, and I am looking for a specific answer. Are you claiming that there is any fraud in connection with these 592 disputed ballots? MR. GOLDSTEIN: To my knowledge at present, no. THE COURT: Are you claiming that there or improper influence upon the elector to these 592 ballots? MR. GOLDSTEIN: To my knowledge at present. no. THE COURT: Does it make a difference whether a claim of irregularity or technical noncompliance with the election code is made with or without an accompanying claim of fraud or improper influence? MR. GOLDSTEIN: It does not. I mean, to claim the technical defects are immaterial, which is in some sense some of the thrust of what the DNC argued, is really to misperceive what is going on in the election code. The election code is technical. These requirements are all technical. And some of them sit in that code for reasons that are a mystery for all of us. I mean, I sort of recounted for you my view of why the elector signing in his own hand is material. The DNC have their reasons for why they think it is material or immaterial. The fact of the matter is, it is in the code. The code is itself technical. Those technicalities are part and parcel of the law and a violation of the results in a ballot that can’t be counted.

The Trump campaign lawyer also declined to call Democrats and election officials in Pennsylvania liars. He said that everyone was acting “with good faith.”

The judge followed up by questioning Raymond McGarry, an attorney for the Montgomery Board of Elections. The judge noted that the ballots in question have been separated (“segregated”) from ballots that have been counted:

THE COURT: Before you begin, let me just start off with my questions. So there are subsets. There are 592 ballots which have been identified and segregated. You’ve identified, of that, 509 that have the voter’s address preprinted on the outer envelope, to the right of the voter’s declaration. There is a subset: 266 of those people put their addresses on the front of the envelope, not on the back, where probably it was indicated. Does that mean that for the other 243 of the 509 there’s no written address by the elector, there is just the printed address that the County put on the envelope? MR. McGARRY: Your Honor, for that number that you just said, the answer to your question is that in addition to having the printed address, there also is the bar code, Your Honor. And the bar code scans to the SURE system with a specific identification of the voter involved, which would include their address. But in terms of handwriting the address on the outer envelope, you are correct.

In summary, the Trump campaign appeared in court and they neither identified nor alleged any systemic fraud. The case focuses on 592 ballots that have not been counted in a county where the president is behind by 130,000 votes, and in a state where the president is behind by 46,000 votes.

The judge said he would issue a decision “certainly this week” and “probably” by Thursday.

Georgia to re-count presidential election ballots by hand,24,jslqgd,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-georgia-recount-idUSKBN27R2B9,13,1605174858.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Georgia will re-count all paper ballots cast in the Nov. 3 presidential election by hand, the state’s top election official said on Wednesday, a mammoth task that must be completed by Nov. 20.

Democrat Joe Biden secured more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to gain the presidency on Saturday by winning Pennsylvania after four tense days of counting, delayed by a surge in mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic. Adding Georgia would only add to Biden’s margin of victory.

Republican President Donald Trump has refused to concede defeat and has said - without citing evidence - that the voting was marred by fraud.

The vote count in Georgia showed Biden ahead of Trump by just 14,101 votes out of some 5 million across the state. With the margin so small, a recount is needed, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a news conference.

“You actually have to do a full hand-by-hand recount of all because the margin is so close,” Raffensperger said. “We want to start this before the week is up.”

“People will be working lots of overtime over the next coming weeks,” he said.

Officials will work in pairs, sorting stacks of ballots into piles and counting them under the watch of observers from both political parties, Raffensperger said. The piles will include ballots cast in person and by mail, he said.

“That’s how it’s going to be all the way through, and you’re going to tally it all up. It’s a big process,” he said.

The scale of the endeavour is such that if counting takes place round-the-clock, officials will have to count more than 23,000 ballots an hour in the nine days before the deadline for the results to be certified.

A study by the non-partisan group Fair Vote found that out of 31 statewide recounts between 2000 and 2019, the outcome changed in only three of them. More often, the winner won by a tiny bit more. On average, they shifted the outcome by 0.024%, Fair Vote found - a much smaller margin than Trump would need. Biden currently leads Trump in Georgia by 49.5% to 49.2%.

Georgia’s two U.S. senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans, on Monday called on Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, to resign over his management of the election. They presented no evidence of fraud, however."
"Donations under $8K to Trump ‘election defense’ instead go to president, RNC",616,jsjytd,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-fundraising-insigh/donations-under-8k-to-trump-election-defense-instead-go-to-president-rnc-idUSKBN27R309,93,1605168727.0,,"(Reuters) - As President Donald Trump seeks to discredit last week’s election with baseless claims of voter fraud, his team has bombarded his supporters with requests for money to help pay for legal challenges to the results: “The Left will try to STEAL this election!” reads one text.

But any small-dollar donations from Trump’s grassroots donors won’t be going to legal expenses at all, according to a Reuters review of the legal language in the solicitations.

A donor would have to give more than $8,000 before any money goes to the “recount account” established to finance election challenges, including recounts and lawsuits over alleged improprieties, the fundraising disclosures show.

The emailed solicitations send supporters to an “Official Election Defense Fund” website that asks them to sign up for recurring donations to “protect the results and keep fighting even after Election Day.”

The fine print makes clear most of the money will go to other priorities.

A large portion of the money goes to “Save America,” a Trump leadership PAC, or political action committee, set up on Monday, and the Republican National Committee (RNC). Under Federal Election Commission rules, both groups have broad leeway in how they can use the funds.

The Trump campaign, the RNC and Trump’s new Save America PAC did not respond to requests for comment.

Leadership PACs such as Save America are often set up by prominent political figures to spend money on other candidates, while also paying for personal expenses, such as travel and hotel stays.

The disclosures would allow Trump and the RNC to channel the donations into other political causes or campaigns, such as the two high-stakes January Senate runoff races in Georgia that could determine control of the Senate and are likely to rank among the most expensive races in U.S. history.

Trump’s solicitation website carries a banner headline that says “OFFICIAL ELECTION DEFENSE FUND” and “CONTRIBUTE NOW.”

Scrolling down the page would take a donor to the fine print, which shows that donations are split between “Save America,” which gets 60% of the money, and the RNC, which gets the other 40%. None of the money flows to Trump’s official “recount” committee fund until Trump’s Save America share reaches the legal contribution limit of $5,000, according to the disclosures.

That means that, before a dollar goes into the recount fund, Save America would receive $5,000 and the RNC around $3,300. Donations to the recount committee are legally limited to $2,800.

If a Trump donor gave $500, for instance, $300 would go to Trump’s Save America PAC, $200 would to the RNC - and nothing would go to his election defense fund.

One Republican political strategist said Trump is misleading supporters who might give small donations to whatever cause he approves.

“It’s important to be up front with people - especially those who are digging deep into their pockets to come up with $25,” said Michael DuHaime, a former political director at the RNC. “If you tell them it’s going for legal fees, well then it should go for legal fees.”

Darrell Scott, an Ohio pastor who helped found the National Diversity Coalition for Trump and served on the president’s 2016 transition team, says he sees no problems with diverting the money to the leadership PAC or the RNC.

“I see this as two pockets on the same pair of pants. It doesn’t matter if it goes into the left or the right pocket,” Scott said. “In the end, the money will be used for a legitimate purpose that his supporters will get behind.”

FLURRY OF LAWSUITS

The fundraising pitches have channeled Trump’s rage and his refusal to accept the results of an election that major media outlets called on Saturday for his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, the former Vice President. Most of the Republican Party has fallen in line with Trump’s rhetoric, either by staying silent or publicly supporting the election challenges.

Trump’s campaign has filed a flurry of lawsuits to overturn the results in key states without producing evidence to back his charges of illegal voting. Trump’s lawsuits have instead generally alleged violations of process, such as a lack of access for Republican observers. Legal experts said none of the cases were broad enough to invalidate the number of votes required to overturn Biden’s presumed victory.

Judges have quickly dismissed many of the lawsuits. State election officials, including Republicans, have said there was no widespread fraud. Just a handful of Republican senators have recognized Biden’s win. Many more have not but some Republicans have suggested their patience with Trump’s legal fight may run out soon.

As the president fights what Democrats have called his inevitable ouster from the White House, his fundraising campaign seeks to replenish campaign coffers that were depleted during the presidential race, according to Federal Election Commission data.

Trump’s re-election team kicked off 2020 with an impressive cash advantage, thanks to a massive fundraising operation, including joint efforts with the Republican Party. But the advantage evaporated as Trump’s campaign burned through $1.4 billion of the $1.6 billion raised over the past two years.

By mid-October, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party reelection team were left with $223.5 million and had to scale back advertising. The Trump campaign itself only had $43 million entering the final three weeks of the presidential election, while Biden and the Democrats had $432 million in cash for the final stretch, including $177.3 million in Biden’s campaign.

‘LAVISH LIFESTYLES’

Trump’s post-election fundraising emails - sometimes issued hourly over the last several days - used names such as the Election Defense Task Force and the Official Election Defense Fund. Initially, the disclosures said that Trump would steer a large part of the contributions to pay down campaign debt.

But the disclosure language changed after Trump’s campaign treasurer, Bradley Crate, incorporated the Save America political action committee on Monday. Crate did not reply to requests for comment.

Unlike campaign funds, which have tight controls on how they can be spent, leadership PACs such as Save America carry few restrictions. Republicans and Democrats alike have drawn criticism for using them to pay family members and to fund luxury events in exotic locations. A 2018 report by the Campaign Legal Center and Issue One, two groups that advocate campaign finance reform, said some leadership PACs have been used as vehicles to “subsidize lavish lifestyles” of politicians “on their donors’ dimes.”

Larry Noble, former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, said Trump could use the committee to finance a post-election political career. He said the pitch is misleading for donors who don’t read the fine print.

“He’s really making a big deal about the challenge to the election, and that may very well be why a lot of people may give without paying attention to, or understanding, what the political language is,” Noble said. “It’s pretty dangerous to our democracy to use attacking our elections as a fundraising tool.”

The North Carolina Republican Party has launched a similar strategy, using the election challenges as a way to raise money for other purposes. In several mass emails to potential donors this week, the party says - alongside images of Trump - that it is seeking money to help protect the integrity of the elections.

The legal disclosures, however, show the money is going to an account to pay for the party’s overhead costs and not directly to any challenges of this presidential election. Trump is expected to win North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes.

“They should be more transparent,” said one prominent North Carolina Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity. “If they are soliciting money to help with a legal challenge, and instead the money is going to pay the salary of the political director, that doesn’t seem right.”

Tim Wigginton, a spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, said in a statement that the party wants to “ensure every legal ballot is counted” but did not address questions about whether the fundraising appeals are misleading or why the donations are not being directed to legal defense."

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas became America’s first state Wednesday with more than 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, as sporting events were canceled and the border city of El Paso added mobile morgues in anticipation of virus deaths overwhelming hospitals for weeks.

Texas leaders gave no indication of forthcoming restrictions as the state passed the grim milestone and recorded more than 10,800 new cases on Tuesday, which set a new daily record and is the highest since July. The virus that is surging throughout the U.S. has been unsparing across Texas: The top county official in Fort Worth is pushing to halt youth and school sports, and medical tents were set up outside hospitals for the first time in the rural Panhandle.

“We were certainly hoping we would be in a bubble and not have to go through the things that larger communities were having to deal with because we were in — quote — rural Texas,” said Cory Edmondson, president and CEO of Peterson Health in Kerrville.

“But that quickly came to a halt, and we realized we’re not immune to this,” said Edmondson, whose hospital in the Texas Hill Country now often has more than 10 COVID-19 patients admitted, double the usual number.

State health officials Wednesday reported 6,779 patients in hospitals, a spike of 609 in one day — one of the highest one-day bumps since the state started keep track.

Texas has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases and more than 19,300 confirmed deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Only Illinois has averaged more new cases than Texas over the past two weeks.

Texas recently surpassed California , the most populous state, in recording the highest number of positive coronavirus tests. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.

A spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he was relying on “data-driven hospitalization metrics” and that the state was working to help areas with rising caseloads. Abbott has not held a press briefing about the virus since September, when he announced that he was lifting more restrictions on restaurants and gyms.

“The reality is, COVID-19 still exists in Texas and across the globe, and Texans should continue to take this virus seriously and do their part by social distancing, washing their hands, and wearing a mask,” Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze said.

In El Paso, where more than 1,000 virus patients are hospitalized, local officials have shut down tattoo parlors, hair and nail salons and gyms — all steps that are beyond what Abbott has allowed. The state is fighting the move that Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says is “oppressing” the border county of about 840,000 people, but local officials won a brief reprieve Wednesday when the Texas Supreme Court refused to make an expedited ruling.

El Paso County officials this week announced plans to add four additional morgue trailers, bringing the total number there to 10.

Disruptions to college football programs in Texas are also mounting, with more games postponed or canceled. The latest came Tuesday when No. 5 Texas A&M had its game this week against Tennessee rescheduled for Dec. 12 after Texas A&M reported at least three players or staff members tested positive. The University of Texas-El Paso also announced that it would move a Nov. 20 home game against Alabama-Birmingham to Midland — more than 300 miles (480 kilometers) away — because of the surging number of cases along the border.

New cases around Dallas climbed above 1,200 for a third consecutive day, prompting the county’s top elected official to urge more residents to work from home.

“We are staring down the barrel of the largest spike we have seen to date in COVID cases,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said.

In rural Kerrville, Edmondson said his 124-bed hospital has been able to manage the uptick in cases but worried that numbers could worsen. He described a fatigue within the nine counties his hospital serves with the virus and restrictions.

In Lubbock County, home of Texas Tech University, health officials reported a surge of nearly 3,400 new cases last week. That is nearly 80% of the number of cases reported over the same span in Harris County, which has a population 16 times larger, and hospital tents were being set up in the area, alarming local officials .

“’We know how to do this. Please. I can absolutely assure you that never in my career did I think we would be deploying field hospitals to Lubbock, Texas,” Lubbock City Manager Jarrett Atkinson told television station KCBD."

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s pro-democracy lawmakers announced Wednesday they would resign en masse after four of them were ousted from the semiautonomous Chinese territory’s Legislature in a move one legislator said could sound the “death knell” for democracy there.

The resignation of the 15 remaining pro-democracy lawmakers will ratchet up tensions over the future of Hong Kong , a former British colony that has long been a regional financial hub and bastion of Western-style civil liberties but over which China’s government has increasingly tightened its control. A new national security law imposed by Beijing this year has alarmed the international community.

The mass departure will also leave Hong Kong’s Legislature with only pro-Beijing lawmakers, who already made up a majority but can now pass bills favored by Beijing without much opposition.

The lawmakers told a news conference they would submit their letters of resignation on Thursday. The announcement came hours after the Hong Kong government said it was disqualifying the four legislators — Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung.

The ousters came after China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed a resolution this week saying that any lawmaker who supports Hong Kong’s independence, refuses to acknowledge China’s sovereignty over the city, threatens national security, or asks external forces to interfere in the city’s affairs should be disqualified.

“Today we will resign from our positions because our partners, our colleagues have been disqualified by the central government’s ruthless move,” Wu Chi-wai, the leader of the pro-democracy camp, told reporters.

During the news conference, the lawmakers held hands and chanted, “Hong Kong add oil! Together we stand!” The phrase “add oil” is a direct translation of a Chinese expression of encouragement.

“This is an actual act by Beijing ... to sound the death knell of Hong Kong’s democracy fight because they would think that, from now on, anyone they found to be politically incorrect or unpatriotic or are simply not likable to look at, they could just oust you using any means,” lawmaker Claudia Mo told reporters.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam defended their removal, saying legislators must act properly and that the city needs a body comprised of patriots.

“We cannot allow members of the Legislative Council who have been judged in accordance with the law to be unable to fulfill the requirements and prerequisites for serving on the Legislative Council to continue to operate in the Legislative Council,” Lam said.

Still, Lam said that the Legislature would not become a rubber-stamp body, and that diverse opinion is welcome.

“In terms of legality and constitutionality, obviously, from our point of view, this is clearly in breach of the Basic Law and our rights to participate in public affairs, and a failure to observe due process,” Kwok, one of the ousted lawmakers, told reporters, referring to Hong Kong’s mini-constitution.

In recent months, Beijing has increasingly clamped down on Hong Kong, which was handed back from British colonial rule in 1997, despite promising at the time to leave the territory’s more open legal and economic systems intact for 50 years until 2047.

Beijing imposed a national security law in June that some have labeled draconian after anti-government protests rocked the city for months last year, and it has used it to crackdown on opposition voices.

In response, the U.S. leveled sanctions on several officials, including Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing leader, several Western countries have suspended their extradition treaties with the territory, and Australia and Britain offered Hong Kongers easier paths to settle in those countries.

In Washington, President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, denounced China’s ouster of the lawmakers.

“Beijing’s recent actions disqualifying pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong’s Legislative Council leave no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has flagrantly violated its international commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and its promises to the people of Hong Kong, including those under the Basic Law,” O’Brien said “ ‘One Country, Two Systems’ is now merely a fig leaf covering for the CCP’s expanding one party dictatorship in Hong Kong.”

Australia said the disqualification of the four lawmakers “seriously undermined” Hong Kong’s democratic processes and institutions.

“Australia calls on authorities to allow the Legislative Council to fulfil its role as the primary forum for popular political expression in Hong Kong, and to remain a key pillar of the rule of law and the “One Country, Two Systems” framework,” Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.

Britain also said the decision raised further concerns. “This campaign to harass, stifle and disqualify democratic opposition tarnishes China’s international reputation and undermines Hong Kong’s long-term stability,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.

Beijing has rejected the criticism and lashed out at what it calls gross foreign interference in Chinese politics.

Earlier in the year, the four lawmakers were barred from seeking reelection in a vote originally scheduled for September — but remained in their posts. They were disqualified over their calls for foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and Beijing.

The government eventually postponed the planned September election by a year, citing the coronavirus, but the pro-democracy camp criticized the move as an attempt to block them from taking a majority of seats in the Legislature — which was a possibility in the coming election.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that the disqualification was necessary to maintain rule of law and constitutional order in Hong Kong.

“We firmly support the (Hong Kong) government in performing its duties in accordance with the Standing Committee’s decision,” Wang said at a regular news conference Wednesday.

GOP lets Trump fight election for weeks despite Biden's win,21,jrw79z,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-virus-outbreak-al-gore-elections-a1cc735c11c5750da508b640e4d62b61,7,1605079386.0,,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday there’s “no reason for alarm” as President Donald Trump, backed by Republicans in Congress, mounts unfounded legal challenges to President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory — a process that could now push into December.

Republicans on Capitol Hill signaled they are willing to let Trump spin out his election lawsuits and unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud for the next several weeks, until the states certify the elections by early December and the Electoral College meets Dec. 14.

McConnell’s comments show how hard Republicans are trying to portray Trump’s refusal to accept the election results as an ordinary part of the process, even as it’s nothing short of extraordinary. There is no widespread evidence of election fraud ; state officials say the elections ran smoothly. The delay has the potential to upend civic norms, impede Biden’s transition to the White House and sow doubt in the nation’s civic and election systems.

Trump remained out of sight at the White House, tweeting his views, but the social media company Twitter swiftly flagged the president’s tweets that he actually won the election as disputed.

“It’s not unusual, should not be alarming,” McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill. “At some point here we’ll find out, finally, who was certified in each of these states, and the Electoral College will determine the winner. ... No reason for alarm.”

Democrats were livid, saying McConnell and Republicans in Congress are so afraid of Trump they are willing to risk the nation’s tradition of an orderly transition.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the president is “undermining faith in our elections.”

Biden, taking questions from reporters in Delaware, called the president’s refusal to concede an “embarrassment.”

“How can I say this tactfully?” Biden said. “I think it will not help the president’s legacy.”

Biden said he understands Trump voters’ “sense of loss.” But he said, “They understand we have to come together. ... We can pull the country out of this bitter politics.”

Trump’s GOP allies in Congress have largely declined to congratulate Biden, even though privately many Republicans doubt Trump has any legitimate path to change the outcome.

Republicans are increasingly pointing to a December deadline for Trump to exhaust his legal challenges. That’s when the states face a deadline to certify results and the Electoral College is set to cast its votes Dec. 14. It’s also about the time it took to resolve the 2000 election dispute between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.

Yet, unlike the Bush-Gore election, which was held up over hundreds of contested ballots in one state, Florida, Trump’s team is challenging the outcome in several states with tens of thousands of ballots. Trump would need to produce ample evidence of impropriety to undo Biden’s lead, which appears unlikely.

During a closed-door lunch, Vice President Mike Pence told Senate Republicans about the legal strategy. Sen John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the conversation lasted about five minutes.

McConnell insisted later, “I don’t think we’re going to have an uninterrupted transition.”

Trump’s refusal to concede has led the General Services Administration to hold off on formally beginning the Biden transition, which could hamper the new administration.

Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing ahead in preparation for the Biden administration, particularly the president-elect’s immediate rollout of a sweeping COVID-19 plan.

On Tuesday, Schumer invited Biden adviser Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general, to a private briefing with senators to discuss Biden’s plan to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

Democratic senators said it was like a cloud lifting as they heard plans for a comprehensive approach for bringing the COVID-19 crisis under control.

“Congress should pursue a strong, comprehensive COVID relief bill,” Schumer said. He warned McConnell and Republicans not to block or settle for a more modest effort. “We cannot pretend this pandemic is nearly over,” he said.

Trump and his GOP allies haven’t offered evidence of election fraud, and their legal challenges have largely been rejected by the courts.

Still, Republicans are unwilling to stray from Trump, even in defeat, afraid of angering his most ardent supporters ahead of the Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia that will determine majority control of the Senate . Two Republican senators are struggling to keep their seats against Democratic challengers.

McConnell noted the potential turmoil during the transition in praising ousted Defense Secretary Mark Esper, whom Trump fired on Monday.

McConnell said he expects to speak “soon” with new acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller about threats from terrorists or foreign adversaries ”who may seek to exploit a period of uncertainty.”

He said the times call for “continued sober and steady leadership” at the Pentagon.

Both McConnell and Schumer were reelected as party leaders during private Senate elections Tuesday, but it’s unclear whether McConnell will retain his role as majority leader or cede it to Schumer as the final races for the U.S. Senate play out.

Last week’s elections left the chamber split, 48-48, heading into the new Congress next year. Republicans brushed back Democratic challengers in several states, but failed to lock down the seats needed to retain their majority.

The races for the two seats in Georgia heading to a Jan. 5 runoff are swiftly becoming a showdown over control of the chamber. The state is closely divided, with Democrats making gains on Republicans, fueled by a surge of new voters. But no Democrat has been elected senator in some 20 years.

Two other seats remain too early to call in North Carolina and Alaska. Even if Republicans secure those final two races where ballots are still being counted, they would still fall short of the 51 seats needed.

The vice president of the party holding the White House casts the tie-breaking vote in the Senate. Next year that would be Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. That means 50 seats for Democrats would result in chamber control. But Republicans would need 51 seats to retain power.

The stakes are high for all sides in Georgia, with strategists expecting an eye-popping $500 million could be spent in the weeks ahead."
Pompeo promises ‘smooth transition to second Trump administration’ as world leaders congratulate Biden,44,jrvi8e,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/pompeo-smooth-transition-second-trump-administration-435754,4,1605077151.0,,"When pressed on whether he and his department are preparing to hand over power to President-elect Biden and his team, Pompeo, who at times grew irritated at the questions, made it clear he didn’t see the contest as having concluded. At one point, he referred to the importance of counting “every legal vote” — phrasing other Trump allies have used to suggest without evidence that widespread voter fraud helped Biden.

“When the process is complete, there will be electors selected,” he said. “There’s a process. The Constitution lays it out pretty clearly.”

Pompeo is one of Trump’s most loyal confidants, and he rarely breaks with the president in public. Still, his unwillingness to accept the election results is just more evidence that Trump will not easily quit power. It also sends a signal to the rest of the world of potentially perilous days ahead in America.

The secretary of State’s comments follow a decision by Attorney General William Barr to loosen restrictions on federal prosecutors investigating voter fraud, which Trump claims was rampant. Trump himself, meanwhile, has used Twitter and other means to insist that he won the Nov. 3 election. (In a tweet late Tuesday, he praised Pompeo’s reference to a second Trump administration by noting the secretary was tops in his class at West Point.) Some top Republicans have said Trump should have his chance to fight the results in court, while many others have stayed silent and not congratulated Biden.

At the same time, the head of the U.S. General Services Administration has held off on making the necessary declaration that would allow U.S. executive branch bodies to start interfacing with members of Biden’s transition team. Trump political appointees at various agencies and departments, meanwhile, have told colleagues to proceed with their work as if nothing is changing.

That includes the State Department. Although there is a transition-focused team set up and led by career employees, there’s little it can do until the GSA administrator makes a declaration. State Department employees, meanwhile, told POLITICO there had been little acknowledgement by political appointees on staff calls or other forums that change is afoot.

“That’s their model of dealing with things — if you don’t acknowledge it, it didn’t happen,” one State Department official said of the political appointees.

State Department bureaus have been collecting congratulatory statements from other governments and sending them up the chain, but it’s unlikely those statements have been passed along to the Biden team because of the lack of a GSA declaration.

“My understanding is they are collecting and holding info at this point,” a second State Department official said.

World leaders, meanwhile, have been getting in touch with Biden. The president-elect has spoken to the leaders of Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Germany, though the exact order wasn’t clear.

When asked whether the State Department had taken up its traditional duty of helping arrange such calls during the transition, a Biden aide noted, “We are not able to contact the State Department without GSA ascertainment.”

Biden, a former vice president, said on Tuesday that he had received a welcome reception from the world leaders who have been in touch. When asked whether he would pursue legal action to force the transition to officially begin, Biden said it would be unnecessary, regardless of claims by the president and Pompeo.

“Secretary of State Pompeo,“ Biden said, laughing and not commenting on him further.

The Biden transition team on Tuesday released the names of the people on its “ agency review teams .” The teams are dispatched during transition to various agencies and departments to assess the situations there ahead of the transfer of power.

Pompeo, meanwhile, is expected to travel to several countries in the coming days, and the encounters could get awkward if he’s unwilling to acknowledge he may be out of a job by Jan. 20.

According to documents seen by POLITICO, the secretary plans to visit France, Turkey, Georgia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia between Nov. 13 and Nov. 22.

Pompeo has been holding general news conferences roughly every two weeks over the past several months. He seemed upset that reporters on Tuesday kept asking him about the election, noting that he wanted to talk about foreign policy. But he also at times tried to strike an assuring tone.

“The world should have every confidence that the transition necessary to make sure that the State Department is functional today, successful today and successful with the president who’s in office on January 20th, a minute after noon, will also be successful,” he said.

Asked whether he believed the allegations by Trump and others of voter fraud, Pompeo said: “I’m very confident that we will count — and we must count — every legal vote. We must make sure that any vote that wasn’t lawful ought not be counted. That dilutes your vote if it’s done improperly. We got to get that right. And when we get it right, we’ll get it right.”

One reporter pointed out that Pompeo had routinely issued statements counseling other countries on the importance of free and fair elections, and urging those who lost the elections to concede.

“Doesn’t President Trump’s refusal to concede discredit those efforts?” the reporter asked.

“That’s ridiculous,” Pompeo shot back in a flash of anger. “And you know it’s ridiculous. And you asked it because it’s ridiculous.”

“We want every one of those votes [overseas] to be counted in the same way that we have every expectation that every vote here in the United States will be counted, too,” he said. “It is totally appropriate. The United States has an election system that is laid out deeply in our Constitution, and we’re going to make sure that we get that right.”

In an evening appearance on Fox News, Pompeo expanded on his earlier remarks without directly referring to a second Trump administration.

“We‘ll have a smooth transition and we'll see what the people ultimately decided when all the votes have been cast,” he told the network’s Bret Baier. “We have a process, Bret. The Constitution lays out how electors vote. It‘s a very detailed process laid out. We need to comply with all of that, and then I am very confident that we will have a good transition. That we will make sure whoever is in office on noon on January 20 has all the tools readily available so that we don‘t skip a beat with the capacity to keep Americans safe. That‘s what I was speaking to.“

Poll: 70 percent of Republicans don't believe election was free and fair,95,jrvhbh,https://thehill.com/homenews/news/525388-poll-70-percent-of-republicans-dont-believe-election-was-free-and-fair,50,1605077069.0,,"Seventy percent of Republicans say they don't think that President-elect Joe Biden Joe BidenHouse Democrat touts resolution to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress Science denialism in the new administration Jill Biden to offer input on helping reunite separated immigrant families: report MORE won a “free and fair” election, according to a new Politico/Morning Consult poll.

The response marks a stark increase from the 35 percent of GOP voters who said they felt the election would not be fair before Election Day last Tuesday.

Ninety-six percent of Democrats surveyed said they had trust in the election process and thought it was free and fair, up considerably from the 52 percent of party voters who said they thought it would be before the election.

An overwhelming majority of respondents overall, 69 percent, said they thought the country was going in the wrong direction despite the election results.

Republican respondents expressed specific worries and concerns about election integrity in contested battleground states like Pennsylvania, which was still counting votes Tuesday.

Sixty-two percent of Republicans said the Pennsylvania results would be unreliable, contrasting with 8 percent of Democrats who held the same beliefs.

Distrust is similarly high about Wisconsin (55 percent), Nevada (54 percent), Georgia (54 percent) and Arizona (52 percent), with suspicion being amplified by the Trump campaign, which has filed more than a dozen lawsuits in contested battleground states.

Still, most Republicans are skeptical any disputes will change the reality of President-elect Joe Biden's eventual transition to the White House, as 38 percent of those surveyed said they believe the results will be overturned and 45 percent say that is unlikely.

Most respondents labeled economic decisions, national security defenses, and health care issues as their top priority considered when voting for a president.

A majority of responders disapproved of Trump's job as president during his first term, with 58 percent saying they disapproved and 40 percent approving of his job in office.

Forty-nine percent of respondents in the survey said they leaned Democratically. In contrast, 40 percent said they were Republican-leaning.

U.S. Republicans hint at limited time for Trump to make his post-election case,41,jruprt,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-congress-republicans/u-s-republicans-hint-at-limited-time-for-trump-to-make-his-post-election-case-idUSKBN27Q350,6,1605074628.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Republicans in the U.S. Congress for now are supporting President Donald Trump’s attempt to challenge President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, but some senior aides said Trump must soon produce significant evidence or exit the stage.

Slideshow ( 3 images )

A handful of Republican senators have said they recognize Biden as last week’s winner. Many more have not but are suggesting limits to their patience in giving Trump the benefit of the doubt.

Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a state that Trump won handily last week, said in a statement that Biden is leading in enough states to win election “and President Donald Trump’s campaign must produce evidence to support allegations of election fraud.”

Portman added that he hoped states and courts would move “expeditiously” to resolve the matter.

Behind the scenes, some were more explicit.

“I think the goal here is to give the president and his campaign team some space to demonstrate there is real evidence to support any claims of voter fraud. If there is, then they will be litigated quickly. If not, we’ll all move on,” said one senior Senate Republican aide.

A second such aide, while noting that most Republican senators support Trump’s right to refuse to concede, added that failing any surprise revelations, “At some point this has to give. And I give it a week or two.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Congress’s top Republican, delivered a stinging speech that sounded more like a continuation of 2020 campaign rhetoric than a post-election call for getting down to business.

While defending Trump’s challenge of the election result, McConnell took time to chastise “far-left mobs” that engaged in “summertime rioting” following the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

McConnell also hinted at something far less than prolonged litigation, such as was seen in the 2000 contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore: “Suffice to say a few legal inquiries from the president do not exactly spell the end of the Republic.”

Meanwhile, Republican Senator Marco Rubio late on Monday refused to recognize Biden as the president-elect yet.

But responding to reporters’ questions about unsubstantiated fraud allegations in hotly contested states such as Pennsylvania, Rubio said he was in no position to know what was going on anywhere outside his home state of Florida.

Another matter was higher in some senators’ minds -- a pair of runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of the Senate next year or must turn it over to Democrats.

Asked about the battle Trump is waging against Biden, Republican Senator Mike Rounds said, “No. 1, we have to focus on Georgia and how critical that is as a backstop right now for limiting the amount of major changes that a number of our Democratic colleagues have suggested.”"
Biden not getting intel reports because Trump officials deny he won,879,jrts8z,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/biden-not-getting-intelligence-reports-because-trump-officials-won-t-n1247294,298,1605071706.0,,"WASHINGTON —The Trump administration's unwillingness to acknowledge that former Vice President Joe Biden won the election has led to an unusual restriction on the flow of national security information to the president-elect.

In a statement to NBC News, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said it will not interface with the Biden transition until the General Services Administration decides it's clear who won, a process known as ""ascertainment.""

""ODNI follows the statutory direction provided in the Presidential Transition Act, which requires ascertainment of the candidate by the administrator of GSA prior to supporting a potential presidential transition,"" the statement said. ""ODNI would not have contact with any transition team until notified by the GSA administrator.""

More than three days after media outlets projected that Biden had defeated President Donald Trump to win the White House, GSA chief Emily Murphy had yet to sign the letter of ""ascertainment"" — a previously mostly noncontroversial process since the passage of the transition act nearly 60 years ago.

Separately, the president-elect is not receiving the President's Daily Brief, the compendium of high-level intelligence reporting that goes to the most senior officials in the government. President Donald Trump could authorize that with a word, but he has not done so.

On Tuesday, Biden confirmed to reporters that he was not receiving the daily brief. “Obviously the PDB would be useful but it’s not necessary,"" he said. ""I’m not the sitting president now.”

“Access to classified information is useful but I’m not in a position to make any decisions on these issues anyway. It would be nice to have it but it’s not critical.""

""Shame on DNI Ratcliffe for hiding behind the Presidential Transition Act,"" Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior CIA official, said. ""All it would take is a presidential head-nod to make it happen. It's in the interest of national security for Biden to receive the full PDB — this was done in 2000 for George Bush even as election challenges continued. There would be little risk in extending this courtesy to a former vice president who received the PDB for eight years.""

Biden received intelligence briefings as a presidential candidate, but they were not at the level of the PDB. And it's not clear that they are continuing now that the election is over.

Candidate briefings are an ""analytic briefing, so there's no … operations discussed, no covert actions discussed, no sources and methods discussed,"" former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell has written. ""It's simply what do we see as the threats … why do we see it that way … how those threats evolved and where might they be headed?""

David Priess, a former CIA officer who is an expert in presidential intelligence briefings, said that normally, the winning candidate would get a high level briefing immediately after the election.

The only time that didn't happen was the 2000 Gore-Bush contest, when recounts in Florida meant the winner wasn't decided until Dec. 13, said Priess, author of the 2016 book ""The President's Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings to America's Presidents from Kennedy to Obama.""

Vice President Al Gore was already getting the briefings, but the Clinton administration decided to give them to George W. Bush in early December, even before the election was decided, Priess said.

With Biden not getting intelligence briefings, it's not clear whether any of his top advisers are getting access to any classified material at all, Biden transition officials say. There also may be delays in background investigations that relate to security clearances, which could impact the Senate confirmation process, they said.

The Department of State is not facilitating calls between Biden and foreign leaders.

Also on hold is ""access to the federal agencies, the employees of the federal agencies and their expertise, and the nonpublic information of the executive branch that will help read the incoming administration into all the important work that is ongoing,"" a Biden official said. ""To be able to help make informed policy decisions. And deliver on what the American people have voted for."""
Barr authorizes election probes despite little evidence of fraud,353,jrm07o,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/barr-authorizes-election-probes-despite-little-evidence-of-fraud,173,1605047764.0,,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General William Barr has authorized federal prosecutors across the U.S. to pursue “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities, if they exist, before the 2020 presidential election is certified, despite no evidence of widespread fraud.

Barr’s action comes days after Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump and raises the prospect that Trump will use the Justice Department to try to challenge the outcome. It gives prosecutors the ability to go around longstanding Justice Department policy that normally would prohibit such overt actions before the election is certified.

Trump has not conceded the election and is instead claiming without evidence that there has been a widespread, multi-state conspiracy by Democrats to skew the vote tally in Biden’s favor.

Biden holds a sizable lead in multiple battleground states and there has been no indication of enough improperly counted or illegally cast votes that would shift the outcome. In fact, election officials from both political parties have publicly stated the election went well, though there have been minor issues that are typical in elections, including voting machines breaking and ballots that were miscast and lost.

In a memo to U.S. attorneys, obtained by The Associated Press, Barr wrote that investigations “may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.”

He said any allegations that would “clearly not impact the outcome of a federal election” should be delayed until after those elections are certified and prosecutors should likely open so-called preliminary inquiries, which would allow investigators and prosecutors to see if there is evidence that would allow them to take further investigative measures.

Barr does not identify any specific instances of purported fraud in the memo.

“While it is imperative that credible allegations be addressed in a timely and effective manner, it is equally imperative that Department personnel exercise appropriate caution and maintain the Department’s absolute commitment to fairness, neutrality and non-partisanship,” Barr wrote.

States have until Dec. 8 to resolve election disputes, including recounts and court contests over the results. Members of the Electoral College meet Dec. 14 to finalize the outcome.

On Monday night, the Justice Department’s top prosecutor for election crimes, Richard Pilger, said he would step down from that post in response to the attorney general’s memo, according to an email he sent to colleagues and obtained by the AP. He is still expected to remain as an attorney within the Justice Department’s criminal division.

Barr, a loyal ally of President Donald Trump, helped broadcast Trump’s claims of voter fraud before the election, attacking mail-in voting as prone to undue influence and coercion, despite multiple studies debunking the notion of pervasive voter fraud in general and in the vote-by-mail process.

Generally, Justice Department policy is “not to conduct overt investigations, including interviews with individual voters, until after the outcome of the election allegedly affected by the fraud is certified.”

But Barr argues in the memo that concerns such acts could inadvertently impact an election are minimized once voting has concluded and that, in some cases, investigations could not be delayed until the election is certified.

A Justice Department official said Barr had not been asked by Trump, anyone else at the White House or any lawmakers to issue the memo. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Barr was in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office on Capitol Hill on Monday afternoon and refused to answer questions from reporters when he left. Earlier Monday, McConnell threw his support behind Trump after a period of post-election silence.

Biden campaign attorney Bob Bauer said in a statement that it is “deeply unfortunate that Attorney General Barr chose to issue a memorandum that will only fuel the ‘specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims’ he professes to guard against.”

“Those are the very kind of claims that the president and his lawyers are making unsuccessfully every day, as their lawsuits are laughed out of one court after another,” Bauer said. “But, in the end, American democracy is stronger than any clumsy and cynical partisan political scheme.”"
Growing Discomfort at Law Firms Representing Trump in Election Lawsuits,295,jrdnh9,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/business/jones-day-trump-election-lawsuits.html,38,1605008946.0,,"Like many big law firms, Jones Day, whose roots go back to Cleveland in the late 1800s, has prided itself on representing controversial clients.

There was Big Tobacco. There was the Bin Laden family. There was even the hated owner of the Cleveland Browns football team as he moved the franchise to Baltimore.

Now Jones Day is the most prominent firm representing President Trump and the Republican Party as they prepare to wage a legal war challenging the results of the election. The work is intensifying concerns inside the firm about the propriety and wisdom of working for Mr. Trump, according to lawyers at the firm.

"Gun stocks tumble after upbeat vaccine news, lack of civil unrest",93,jr6v3w,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-guns/gun-stocks-tumble-after-upbeat-vaccine-news-lack-of-civil-unrest-idUSL1N2HV2B4,18,1604986201.0,,"(Reuters) - Shares of firearms sellers tumbled on Monday as promising data from a COVID-19 vaccine trial knocked stay-at-home stocks, and as civil unrest failed to materialize after Democrat Joe Biden emerged as the winner of last week’s presidential election.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

Smith & Wesson Brands SWBI.O and rival Sturm Ruger & Co RGR.N fell more than 9%, while Vista Outdoor VSTO.N, which sells ammunition and a range of sporting goods, fell over 12%.

They were among several so-called stay-at-home stocks dropping after Pfizer PFE.N said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19.

Sales of sporting goods, including hunting gear, have increased this year as consumers spend more time outdoors due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“If a vaccine that is 90% effective can truly bring COVID to an end, the return to work and school could subsequently bring sales in these categories back down to normalized levels,” Aegis Capital analyst Rommel Dionisio said in an email.

Two other big winners this year from consumers spending more time at home - Peloton Interactive PTON.O and Zoom Video Communications ZM.O - both fell more than 14%, while airlines and other companies that would benefit from an end to the health crisis rallied.

An absence of civil unrest following the election may also be hurting sentiment for gun stocks.

Worries that Joe Biden and his Democratic party would win the presidency and take control of the Senate from Republicans sent firearms sales surging in recent months, as did violent protests in several cities, and fears of new civil unrest related to Tuesday’s presidential election.

But with control of the Senate still undecided, Biden could struggle to fulfill campaign promises, including banning the sale of military style rifles.

"Detroit lawsuit alleges new problems at TCF counting center, citing 5 affidavits",0,jr6kbf,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/11/09/detroit-lawsuit-alleges-new-problems-tcf-counting-center/6223885002/,3,1604985326.0,,"A third lawsuit has been filed over Michigan's vote count, this one filed in Wayne County Circuit Court and alleging problems with the counting process at TCF Center in Detroit.

The filing relies on the affidavits of four Republican poll challengers and a city of Detroit employee who said she worked in the city's election headquarters through September, a satellite clerk's office in October and the TCF Center the day after the election.

Besides the affidavits, no actual evidence of the alleged issues was presented.

The allegations range from restrictions on poll challengers to late arriving batches of absentee ballots to the encouragement of early voters to cast their ballots for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Election officials have said they allowed the maximum number of poll watchers for both Democrats and Republicans, only restricting access to any additional poll watchers because of COVID-19 concerns.

The suit, filed by the Great Lakes Justice Center, seeks an independent audit of the election, a halt to the certification of Wayne County votes, an order voiding the county's election results and the initiation of a new election in Wayne County.

Judges in the Michigan Court of Claims and the Wayne County Circuit Court have already denied similar requests to stop the counting of Detroit ballots, citing a lack of evidence of wrongdoing.

The city of Detroit, a defendant in the case, rejected the suits as ""another belated lawsuit, raising baseless allegations"" to shake people's confidence in the election.

""Like two previous lawsuits, this case is not based upon actual evidence of any election fraud or misconduct, it is based upon various conspiracy theories, which have already been debunked,"" said David Fink, the city's lead lawyer on the case. ""We are confident this case, like the others filed last week, will be dismissed.""

It's significant, Fink said, that only five of the more than 200 GOP challengers at the TCF Center throughout the counting have come forward for the suit.

Jessy Jacob, a Detroit employee ""for decades,"" said she observed election workers trying to coach voters to cast their ballots for Joe Biden and fill out a straight Democratic ballot while voting at the satellite clerk's office ahead of the election, according to Jacob's affidavit.

Several people already issued an absentee ballot cast a separate ballot at the satellite office but did not surrender their old ballot nor did they sign an affidavit disqualifying the first ballot as required by law, Jacob said.

Last Wednesday, as ballots continued to be processed, Jacob said she worked at the TCF Center and said she was told to pre-date the absentee ballots' receipt date into the qualified voter file.

Jacob, the city said, has been on furlough since earlier this year.

City officials have explained that the receipt date of some absentee ballots was entered into the qualified voter file at the absentee counting board because some Detroit satellite clerks' office stamped the date on the absentee envelope but forgot to enter the information into the electronic voter file. Chris Thomas, Michigan's 36-year elections director who came out of retirement to help in Detroit in the Nov. 3 election, has said none of the ballots entered into the system were received after Election Day.

Another affidavit came from a former assistant attorney general who left Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel's office for the private sector in January after eight years with the office.

Zachary Larsen was working as a Republican poll challenger last Tuesday in Lansing and East Lansing before moving his efforts to the TCF Center in Detroit on Wednesday.

In his affidavit, Larsen alleged that poll workers at the TCF Center appeared to be inconsistent in deciding which ballots were placed in the ""problem ballots"" box, which he was concerned lent itself to diverting Republican ballots into the ""problem ballots"" box.

At another point, Larsen said, he was barred from viewing the supplemental polling book because he was breaching six feet of social distancing. The supplemental polling book included more recent registrations or absentee ballot drop-offs that weren't included in the qualified voter file.

""I understood that this was a ruse to keep me away from a place where I could observe the confirmation of names in the supplemental poll book,"" Larsen said in his affidavit.

He left for lunch between 1:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. Wednesday, at which point the city barred additional people from entering the TCF Center. Larsen was not able to re-enter.

Elections officials have argued that at least 134 Republican poll challengers observed the absentee ballot counting before a surge of other challengers demanded entrance that was barred because of COVID-19 capacity restrictions.

Two other affidavits — from poll challengers Andrew Sitto and Robert Cushman — alleged they were present at TCF Center when additional ballots were delivered Wednesday, past the time when the ballots should have been received. Cushman contended that the new ballots he saw were not from individuals listed on the qualified voter file or supplemental poll books.

A conservative website claimed it obtained a video from ""a poll watcher in Detroit"" that showed ""wagons, suitcases and coolers moving in and out of a vote-counting center during the early morning"" at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. But Detroit area WXYZ-TV said the man featured in the video who was wheeling equipment into the TCF Center was actually one of their photographers.

Republican former State Sen. Patrick Colbeck of Canton Township submitted an affidavit, but his name mistakenly was listed as Cushman's at least once in the affidavit.

Colbeck claimed he was denied proof that the computers used at the TCF Center were disconnected from the internet and believed that they were in fact connected to the internet.

Man featured at Giuliani press conference is a convicted sex offender,131,jr44b5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2020/11/09/man-featured-at-giuliani-press-conference-is-a-sex-offender-1335241,12,1604978107.0,,"Trenton political insiders watched with bemusement as Brooks took the podium. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Man featured at Giuliani press conference is a convicted sex offender

The first person Rudy Giuliani, the attorney for President Donald Trump, called up as a witness to baseless allegations of vote counting shenanigans in Philadelphia during a press conference last week is a sex offender who for years has been a perennial candidate in New Jersey.

“It’s such a shame. This is a democracy,” Daryl Brooks, who said he was a GOP poll watcher, said at the press conference, held at Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Northeast Philadelphia. “They did not allow us to see anything. Was it corrupt or not? But give us an opportunity as poll watchers to view all the documents — all of the ballots.”

Trenton political insiders watched with bemusement as Brooks took the podium.

Brooks was incarcerated in the 1990s on charges of sexual assault, lewdness and endangering the welfare of a minor for exposing himself to two girls ages 7 and 11, according to news accounts.

Brooks has run for various offices, including U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.

“I started watching it and all of a sudden I was like, ‘there’s New Jersey’s perennial candidate claiming to live in Philadelphia and Giuliani claiming him to be a poll watcher and Philadelphia resident,"" Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora said in a phone interview.

James Gee, chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), also said he immediately recognized Brooks.

“Yeah, I know Daryl. It’s so fitting that he would be there,” Gee said.

Gee said he believed Brooks was hired for Hillary Clinton‘s campaign in 2016.

“People don’t pay attention to who they hire. They’re just trying to get bodies, particularly if it’s a white organizer,” said Gee, who’s Black. “And this time apparently, I guess he was on the Republican side of the watchers.“

Brooks said in a phone interview late Monday morning that he did not know if Giuliani knew about his conviction, but said he didn’t think it was relevant.

“I’m not sure, but all he asked — he was asking about the truth. I told him the truth and the other ones told him the truth,” Brooks said.

He also said he did not work directly for Clinton’s campaign in 2016, but for a third-party, pro-Clinton group he declined to name.

Brooks continued to deny the charges he was convicted of, alleging the victims were the children of neighborhood drug dealers he had targeted in his community activism. He also alleged Trenton politicians he criticized played a role as well.

“I went to prison for three-and-a-half years. That’s what they said I was did. I was 25-years-old,” Brooks said. “I was an activist always doing the right thing. They lied on me. The cops set me up.”

The conviction has never been reversed.

"Trump Fires Mark Esper, His Defense Secretary",335,jr3inq,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/esper-defense-secretary.html,59,1604976345.0,,"“One would be incompetence or wrongdoing, which do not seem to be the issue with Secretary Esper,” she said. “A second would be vindictiveness, which would be an irresponsible way to treat our national security. A third would be because the president wants to take actions that he believes his secretary of defense would refuse to take, which would be alarming. Whatever the reason, casting aside a secretary of defense during the volatile days of transition seems to neglect the president’s most important duty: to protect our national security.”

Mr. Esper’s downfall had been expected for months, after he took the rare step of disagreeing publicly with Mr. Trump in June and saying that active-duty military troops should not be sent to control the wave of protests in American cities.

The defense secretary was aware that he was likely to be fired, but Pentagon officials said he hoped to continue serving as long as possible to try to sustain orderly leadership of the Defense Department. Although Mr. Esper had a resignation letter prepared, his allies said he did not think anything was imminent from Mr. Trump on Monday.

But the president expressed his ire in the Oval Office on Monday morning, and the White House gave Mr. Esper only a few minutes’ advance notice of his firing.

In a two-page letter to Mr. Trump obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Esper said, “I serve the country in deference to the Constitution, so I accept your decision to replace me.”

Friends and colleagues of the new acting secretary praised Mr. Miller’s Army Special Forces background and counterterrorism credentials but expressed surprise that he had been elevated to such a senior position, even in a temporary capacity. Mr. Miller does not have the stature to push back on any precipitous actions that Mr. Trump might press in his final weeks in office, colleagues said.

“A move like this probably sends a chill through the senior ranks of the military,” Nicholas J. Rasmussen, a former top counterterrorism official in the Bush and Obama administrations, said in an email. “Not because of anything about Chris Miller personally, though it’s a highly unconventional choice, to be sure. But simply because a move like this contributes to a sense of instability and unstable decision-making at exactly the time when you want to avoid sending that kind of message around the world.”"
Kansas Democrats want to prevent newly elected state lawmaker from being seated,161,jr123l,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/525089-kansas-democrats-want-to-prevent-newly-elected-state-lawmaker-from-being,58,1604969023.0,,"Kansas Democratic Party leaders are reportedly seeking to prevent a victorious state House candidate with a history of online harassment and sending revenge porn from being seated.

Aaron Coleman defeated incumbent state Rep. Stan Frownfelter (D) by just 14 votes in the August Democratic primary, according to The Associated Press, which added that Coleman ran unopposed in the general election with the exception of two write-in candidates.

Coleman has admitted to sending revenge porn as a teenager and said he would withdraw from the race, but later reversed himself, the AP reported. Since then, an ex-girlfriend has come forward with allegations that he physically abused her, it noted.

State Democrats have reportedly since distanced themselves further from Coleman over tweets he sent about the likelihood Gov. Laura Kelly (D) would face a primary challenge, including one that read, “I’m not playing around. People will realize one day when I call a hit out on you it’s real.”

Asked for comment by The Hill, Coleman said he is ""focused on getting to work for the voters of district 37"" and not currently responding to the press.

Coleman has deleted the tweets and denied they were meant as a reference to literal violence, according to the AP.

“My tweets were a political call for action for progressives to run against establishment candidates,” he said, according to The New York Times. “Many of my constituents have agreed with the statement and actually read my tweets in their whole context.”

“Kansas House Democrats will take every necessary step to ensure Coleman is not seated in the Legislature,” state House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer (D) said, the Times reported. “With Republican cooperation, I believe we can resolve this issue and find a replacement who is competent, stable and principled to serve the 37th District.”

Sawyer told the AP that he or Democratic colleagues intend to file a formal complaint against Coleman once he’s sworn in. Members of the body can be removed with a two-thirds vote. Coleman, however, said his lawyer has told him he can only be removed for misconduct while in office.

“Until I break the public’s trust and I break my oath of office, you know, you cannot undo the results of democracy,” Coleman said, according to the AP.

EU holds 'great expectations' for president-elect Biden in trade,10,jqwqw8,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-eu/eu-holds-great-expectations-for-president-elect-biden-in-trade-idUSL8N2HV25F,5,1604953802.0,,"BRUSSELS, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The European Union has “great expectations” of a new U.S. president and hopes the United States will re-engage in multilateral trade talks, EU officials said on Monday.

EU ministers responsible for trade were meeting by video conference on Monday, two days after Democrat Joe Biden clinched the presidency. President Donald Trump, with whom Europe has had strained relations, has not conceded and is making legal challenges to the outcome of the Nov. 3 election.

“There are great expectations and the hope that the American presidential elections will lead to a return to multilateral engagement in international trade and that it will be possible to overcome past conflicts,” German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told a news conference before the ministers met.

EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said the European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 27 EU member states, had made some informal contacts with Team Biden.

“So some first contacts have been made, among other things also to discuss trade issues,” he said.

The EU wants the United States to remove U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium and resolve a dispute over civil aircraft subsidies for planemakers Boeing and Airbus.

The bloc is ready to impose extra duties on $4 billion of U.S. imports after a World Trade Organization award in a case on Boeing. The United States already has tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU products approved in a parallel WTO case related to Airbus.

Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission, repeated an EU offer that the bloc would suspend its measures if the United States did the same, but said Washington had so far not agreed to do so.

“We are ready to suspend or withdraw our tariffs any time when the U.S. suspends or withdraws their tariffs. We are ready to do it any time,” he said. (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Editing by Timothy Heritage)"
Covid vaccine: First vaccine offers 90% protection,63,jqwo8v,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54873105,9,1604953461.0,,"Covid vaccine: First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection By James Gallagher

Health and science correspondent Published 9 November 2020

The first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows.

The developers - Pfizer and BioNTech - described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"".

Their vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised.

The companies plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of the month.

No vaccine has gone from the drawing board to being proven highly effective in such a short period of time.

There are still huge challenges ahead, but the announcement has been warmly welcomed with scientists describing themselves smiling ""ear to ear"" and some suggesting life could be back to normal by spring.

""I am probably the first guy to say that, but I will say that with some confidence,"" said Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University.

How effective could it be?

A vaccine - alongside better treatments - is seen as the best way of getting out of the restrictions that have been imposed on all our lives.

The data shows that two doses, three weeks apart, are needed. The trials - in US, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Turkey - show 90% protection is achieved seven days after the second dose.

However, the data presented is not the final analysis as it is based on only the first 94 volunteers to develop Covid so the precise effectiveness of the vaccine may change when the full results are analysed.

Dr Albert Bourla, the chairman of Pfizer, said: ""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis.""

Prof Ugur Sahin, one of the founders of BioNTech, described the results as a ""milestone"".

media caption Sarah Montague reacted with excitement upon hearing Professor Bell's views on the significance of today's vaccine news

When will the vaccine be available?

A limited number of people may get the vaccine this year.

Pfizer and BioNTech say they will have enough safety data by the third week of November to take their vaccine to regulators.

Until it has been approved it will not be possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns.

The two companies say they will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Each person needs two doses.

The UK should get 10 million doses by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered.

Who would get it?

Not everyone will get the vaccine straight away and countries are each deciding who should be prioritised.

Hospital staff and care home workers will be near the top of every list because of the vulnerable people they work with, as will the elderly who are most at risk of severe disease.

The UK is likely to prioritise older resident in care homes and the people that work there.

But it says a final decision has not been made, saying it will depend on how well the vaccine works in different age-groups and how the virus is spreading.

People under 50 and with no medical problems are likely to be last in the queue.

Are there any potential problems?

There are still many unanswered questions as this is only interim data.

We do not know if the vaccine stops you spreading the virus or just from developing symptoms. Or if it works equally well in high-risk elderly people.

The biggest question - how long does immunity last - will take months or potentially years to answer.

There are also massive manufacturing and logistical challenges in immunising huge numbers of people, as the vaccine has to be kept in ultra-cold storage at below minus 80C.

The vaccine appears safe from the large trials so far but nothing, including paracetamol, is 100% safe.

How does it work?

There are around a dozen vaccines in the final stages of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - but this is the first to show any results.

It uses a completely experimental approach - that involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code - in order to train the immune system.

Previous trials have shown the vaccine trains the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus.

What has the reaction been?

The UK's chief medical advisor Prof Chris Whitty said the results showed the ""power of science"" and was a ""reason for optimism"" for 2021.

Preliminary news that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is effective demonstrates the power of science against COVID. We must see the final safety and efficacy data, but it is very encouraging.



It is essential we continue to suppress COVID, but it is a reason for optimism for 2021. — Professor Chris Whitty (@CMO_England) November 9, 2020 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter

The US president-elect Joe Biden said it was ""excellent news"".

""It is also important to understand that the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away,"" he added.

The UK Prime Minister's official spokesman said the results were ""promising"" and that ""the NHS stands ready to begin a vaccination programme for those most at risk once a Covid-19 vaccine is available"".

Prof Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford, said: ""This news made me smile from ear to ear.

""It is a relief... there is a long long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment.""

It now includes not just a cabal of pollsters, mainstream media outlets, and corrupt Democrats but also Republican officials and Trump-friendly new organizations.

The president's assertion that the election was ""stolen"" posits massive, orchestrated fraud. But one study after another has found that voting fraud is very rare, and there is no evidence this year is an exception.

In Nevada, for example, Biden won by about 31,000 votes, according to unofficial results. The CBS station in Las Vegas says Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, ""reports there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud.""

In Georgia, where Biden is currently leading by about 10,000 votes, the election system is run by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a former Republican state legislator who was endorsed by Trump when he ran for his current position. Last week the president nevertheless claimed ""the election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.""

On Friday, Raffensperger rejected insinuations that the state's vote counting system is corrupt. ""The stakes are high and emotions are high on all sides,"" he told reporters. ""We will not let that debate distract us from our work. We will get it right….We're committed to doing everything we can to maintain trust in our electoral process. If somebody has a credible complaint and some evidence, they can give our office a call."" Gabriel Sterling, voting systems manager at Raffensperger's office, said election officials had not seen any ""widespread irregularities.""

Biden beat Trump by about 41,000 votes in Pennsylvania, which clinched his victory by delivering 20 Electoral College votes. Pennsylvania's secretary of state, Kathy Boockvar, is a Democrat. But Fox News correspondent Brian Llenas reports ""there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania."" He adds: ""The American people deserve to see fact based evidence to support these claims of voter fraud. Especially at the levels being alleged. There is no evidence of it in PA at the levels being claimed. Thankfully there are courts that will [distinguish] fact from opinions on this matter.""

""Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be?"" Trump wondered on Twitter today. Yet Fox, once Trump's favorite news source, joined other major outlets this weekend in declaring Biden the winner of the presidential election.

Sen. Patrick Toomey (R–Pa.) likewise is not buying Trump's claims about fraud in Pennsylvania. ""The president's allegations of large-scale fraud and theft of the election are just not substantiated,"" he told NBC News on Friday. ""I'm not aware of any significant wrongdoing here.""

The New York Post, which no one would mistake for a pro-Biden newspaper, last week called Trump's allegations ""baseless"" in the headline of a news report. Today the Post noted that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Trump himself, and ""others within the president's orbit"" have ""repeatedly made allegations of widespread and organized fraud since Election Day, but have not provided hard evidence to back up the claim.""

""I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!"" Trump insisted yesterday. Nearly everyone, it seems, is conspiring to deny that reality."
"Don't judge Kane on goals alone, says Mourinho",0,jqk0gs,https://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-wba-tot-report-idINL4N2HU0BD,3,1604899802.0,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Jose Mourinho insists striker Harry Kane’s influence for Tottenham Hotspur goes way beyond the 201 goals he has now scored for the north London club, after the England skipper sealed a 1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Sunday.

Kane headed Tottenham’s winner in the 88th minute at the Hawthorns, breaking the resistance of a rugged West Brom side and putting Spurs top of the Premier League until Leicester City beat Wolverhampton Wanderers later to replace them.

It was his 150th Premier League goal in 218 appearances and continued a sensational start to the season for Kane who has scored 13 goals and 10 assists in 14 matches in all competitions for his club this season.

“Harry Kane you have to say has this many goals, this many assists, this number of balls recovered, this number of duels won,” Mourinho said when asked to rate the striker.

“When you go to stats in relation to the strikers, I always say that the stats should be how many goals has a striker scored, and what he did for his team in the matches where he didn’t score. And many of the strikers that history will show an incredible number of goals that they score, plus zero.”

Tottenham have amassed 17 points from their opening eight games and could have more had they not conceded last-gasp equalisers against Newcastle United and West Ham United, the latter having been 3-0 ahead.

Since that the meltdown against West Ham they have won three successive league games despite not being at their best against Burnley, Brighton and Hove Albion and West Brom.

Tougher tests await after the international break with a run of games against Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool, but Mourinho says his side have toughened up.

“I am not going to say we are not going to lose matches or lose points in the last minutes, it can happen to anyone,” the Portuguese said. “We felt the pain against West Ham and since then strategically the team is behaving in a different way.

“The two clean sheets at Burnley and this afternoon showed the lesson -- a team in the last five minutes that was very solid, it looked like the pain made a positive effort and the team improved after that.”"

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Alabama voters reversed themselves from a few years ago and removed racist vestiges of segregation from the state constitution that courts long ago ruled unconstitutional. Rhode Island did a similar a U-turn to eradicate the word “plantations” from the state’s official name.

In a year when discussions of racial justice have dominated U.S. society like few others, five states voted to cleanse the public sphere of words, phrases and symbols that to many were painful reminders of the nation’s history of slavery and the systematic oppression of Black people.

Brendan Skip Mark, who teaches political science at the University of Rhode Island, believes the decisions were linked to the revulsion and widespread protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in May.

“In many ways this has sparked a national conversation on race, and I think we’ve seen a lot of people who are more willing to take concrete steps to address racism than they were in the past,” Mark said.

In addition to the votes in Alabama and Rhode Island, residents of Utah and Nebraska decided to strip their constitutions of unenforceable provisions that allowed slavery as a punishment for criminal convictions. And Mississippi voters approved a state flag without the familiar X-shaped design of the Confederate battle flag.

The votes are a positive sign in a nation where racial tension always has existed, said Stacy Moak, who teaches in the social work department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

“Affirmative votes for these changes shows a willingness on the part of Americans to provide for a more inclusive community. These changes, by themselves, are not enough — but they are encouraging signs of progress in the right direction,” she said in an interview conducted by email.

The Alabama measure begins the process of removing Jim Crow language from the 1901 Constitution that was intended to entrench white supremacy. Voters in the mostly white, conservative state had rejected similar proposals twice since 2000.

Courts had previously struck down the legality of the segregationist provisions that were enshrined in the document long ago, but the language banning mixed-race marriage, allowing poll taxes and mandating school segregation remained.

Glenn Crowell, a Black Republican from Montgomery, was among the roughly 67% of voters who supported scrapping those sections.

“It just doesn’t make any sense nowadays,” said Crowell, 63. Yet another statewide vote will be required to approve the revisions after legislators consider a draft in 2022.

In neighboring Mississippi, about 71% of voters approved a new state flag featuring a magnolia and the words “In God We Trust” to replace the Confederate-themed flag that state legislators voted to retire in June after the nation erupted in demonstrations following Floyd’s killing.

Mississippi voters also eliminated an 1890s provision that aimed to ensure white control of the state by requiring majorities of both the popular vote and the 122 state House districts to win statewide office. Now, only a popular vote majority is required.

To the west, Utah and Nebraska approved provisions similar to Alabama’s to delete constitutional language allowing slavery as a possible punishment in criminal cases.

The measures, which passed by 81% in Utah and 68% in Nebraska, got relatively little attention before the vote.

But the fact that states even placed the measures on ballots shows that protests and the national discussion on racism are having an impact, said Deirdre Cooper Owens, director of the humanities in medicine program at the University of Nebraska.

“Symbolism matters, and so does language,” she said by email.

The vote was closest in Rhode Island, once a hub of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, where about 53% of voters supported the proposal to strip the words “and Providence Plantations” from the state’s formal name, first adopted in 1790. A similar measure failed in 2010.

Like elsewhere in the country, Rhode Island has seen protests over Floyd’s death, and in racially diverse Providence, a truth commission was established to consider the state’s historic ties to slavery, land seizures, systemic racism and possible reparations.

“This ballot initiative is part of a broader shift in Rhode Island to reconcile with the past,” said Mark, the political scientist. “I think this is a unique moment in history.”

All those ballot measures involved changing symbols or wiping away reminders of injustices of long ago. In California, where voters were asked to reconsider a more contemporary race-related issue, they balked.

The liberal-minded state rejected a proposition that would have repealed a 1996 initiative prohibiting affirmative action programs in public employment, education or contracting. Supporters said the measure lost for several reasons, including a lack of time to persuade voters during a busy election year."

Abbas had ended all political dealings with President Donald Trump’s administration after the U.S. leader’s 2017 decisions to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and to move the U.S. Embassy there.

“I congratulate President-elect Joe Biden on his victory as President of the United States of America for the coming period,” Abbas said in a statement issued from his office in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

“I look forward to working with the President-elect and his administration to strengthen the Palestinian-American relations and to achieve freedom, independence, justice and dignity for our people,” the statement continued.

Trump’s moves, which broke with decades of U.S. policy, had delighted Israel but infuriated the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as a future capital and considered Trump’s backing for Israel as undermining their own goal of statehood.

Abbas’s boycott was popular among Palestinians, who celebrated Trump’s defeat on Sunday on the streets.

But, even as security contacts with Washington continued behind the scenes, the Palestinian leadership felt increasingly isolated, especially after Israel signed agreements with Gulf Arab states to normalise ties.

In the days before the election Abbas’s inner circle met to discuss whether they should resume political contacts with the White House if Biden won, a Palestinian official told Reuters.

Bassam Al-Salhe, a senior member of the Abbas-led Palestine Liberation Organization, said on Sunday the boycott was primarily linked to what he called “the hostile policy” of Trump’s administration.

“When Biden announces that this is going to change - and he announced that during his election campaign - there will be no reason for the boycott,” he said.

BIDEN HOPES

Biden has said he would restore funding to the West Bank and Gaza that Trump had cut, including assistance delivered through the U.S. Agency for International Development and U.N. agencies.

He has also in the past opposed Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank, and voiced support for a two-state solution to the conflict, a formula that would see a future state of Palestine co-existing alongside Israel.

But he is not likely to reverse the Jerusalem and embassy decisions and Biden has welcomed Israel’s rapprochements with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan, even as Palestinians condemned those moves.

Among the Palestinians hit hardest by Trump were refugees, following his 2018 decision to cut off all U.S. funding - more than $300 million annually - to UNRWA, the United Nations agency.

“Trump’s losing is a gain for us, for the Palestinian people, because he had sold out the Palestinian cause,” said Anwar Abu Amira, 38, a refugee in Gaza’s Beach Camp.

“Since he took office until he lost, he has been trying to wipe out the Palestinian identity,” Abu Amira said.

Gaza political analyst Hani Habib said the Biden win would encourage Abbas to re-engage in negotiations with Israel, a move the international community has long called for.

He said this might complicate Abbas’s efforts to reconcile with his principal domestic rivals, the Islamist movement Hamas, although Habib said Biden would not address the issue soon.

“When it comes to foreign policy, Biden has far more important and immediate issues than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict such as Iran, NATO and the alliance with Europe.”"
"Trump Team Holds News Conference Outside Drab Landscaping Firm, Next to Adult Book Store",354,jq3sb1,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/four-seasons-total-landscaping-trump-team-news-conference.html,49,1604831467.0,,"On Saturday morning, shortly before the AP and other news outlets called the election for Joe Biden, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to announce that his lawyers would be holding a “big press conference” in Philadelphia. But there seems to have been some major confusion about where it would be held. First Trump tweeted it would take place at the “Four Seasons, Philadelphia.” Trump later corrected himself and said that the news conference was going to be held at the Four Seasons Total Landscaping. And the Four Seasons Hotel sent out its own tweet, making sure everyone knew that the news conference would not be held there but rather at the landscaping business that has “no relation with the hotel.”

When journalists arrived at the site of the news conference, they were flabbergasted by the scene and many quickly speculated that someone in the Trump campaign made a serious mistake. After all, the parking lot of a landscaping business in the outskirts of the city in an industrial part of town was a drab backdrop for a news conference by a president who wanted to convince Americans he still had a chance of winning. And making matters even stranger, the landscaping business was between an adult bookstore and a cremation center. The location led to lots of mockery online, and many people were very happy with the scene that was ripe for mockery, and some saw as a poignant metaphor of the failure of the Trump campaign.

At the news conference, Rudy Giuliani insisted that Trump was not going to concede the election and claimed without presenting any evidence that ballots had been tampered with in Pennsylvania. It seems Giuliani first heard that that the networks had called the election for Biden at the news conference, and he vowed that the campaign would file several lawsuits because Republican observers were not allowed to inspect ballots. “Seems to me somebody from the Democratic National Committee sent out a note that said don’t let the Republicans look at those mail-in ballots,” Giuliani said without any evidence."

Updated at 3:16 p.m. ET



There may be no media figure more important in preparing Republicans and President Trump himself for a post-Trump period than magnate Rupert Murdoch.

Among his properties, the top-rated Fox News Channel stands out, its role in shaping conservative thought and Republican Party politics unrivaled, at least within media. Murdoch allied himself with Trump despite holding the former reality show host in low esteem. And Fox has been one of Trump's strongest sources of support. So how the channel presented Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's rising election fortunes matters. Deeply.

On Tuesday night, Fox News became the first major news outlet to declare that Biden would win Arizona. An angry Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, dialed Murdoch to demand he reverse the network's call. Pro-Trump supporters in Maricopa County, Ariz. — some of them armed — led chants of ""Fox sucks."" And for days, the network's top opinion hosts gave ballast to the president's unfounded and corrosive claims of voter fraud by Democrats, seeking to discredit the entire electoral process.

Fox News' journalists, by and large, have attempted to navigate a gentle landing for their audiences so that they recognize Trump has lost the election. But the network's stars have larded their shows with Trump advocates. All this week, they've made baseless but incendiary accusations to ensure that viewers never accept Biden as legitimate.

Murdoch threw his weight and his media outlets behind the president early on, although his Wall Street Journal's news pages have also offered muscular investigative reporting on Trump. That alliance has served Murdoch well, giving him full and frequent access to Trump as well as a presidential seal of approval on his sale of entertainment properties to Disney despite antitrust concerns.

The president considers many Fox News figures among his closest advisers. These include Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro and others. He has drawn from the ranks of Fox contributors to fill senior White House appointments and even considered stars for Cabinet positions. And they, in turn, have been ferocious in relaying the president's baseless claims, winning his frequent appearances on their programs and stratospheric ratings in response.

Earlier this year, Fox News stars helped whip up protests in opposition to shutdowns related to COVID-19 and orders to wear masks. Fox News stars stoked potential scandals involving Biden's son Hunter based on unauthenticated reports from Murdoch's New York Post — material Fox's own reporters largely could not validate.

As one small sign of the ways in which Fox and Trump Republicans can orchestrate programming, on Friday evening, NPR reviewed an internal GOP memo sent to top party officials to prepare Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel for her appearance on Hannity's show that night. It set out in great specificity the intended flow of the show's lengthy opening segment — including its guests, articles and subjects — and the primary points Hannity would make. The two jointly focused on stoking suspicions of voter fraud. (The RNC confirmed the memo's authenticity but declined to comment on the collaboration.)

After Fox's election project decision desk called Arizona for Biden late Tuesday night local time, the Trump campaign put out a statement trashing its head, Arnon Mishkin, who later appeared on-air to acknowledge he had done work for Democrats in the past. One Republican senator, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, accused Fox of a cover-up in a radio interview and called on the network to fire Mishkin. ""Fox News owes the American people an apology,"" he said.

The network stood by its decision desk.

But others say the Murdochs need to do more to help viewers accept the verdict of the American public. CNN anchor Jake Tapper said on-air, ""The Murdochs and the people at Fox have an obligation to put their country above their profits."" Murdoch's liberal daughter-in-law Kathryn Murdoch tweeted that she agreed. She is married to Murdoch's younger son, James, who is no longer a top executive within the family media empire, though he retains a major stake.

And the culture clash between the network's top news anchors and its brightest stars, many of whom climbed aboard the Trump train to ratings glory, is at its most stark.

""The [question about] transparency and watching the ballots is different than finding fraud that narrows the gap,"" anchor Bret Baier told McDaniel, the GOP chairwoman, on the air Friday morning. ""There's all kinds of stuff flying on the Internet. But when we look into it, it doesn't pan out.""

He and anchor Martha MacCallum sounded like they were staging an intervention: They were affirming, even soothing McDaniel, while taking issue with the substance of her claims.

Compare that with Hannity's rhetoric on Thursday night: ""Americans will never be able to believe in the integrity and legitimacy of these [election] results."" Or Dobbs, who condemned GOP lawmakers Thursday for being insufficiently loyal to Trump: ""I don't even hear thank yous, let alone engagement to do the right thing and stop this corruption at the ballot on the part of the Democrats.""

Fox's conservative stars gave guests uncritical time to make baseless claims bashing the integrity of the electoral system, as Trump has for weeks.

""President Trump won this election,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said without offering any evidence. ""So everyone who's listening: Do not be quiet. Do not be silent about this. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes."" (McCarthy later claimed he was referring to Trump's winning seats in the House for Republicans, not the White House, but that would render the rest of his comments incomprehensible.)

CNN reported Friday that Fox News anchors had received a memo warning them not to call Biden ""president-elect"" even if the network projected him to win Nevada's six electoral votes. (Because of the Arizona projection, that would give Biden enough to secure the network's call for the presidency.) According to a Fox News staffer, midlevel producers were advising on-air journalists to await more concrete direction from the network's Washington desk before bestowing that title. A Fox News spokesperson said there have been no networkwide memos or editorial guidance from Fox News.

Later in the day, Baier and Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace went out of their way to indicate Biden would be president-elect should he win Pennsylvania or another state.

On Thursday, the New York Post published online two stories deeply discounting claims made by Trump in his White House remarks that night and in an earlier tweet from his son Donald Jr.

What Trump and his supporters may forget is that Murdoch's conservatism is tempered by his pragmatism. He is always in the business of finding a way to do business. And he very much wants to back a winner. Which means, at times, that Murdoch and his properties pivot — severely.

Just after Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney went down to defeat in 2012, Hannity announced he had had an ""evolution"" on immigration. It happened within 24 hours of then-Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes telling his broadcasting team that people in the U.S. without legal status could no longer be demonized as illegal immigrants. (Ailes, and Fox, would later backslide in a big way on that conclusion.)

And indeed, on Friday, after a fairly fiery hour of Hannity's show, Laura Ingraham encouraged Trump to depart the scene with dignity, should the occasion arise. (And yes, Fox hosts do communicate with Trump by speaking directly on the air as well as off.) ""President Trump's legacy will only become more significant if he focuses on moving the country forward,"" Ingraham said. ""And then the love and respect his supporters feel for him? It's only going to grow stronger.""

Now you can watch Fox's conservative hosts on the air — the ones who make the network so profitable — maintain their loyalty to Trump, while the news side gently pulls the network into the orbit of political gravity. How deftly the network negotiates that shift more completely — and how soon it does so — will help determine how readily its viewers, the president's fans and the president himself come to terms with the political reality.

Murdoch's Fox will always emerge to greet another day. It flourished during the Clinton and Obama administrations. ""The news cycle will moderate,"" Fox Corp. Executive Chairman and CEO Lachlan Murdoch, Rupert's older son, told investors this week. ""We fully expect to be No. 1 and maintain share through that.""

And it's pretty clear what Fox News would look like under a Biden administration: giving airtime to potential Republican presidential hopefuls and attacking Joe and Hunter Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and young progressive House stars, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

As much as Murdoch covets access to power, his media outlets are always most at home in muscular opposition."
"Biden wins White House, vowing new direction for divided US",614,jpts52,https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-us-election-2020-results-fd58df73aa677acb74fce2a69adb71f9,145,1604795448.0,,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States on Saturday and offered himself to the nation as a leader who “seeks not to divide, but to unify” a country gripped by a historic pandemic and a confluence of economic and social turmoil.

“I sought this office to restore the soul of America,” Biden said in a prime-time victory speech not far from his Delaware home, “and to make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home.”

Biden crossed the winning threshold of 270 Electoral College votes with a win in Pennsylvania. His victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mail-in votes that delayed processing.

Trump refused to concede, threatening further legal action on ballot counting. But Biden used his acceptance speech as an olive branch to those who did not vote for him, telling Trump voters that he understood their disappointment but adding, “Let’s give each other a chance.”

“It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, to lower the temperature, to see each other again, to listen to each other again, to make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy,” he said. “We are not enemies. We are Americans.”

Biden, 77, staked his candidacy less on any distinctive political ideology than on galvanizing a broad coalition of voters around the notion that Trump posed an existential threat to American democracy. The strategy, as well as an appeal to Americans fatigued by Trump’s disruptions and wanting a return to a more traditional presidency, proved effective and resulted in pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Pennsylvania, onetime Democratic bastions that had flipped to Trump in 2016.

Biden’s victory was a repudiation of Trump’s divisive leadership and the president-elect now inherits a deeply polarized nation grappling with foundational questions of racial justice and economic fairness while in the grips of a virus that has killed more than 236,000 Americans and reshaped the norms of everyday life.

Kamala Harris made history as the first Black woman to become vice president, an achievement that comes as the U.S. faces a reckoning on racial justice. The California senator, who is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency, will become the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government, four years after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.

Harris introduced Biden at their evening victory celebration as “a president for all Americans” who would look to bridge a nation riven with partisanship and she nodded to the historic nature of her ascension to the vice presidency.

“Dream with ambition, lead with conviction and see yourselves in a way that others may not simply because they’ve never seen it before,” Harris told Americans. “You chose hope and unity, decency, science and, yes, truth ... you ushered in a new day for America.”

After he spoke, the cars at the drive-in rally — a pandemic campaign invention — began to honk their horns and a fireworks display lit up the night sky. Biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million, a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted.

Nonetheless, Trump was not giving up.

Departing from longstanding democratic tradition and signaling a potentially turbulent transfer of power, he issued a combative statement saying his campaign would take unspecified legal actions. And he followed up with a bombastic, all-caps tweet in which he falsely declared, “I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES.” Twitter immediately flagged it as misleading.

Trump has pointed to delays in processing the vote in some states to allege with no evidence that there was fraud and to argue that his rival was trying to seize power — an extraordinary charge by a sitting president trying to sow doubt about a bedrock democratic process.

Trump is the first incumbent president to lose reelection since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992.

He was golfing at his Virginia country club when he lost the race. He stayed out for hours, stopping to congratulate a bride as he left, and his motorcade returned to the White House to a cacophony of shouts, taunts and unfriendly hand gestures.

In Wilmington, Delaware, near the stage that, until Saturday night, had stood empty since it was erected to celebrate on Election Night, people cheered and pumped their fists as the news that the presidential race had been called for the state’s former senator arrived on their cellphones.

On the nearby water, two men in a kayak yelled to a couple paddling by in the opposite direction, “Joe won! They called it!” as people on the shore whooped and hollered. Harris, in workout gear, was shown on video speaking to Biden on the phone, exuberantly telling the president-elect “We did it!”

Across the country, there were parties and prayer. In New York City, spontaneous block parties broke out. People ran out of their buildings, banging on pots. They danced and high-fived with strangers amid honking horns. Among the loudest cheers were those for passing U.S. Postal Service trucks.

People streamed into Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, near where Trump had ordered the clearing of protesters in June, waving signs and taking cellphone pictures. In Lansing, Michigan, Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter demonstrators filled the Capitol steps. The lyrics to “Amazing Grace” began to echo through the crowd, and Trump supporters laid their hands on a counter protester, and prayed.

Americans showed deep interest in the presidential race. A record 103 million voted early this year, opting to avoid waiting in long lines at polling locations during a pandemic. With counting continuing in some states, Biden had already received more than 75 million votes, more than any presidential candidate before him.

Trump’s refusal to concede has no legal implications. But it could add to the incoming administration’s challenge of bringing the country together after a bitter election.

Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, arguing without evidence that the election could be marred by fraud. The nation has a long history of presidential candidates peacefully accepting the outcome of elections, dating back to 1800, when John Adams conceded to his rival Thomas Jefferson.

It was Biden’s native Pennsylvania that put him over the top, the state he invoked throughout the campaign to connect with working class voters. He also won Nevada on Saturday pushing his total to 290 Electoral College votes.

Biden received congratulations from dozens of world leaders, and his former boss, President Barack Obama, saluted him in a statement, declaring the nation was “fortunate that Joe’s got what it takes to be President and already carries himself that way.”

Republicans on Capitol Hill were giving Trump and his campaign space to consider all their legal options. It was a precarious balance for Trump’s allies as they try to be supportive of the president -- and avoid risking further fallout -- but face the reality of the vote count.

On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had not yet made any public statements -- either congratulating Biden or joining Trump’s complaints. But retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is close to McConnell, said, “After counting every valid vote and allowing courts to resolve disputes, it is important to respect and promptly accept the result.”

More than 237,000 Americans have died during the coronavirus pandemic, nearly 10 million have been infected and millions of jobs have been lost. The final days of the campaign played out against a surge in confirmed cases in nearly every state, including battlegrounds such as Wisconsin that swung to Biden.

The pandemic will soon be Biden’s to tame, and he campaigned pledging a big government response, akin to what Franklin D. Roosevelt oversaw with the New Deal during the Depression of the 1930s. He announced that, as his transition kicks into high gear, he would on Monday appoint his own coronavirus task force.

But Senate Republicans fought back several Democratic challengers and looked to retain a fragile majority that could serve as a check on some of Biden’s ambitions.

The 2020 campaign was a referendum on Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which has shuttered schools across the nation, disrupted businesses and raised questions about the feasibility of family gatherings heading into the holidays.

The fast spread of the coronavirus transformed political rallies from standard campaign fare to gatherings that were potential public health emergencies. It also contributed to an unprecedented shift to voting early and by mail and prompted Biden to dramatically scale back his travel and events to comply with restrictions. The president defied calls for caution and ultimately contracted the disease himself.

Trump was saddled throughout the year by negative assessments from the public of his handling of the pandemic. There was another COVID-19 outbreak in the White House this week, which sickened his chief of staff Mark Meadows.

Biden also drew a sharp contrast to Trump through a summer of unrest over the police killings of Black Americans including Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minneapolis. Their deaths sparked the largest racial protest movement since the civil rights era. Biden responded by acknowledging the racism that pervades American life, while Trump emphasized his support of police and pivoted to a “law and order” message that resonated with his largely white base.

The third president to be impeached, though acquitted in the Senate, Trump will leave office having left an indelible imprint in a tenure defined by the shattering of White House norms and a day-to-day whirlwind of turnover, partisan divide and Twitter blasts.

Trump’s team has filed a smattering of lawsuits in battleground states, some of which were immediately rebuffed by judges. His personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was holding a news conference in Philadelphia threatening more legal action when the race was called.

Biden, born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and raised in Delaware, was one of the youngest candidates ever elected to the Senate. Before he took office, his wife and daughter were killed, and his two sons badly injured in a 1972 car crash.

Commuting every night on a train from Washington back to Wilmington, Biden fashioned an everyman political persona to go along with powerful Senate positions, including chairman of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees. Some aspects of his record drew critical scrutiny from fellow Democrats, including his support for the 1994 crime bill, his vote for the 2003 Iraq War and his management of the Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court hearings.

Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign was done in by plagiarism allegations, and his next bid in 2008 ended quietly. But later that year, he was tapped to be Barack Obama’s running mate and he became an influential vice president, steering the administration’s outreach to both Capitol Hill and Iraq.

While his reputation was burnished by his time in office and his deep friendship with Obama, Biden stood aside for Clinton and opted not to run in 2016 after his adult son Beau died of brain cancer the year before.

Trump’s tenure pushed Biden to make one more run as he declared that “the very soul of the nation is at stake.”

The Trump administration abruptly dumped the leaders of three agencies that oversee the nuclear weapons stockpile, electricity and natural gas regulation, and overseas aid during the past two days, drawing a rebuke from a prominent Republican senator for one of the decisions.

The sudden departures included:

Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the first woman to oversee the agency in charge of the nuclear stockpile. She was required to resign on Friday.

Bonnie Glick, deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. She was replaced by acting Administrator John Barsa, who had run out of time for his more senior role under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

Neil Chatterjee, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He was replaced as chairman, though he will remain at FERC, an independent agency, as a commissioner.

The firings were overshadowed by the prolonged drama of the presidential election.

The White House declined comment on the firings and declined to say whether there would be more in the wake of the election.

Sen. Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement criticizing Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who he said ""effectively demanded"" the resignation of Gordon-Hagerty. (The National Nuclear Security Administration is a semi-autonomous agency that is part of the Energy Department.)

Inhofe called Gordon-Hagerty ""an exemplary public servant and remarkable leader"" and said Brouillette's decision ""during this time of uncertainty demonstrates he doesn't know what he's doing in national security matters and shows a complete lack of respect for the semi-autonomous nature of NNSA."""

BOSTON (AP) — A texting company run by one of President Donald Trump’s top campaign officials sent out thousands of targeted, anonymous text messages urging supporters to rally where votes were being counted in Philadelphia on Thursday, falsely claiming Democrats were trying to steal the presidential election.

The messages directed Trump fans to converge at a downtown intersection where hundreds of protesters from the opposing candidates’ camps faced off Thursday afternoon. Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state where former Vice President Joe Biden’s jumped ahead Friday and in a televised address later predicted a victory that would give him the presidency.

“This kind of message is playing with fire, and we are very lucky that it does not seem to have driven more conflict,” said John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s online watchdog Citizen Lab. Scott-Railton helped track down the source.

The texts were sent using phone numbers leased to the text-messaging platform Opn Sesame, said two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition they not be further identified. The company’s CEO is Gary Coby, the Trump campaign’s digital director. It provides text-messaging services to GOP clients including the Republican National Committee.

“ALERT: Radical Liberals & Dems are trying to steal this election from Trump! We need YOU!” the text said, directing recipients to “show your support” on a street corner near the Philadelphia Convention Center where votes were being counted and tensions were running high.

A top Trump campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the message did not come from the campaign. Because Opn Sesame is used by multiple customers, none of whom the company would identify, it could not be determined exactly who sent the message. Coby declined to comment.

Opn Sesame’s connection with the messages was first reported by The Washington Post.

Among those who received the rallying text was Chris Bray, who lives in rural Bucks County, about 25 miles outside Philadelphia.

A registered Independent who said he voted for Biden, Bray said he was very surprised to see the message pop up on his phone since he never signed up for anything related to the Trump campaign.

“I actually texted a number of other friends to say ‘hey, have you guys been getting robo-texts like this?’” Bray said Friday. “It was a call to action. It borders on that the rhetoric that we’ve been hearing for months now and that’s really dangerous if you get the right people together with a slight screw loose, we just don’t know what can happen.”

Later Thursday night, two men were arrested near the convention center for carrying loaded handguns without a permit, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. District Attorney Larry Krasner said there were no indications they were part of an extremist group. Their vehicle bore a window sticker for the right-wing conspiracy theory QAnon and an AR-style rifle and ammunition inside, Outlaw said.

The text messages were sent using 13 different phone numbers identified by RoboKiller, a mobile phone app that lets users block text and voice spam, said company vice president Giulia Porter. RoboKiller traced the numbers to Twilio, a gateway for bulk-messaging services.

After being notified, Twilio shut down the numbers, saying in a statement that the texts “were sent without consumer opt-out language, which is in direct contravention of our policies.” A company spokesman declined further comment.

About 80 million political text messages have been sent daily since September in the U.S. — many of those from the Trump camp echoing his baseless claims that Democrats were trying to steal the election, said RoboKiller’s Porter. They are highly targeted.

Political text-messaging campaigns can exploit the same flaws in telecommunications infrastructure that let robocallers hide their origin. They can spoof the numbers they call from and auto-blast thousands of texts with a single mouse click.

Opn Sesame has earned millions as a hub of text-messaging efforts for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee this election cycle, said a digital Republican strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of political retribution.

Facebook and Twitter cracked down on disinformation in the runup to the election, making text messaging and robocalls more attractive to those seeking to spread false and sometimes dangerous messages directly to voters via their phones.

“The extent to which these companies are relying upon loopholes in the law and a lack of regulation in this space has really staggered me,” said Sam Woolley, a misinformation and computational propaganda researcher at the University of Texas at Austin .

“They really want to circumvent the need to rely social media firms which is why they are using these private mechanisms,” he added. “They are using tech that we don’t think of as particularly new, texting, calling, but using them in ways that are very Machiavellian.”

Mr. Meadows, who routinely shrugged off the need to wear masks and embraced Mr. Trump’s strategy of playing down the threat from the coronavirus over the summer, informed a small group of White House advisers that he had tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, a senior administration official said late Friday.

Five other White House officials also tested positive for the virus in the days before and after Election Day, people familiar with the diagnoses told The New York Times. Bloomberg News also reported on additional cases around the president, who contracted the virus last month and spent three days in the hospital receiving experimental treatments.

With Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead in several battleground states as the vote count continues, the Trump campaign is filing lawsuits in at least four states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Starting early Wednesday, the campaign and the Republican National Committee have been sending dozens of daily text messages and emails saying they need financial support to challenge voting procedures.

Antrim County election results investigated after red Michigan county turns blue,0,jpfsaa,https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/04/michigan-antrim-county-election-results-trump-biden-blue/6162541002/,4,1604733421.0,,"CLOSE

LANSING — Officials are investigating wonky election results in Antrim County in northern Michigan that could add a few thousand votes to the tallies for President Donald Trump and Republican Senate candidate John James.

Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican who ran unopposed and won a third four-year term Tuesday in the strongly GOP county, said results on electronic tapes and a computer card were accurate but it appeared that some of the results were somehow scrambled after the cards were transported in sealed bags from township precincts to county offices and downloaded onto a computer.

In 2016, Trump won Antrim County with about 62% of the vote, compared with about 33% for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump beat Clinton by about 4,000 votes.

Wednesday morning, Antrim results showed Democrat Joe Biden leading Trump by slightly more than 3,000 votes, with 98% of precincts reporting.

Officials had not checked the results before posting them, but later asked: ""How could Democrats take over this county?"" Guy said Wednesday.

Now, officials are going over the tape of all the results and inputting the numbers manually, Guy said. They hoped to post updated numbers Wednesday night, she said.

""It takes us back to the '80s, is what it does,"" said Guy, who has worked for the county for more than 40 years, having served as a deputy clerk before running for the elected post.

Antrim uses Dominion voting equipment and does not use cellular modems to transmit results from precincts to county offices, Guy said. Instead, the data is transported by election officials. Guy said she is in talks with the company that maintains the election equipment but the apparent glitch could also be the result of unspecified ""human error.""

Tom McMillin, a former state lawmaker from Oakland County and a member of the State Board of Education, said he noticed irregularities with the Antrim County vote totals late Tuesday, when he was checking out returns for Board of Education candidates.

In some precincts, but not all, Biden and other Democratic candidates had far more votes than normal, McMillin said.

""It just looked weird,"" he said. ""Two-thirds of the townships looked really messed up.""

The apparent discrepancy was striking enough that it drew the attention of not just McMillin, but Michigan journalists and other political observers who drew attention to the Antrim numbers on social media.

McMillin said his calculations suggest Trump and James could each be in line for a net vote gain of 4,000 to 5,000 votes. Other candidates would also be affected, he said.

Fixed computer glitch turns losing Republican into a winner in Oakland County,27,jpfhuq,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2020/11/06/oakland-county-election-2020-race-results/6184186002/,5,1604732427.0,,"CLOSE

A computer error led election officials in Oakland County to hand an upset victory Wednesday to a Democrat, only to switch the win back to an incumbent Republican a day later.

In Oakland County’s 15th County Commission District — representing Rochester and Rochester Hills — the initial count gave a 104-vote margin to the Democrat, Melanie Hartman, amounting to a razor-thin majority of 50.08%.

That stunned the incumbent, Adam Kochenderfer, giving him a sure sense that he’d lost in a district long deemed a Republican stronghold.

“I thought that was that,” Kochenderfer said. “Those were the results, and I said I would not seek a recount.”

But what a difference a day makes — in weather, love, and the 15th District election for Oakland County commissioner. On Thursday, Kochenderfer was stunned again, this time by a call from Oakland County’s director of elections, flipping the outcome to him.

“Apparently, there was a technical glitch in Rochester Hills. And so I actually ended up winning by a little over 1,100 votes,” said a chuckling Kochenderfer.

The margin was 1,127 votes, to be exact. That gave him a 51.67% share of the total (with 48.23% going to his opponent, Hartman).

The fresh result buoyed the incumbent’s spirits but also had him worried about how to prevent future election errors, he said.

“I’m very grateful to the officials who caught the error, but we need to ensure that we catch these issues, or prevent them entirely,” Kochenderfer said.

""People are acting like fixing our elections is a partisan thing when it shouldn't be partisan,"" he said, adding, ""we do have a very, very good clerk in Rochester Hills.""

That clerk is Tina Barton, a Republican who lost in her race for Oakland County clerk while handling the local election in Rochester Hills. Barton could not be reached for comment Thursday night. But Oakland County Director of Elections Joe Rozell said the error stemmed from a computer issue at the Rochester Hills city clerk’s office.

“A computer issue in Rochester Hills caused them to send us results for seven precincts as both precinct votes and absentee votes. They should only have been sent to us as absentee votes,” Rozell said in a text message.

“We noticed the local clerk’s mistake (on Thursday) and corrected it. The county canvass process works, and the correct results are now on our website,” Rozell said.

And the process worked apparently without regard to politics. A Republican city clerk supervised a vote count that wrongly gave victory to a Democrat, after which a Democratic county clerk's staff caught the error and requested a correction from the Republican city clerk, handing the win to a Republican.

Record-breaking number of Native Americans elected to Congress - Four Native Americans won reelection and two newcomers were elected to the House.,230,jpdkpc,https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/diversity-inclusion/524694-record-breaking-number-of-native-americans,5,1604725951.0,,"A record-breaking number of Native Americans will serve in the U.S. House of Representatives following an election night that brought many historic firsts for diversity.

The 117th Congress will include six Native American House candidates after four won reelection and two Native American newcomers were elected in New Mexico and Hawaii.

America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.

One of the new members is Democrat Kaiali’i “Kai” Kahele, who won his race in Hawaii’s 2nd Congressional District against Republican Joe Akana. He’ll be the second Native Hawaiian to represent Hawaii in Congress since it became a state in 1959, according to Indian Country Today.

“Words cannot express my deep appreciation to everyone who has believed in our campaign, supported us, voted & donated! Our challenging work begins now, and I’ll do everything I can do to bring our state the resources we need to recover and build a resilient Hawai’i,” Kahele said following his victory.

In New Mexico, Republican Yvette Herrell, a member of the Cherokee nation, won her race in the 2nd Congressional District after a rematch with Democratic incumbent Xochitl Torres Small. The former state legislator successfully ousted the first-term Democrat in a rural district where President Trump is popular.

Meanwhile, the first two Native American women to ever be elected to Congress in 2018, Rep. Debra Haaland (D-N.M.) and Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kansas), both held onto their seats. Haaland is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, and also has Jemez Pueblo heritage. Davids, who is also one of the few openly gay congresswomen, is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation.

Incumbents Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) and Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) also won reelection. Cole is a member of the Chickasaw Nation and Mullin is Cherokee.

The election of both Haaland and Herrell helped New Mexico become the first state to ever elect all women of color to its House delegation.

The milestone comes as the 2020 election saw many historic firsts. Two New York Democrats became the first openly gay Black men to serve in Congress, while Delaware elected the first openly transgender state senator and Missouri elected its first Black congresswoman.

'Hard to believe this is real': Trump campaign urges Pennsylvania voters to mail late ballots,238,jpaj56,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/06/trump-campaign-asks-pennsylvania-supporters-mail-late-ballots/6186578002/,13,1604716283.0,,"CLOSE Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf says a lawsuit filed by President Trump's campaign to stop counting of ballots in the state is ""simply wrong."" (Nov. 4) AP Domestic

President Donald Trump's campaign in Wisconsin has desperately sought volunteers to call Pennsylvanians and urge them to mail in absentee ballots by Friday, which is after the Keystone State's deadline – even as the president himself rails against late votes and the ongoing vote count.

Only votes cast by Nov. 3 are legal according to Pennsylvania and federal election laws. Trump himself has described any effort to vote after Tuesday as clear election fraud.

As of early Friday, the count in Pennsylvania showed Democrat Joe Biden pulling ahead of Trump who held a large lead on election night before the majority of mailed-in ballots had been counted.

The Trump campaign is trying to take advantage of an effort by Pennsylvania to count all absentee votes mailed by Nov. 3 even if received up to three days later.

Under a federal court ruling upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, absentee ballots mailed before the deadline and received by 5 p.m. Friday can be counted.

That ruling said ballots received by that point without postmarks, or with illegible postmarks, will be considered to have been mailed in time ""unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day.""

Election results update: Biden on the verge of winning presidency with leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia

'Volunteers Urgently Needed'

An email obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel sent at 5:19 p.m. Thursday by Kenosha for Trump is headlined ""Volunteers Urgently Needed.""

It reads: ""Trump Victory urgently needs volunteers to make phone calls to Pennsylvania Trump supporters to return their absentee ballots. These phone calls will help President Trump win the election!""

Volunteers are urged to contact a pair of field directors listed in the email. The two, Riley Pella and Joshua Williams, are paid staffers for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, filings with the Federal Election Commission show.

Dozens of Republican staffers in Wisconsin were involved in the operation to recruit volunteers to contact Trump supporters in Pennsylvania, according to one person familiar with the effort.

Pella referred questions about the email to Anna Kelly, spokeswoman for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin.

Kelly did not return requests for an interview on Thursday night.

A solicitation to commit voter fraud?

""This seems deeply stupid as it seems to be a solicitation to commit voter fraud,"" said Richard Hasen, a noted elections law specialist at the University of California, Irvine Law School. ""It's hard to believe this is real.""

Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the email appeared to be a foolish attempt to try to highlight perceived problems and confusion created by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling.

""It is a fairly unimpressive scheme, if it is a scheme,"" said Levitt, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department under the Obama Administration.

Levitt said the email could be the basis for a criminal investigation under the section of federal civil rights laws that forbids ""conspiracies to encourage

illegal voting."" But he added it would be a tough case to prove, making most federal prosecutors reluctant to seek an indictment.

The defense, he said, could simply be that the writer of the email misunderstood what the Pennsylvania court did, and thought ballots mailed after Tuesday would still be counted. Levitt said that based on ""imprecise reporting"" about what Pennsylvania's high court actually ruled, that is a possible defense.

""If you think Pennsylvania really does have three extra days, this is not a crazy email to send,"" Levitt said. ""It is wrong and is unlawful ... but it does not have the hallmarks of a mastermind scheme.""

An effort to get the votes to count would appear to be a longshot – a Friday postmark would clearly be too late. But Fox News has reported that in Pennsylvania, postage is prepaid on some ballot envelopes. These prepaid envelopes are not automatically postmarked.

As such, if they were mailed on Thursday night or Friday and delivered before the deadline, it's conceivable some could be counted.

Supreme Court decision

The U.S. Supreme Court denied a Republican Party effort to block the three-day extension. But the court also ordered that ballots received after polls close on Tuesday to be segregated from those received earlier.

If the state turns out to be pivotal, the court indicated it may consider the state GOP's challenge after the election.

Benjamin Geffen, an attorney with the Public Interest Law Center in Philadelphia, said he doubted there are many — if any — Pennsylvania Trump supporters who hadn't sent absentee ballots in on time.

But if any existed and did get their ballots somehow counted improperly, Trump's campaign might point to that as an example of problems in the entire process, and use it to question the integrity of the larger count.

""If you're knowingly encouraging people to mail in ballots after the deadline, you're encouraging cheating,"" Geffen said. ""But maybe it's just to muddy the waters.""

He added: ""I don't know if it's what you could call first-degree misconduct, (trying to actually get invalid votes counted) or just second-degree misconduct, trying to create perception the process is riddled with fraud.""

Pennsylvania secretary of state: Too few late-arriving Pennsylvania ballots to affect final outcome of Trump-Biden race

Trump has slammed decision

Before the election, Trump had condemned the court's decision to leave the three-day extension in place, calling it ""a horrendous decision for our country.""

""I think it’s a decision that allows tremendous cheating to go on after the fact but before the votes are tabulated,"" Trump said Monday in Milwaukee just before heading to Kenosha for an election-eve rally.

He added, ""It’s a mistake. It allows cheating. It allows cheating at a very high level, and very easy cheating, too.""

The Trump campaign said Wednesday it was pursuing legal action to stop ballot counting in Michigan and Pennsylvania and to prevent the counting of absentee ballots in Georgia that it claims arrived after an Election Day deadline.

Trump on Thursday again spoke out against late-arriving ballots, insisting that they should not be counted.

"America’s anti-democratic Senate, by the numbers",2,jp93lm,https://www.vox.com/2020/11/6/21550979/senate-malapportionment-20-million-democrats-republicans-supreme-court,3,1604711820.0,,"Democrats defeated Republican senators in Arizona and Colorado this year, while Republicans gained a Senate seat in Alabama.

That means that Republicans will control at least 50 seats in the incoming Senate, out of 100 total, assuming Republican incumbents Sens. Thom Tillis (NC) and Dan Sullivan (AK) keep their seats, as seems likely. Both of Georgia’s Senate seats are likely to be decided in runoff elections in January.

Wins in North Carolina and Georgia would give Republicans the Senate majority — something they would hold only because Congress’s upper house is malapportioned to give small states like Wyoming exactly as many senators as large states like California, even though California has more than 68 times as many people as Wyoming.

In the incoming Senate, Democratic senators will represent at least 20,314,962 more people than their Republican counterparts — and that’s if we assume that Republicans win both runoff elections in Georgia. If the two Georgia seats go to the Democrats, the Senate will be split 50-50, but the Democratic half will represent 41,549,808 more people than the Republican half.

I derived these numbers using 2019 population estimates by the United States Census Bureau. In states where both senators caucus with the same party, I allocated the state’s entire population to that party. In states where the Senate delegation is split, I allocated half of the state’s population to each party. Although Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Angus King (I-ME) identify as independent, both Sanders and King caucus with Democrats. So I coded them as Democratic senators.

You can check my work using this spreadsheet.

One other fact is worth noting. In the current Senate, Democrats control a majority of the seats from the most populous half of the states (26-24). Republicans owe their current majority to a crushing 29-21 lead in the least populous half of the states. In the new Senate, Democrats will control between 27 and 29 seats from the most populous half, depending on who prevails in the Georgia runoffs.

Republicans, in other words, would not be in the majority now — and they certainly would not be in the majority next year — if not for malapportionment.

The implications of this malapportionment are breathtaking. Among other things, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett were all nominated by a president who lost the popular vote and confirmed by a bloc of senators who represent less than half of the country. If the United States chose its leaders in free and fair elections, none of these individuals would serve on the Supreme Court — and it is likely that Democratic appointees would have a majority on the Court.

Similarly, if Republicans control the Senate in 2021, the GOP will have the power to prevent Joe Biden from confirming a Cabinet, to block everyone Biden nominates to the federal bench, to prevent Biden from signing any legislation, and even to shut down the government.

This is not what the American people voted for in November. But it is what a deeply broken Constitution, which effectively gives extra Senate seats to white conservatives in small states, has given us."
Trump has told people he has no plans to concede even if his path to victory is blocked,289,jp6cse,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/06/politics/donald-trump-election-2020/index.html,54,1604702897.0,,"(CNN) Facing a disappearing pathway to victory , President Donald Trump offered little indication on Friday he was prepared to concede defeat, leading those around him to wonder who might be able to reckon with a leader who has given virtually no thought to leaving the White House.

So far he has been bolstered in his stance by those closest to him, including his senior advisers and his adult sons, who have mounted an aggressive effort in the courts to challenge the results and have pressured other Republicans into defending him.

Top aides, including his chief of staff Mark Meadows, have not attempted to come to terms with the President about the reality of what is happening. Instead, they have fed his baseless claim that the election is being stolen from underneath him. That has led to some annoyance among staff, who believe Meadows is feeding the President's baseless claim that the election is illegitimate.

Vice President Mike Pence -- who has not been seen since the early hours of Wednesday morning -- is doing his part to appease Trump by soliciting funds for his legal defense fund.

Trump is not scheduled to appear in public on Friday, though an appearance at some point has not been ruled out. He spent the morning angry and frustrated, watching television while griping more people weren't defending him on the airwaves.

In a written statement on Friday afternoon, Trump signaled his intentions to continue waging legal battle.

""This is no longer about any single election. This is about the integrity of our entire election process,"" he wrote. ""We will pursue this process through every aspect of the law to guarantee the American people have confidence in our government. I will never give up fighting for you and our nation.""

A source familiar with some of the legal discussions behind the scenes said the President is starting to tell advisers he may not be able to pull out a come-from-behind victory.

The source pointed to Trump's more modulated statement, that was drained of the bluster from Thursday night's performance in the briefing room.

But even as Trump has acknowledged to some allies he recognizes the electoral math will not work in his favor, according to people familiar with the conversations, he has maintained that a prolonged court battle and corrosive rhetoric about election fraud would sow enough doubt to allow him to refuse to accept the results.

Two campaign advisers and one source close to the President said Trump will exhaust his legal avenues for fighting the results in several key battleground states before giving any consideration to conceding.

""He's in fighting mode,"" one source close to the President said. ""He thinks it's in his benefit to fight.""

While the reality of Trump's impending loss has set in for many people close to the campaign, others are advising the President to continue fighting the outcomes and investigate claims of fraud.

Biden's campaign voiced little concern at the prospect of Trump clinging to power.

""As we said on July 19, the American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House,"" campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.

The Trump campaign released a statement Friday morning making clear it will refuse to concede the election, calling any projections of Biden as the winner ""false"" and the race ""far from final.""

""This election is not over,"" Trump campaign general counsel Matt Morgan said in a statement.

Still, some of the President's allies have grown concerned that someone will eventually have to reckon with him that his time in office is likely coming to an end. It is a possibility the President did not consider in a serious way during the election, despite polls showing him with only a narrow path to victory, believing that looking past Election Day was bad luck.

The delicate matter of a loss -- and a potential post-presidential life -- was not discussed widely among his team and was not raised often with the President, who believed adamantly he would win.

Trump spent much of the campaign claiming Biden was the worst presidential candidate in history -- and suggesting that losing to him would amount to abject humiliation.

""Losing is never easy,"" he said at his campaign headquarters on Election Day. ""Not for me, it's not.""

Now, people around Trump are working to identify who might be able to communicate to him the stark reality. There has been talk of potentially Jared Kushner or Ivanka Trump, though their willingness to lead a difficult intervention wasn't clear.

One idea being floated is framing potential conversations with Trump around the idea of preserving his brand for life after being president -- and explaining that dragging out an election he clearly lost would ruin his businesses and forestall whatever political future he's hoping for.

Before the election, Trump raised the prospect of running for President again in 2024 if he were to lose, though only in a joking manner. Even in likely loss, Trump garnered more votes than he did in 2016 and his future role as a Republican kingmaker seems secured -- though some fear a drawn out and ugly loss could damage his standing.

Trump has spent the days since election night ensconced at the White House, angrily phoning allies and demanding that more people come out to defend him. He has complained that his legal team is ill-prepared to wage an effective battle in courts, according to one person who spoke to him.

At the same time, his legal team's efforts have appeared somewhat slipshod. Some in the campaign questioned the Trump team's decision to dispatch the likes of Rudy Giuliani and Trump's sons to make unfounded allegations of voter fraud, arguing they likely diminished the President's claims of wrongdoing.

Trump sounded downtrodden during an evening statement from the White House on Thursday and departed the room without answering for his false claims about voter fraud.

In meetings with his team in the Oval Office and the White House residence, Trump has asked why more Republicans weren't coming out to allege voter irregularities or make the same claims he was making about votes being counted after Election Day.

He also pressed them into arranging a public statement, something he'd been itching to do since Wednesday. Aides had successfully stalled, believing anything the President said would damage his standing and make matters worse.

But after Biden spoke from near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday afternoon, Trump insisted a statement be added for him to detail his legal case.

Afterward, several advisers said the performance was precisely what they'd hoped to avoid."

Biden surpassed 270 electoral votes by flipping the battleground state of Pennsylvania, and he also won Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia.

The president-elect enjoyed a steady, but ultimately overstated, lead over Trump in polls in critical states in the weeks before the election.

The Democratic nominee Joe Biden was projected to win the 2020 presidential election early Friday, as voters rejected President Donald Trump's chaotic and deeply polarizing first term.

Biden surpassed the 270 electoral votes required to win the White House by flipping the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, according to projections by Decision Desk HQ.

His vice presidential running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, made history by becoming the nation's first female, Black, and Indian American vice president.

Decision Desk HQ and Insider made the call at 8:50 a.m. ET on Friday, November 6. The AP, NBC, CNN, The New York Times, the Washington Post, and BBC called the election for Biden shortly after 11 a.m. ET on Saturday.

In a speech on Friday evening at his campaign HQ in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden did not declare victory but said he was confident in winning once more votes had been tallied.

In the days after being projected the winner, Biden also picked up Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, while Trump won North Carolina. The final projected electoral vote count stands at 306 for Biden and 232 for Trump.

Biden had nearly 6 million more votes than Trump as of November 16, a lead that's likely to grow as states finalize their results in the coming days and weeks.

With Biden's victory, Trump becomes the 13th president to lose reelection and just the fourth to do so since the end of World War II.

Biden had led Trump in national and state polling for months, and though he ultimately won the race, polls in critical states significantly overstated his lead. Biden's win came after two full days of ballot counting, which was delayed in many states because of a surge in mail-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic.

The 77-year-old former vice president addressed the nation while the counts were underway, expressing confidence in the outcome of the race and insisting that all votes should and would be counted.

At the same time, Trump and his allies falsely claimed that he had won the election.

The Trump campaign filed lawsuits in Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania in an effort to halt the states' vote counts, and it called for a recount in Wisconsin. While a candidate has the legal right to request a recount, Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally demand that legally cast ballots be discounted.

Biden's election is a rebuke of Trump's presidency, which for the past nine months has been marred by the administration's response to a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 Americans and resulted in an economic crisis. Biden's win also happened against the backdrop of Trump's attacks on the integrity of the election process, none of which have been supported by evidence or empirical data.

Biden ran as an elder statesman with moderate politics who could stabilize a country reeling from several crises and rebuild the US's relationships with foreign allies.

Despite facing a crowded and diverse field of competitors, Biden dominated the Democratic primary, buoyed by crucial support from Black voters. Most of Biden's primary opponents, including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, poured significant energy into supporting Biden's bid, and some are expected to become part of his Cabinet and administration.

But the incoming administration's policy efforts could be hindered by the Senate, control of which remained unclear on Friday.

Historic turnout

This year, because of the coronavirus pandemic, more Americans voted by mail or early in person than at any other time in US history. According to the US Elections Project, over 101 million Americans voted early, surpassing two-thirds of the total vote count in 2016.

There were 10 key battleground states in this year's election: Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, Texas, and Arizona. Of those, seven allowed election officials to start counting or processing mail ballots before Election Day: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, North Carolina, and Texas.

As Business Insider has reported, there was a significant partisan gap in how Americans chose to vote. Trump had for months cast doubt on the integrity of voting by mail and baselessly claimed that it would lead to widespread voter fraud and a ""rigged"" election outcome. Partly for that reason, early votes were expected to skew heavily in favor of Biden, while ballots cast in person on Election Day were expected to favor Trump.

Experts were also bracing for a ""red shift"" or a ""blue shift"" depending on when states began counting which ballots. States that started processing early votes and mail-in votes before reporting results from ballots cast on Election Day were expected to show Biden leading and, later, a shift toward Trump. Conversely, states that started counting Election Day votes could have seen Trump ahead and then a shift toward Biden as they processed mail-in ballots and early votes.

Trump's campaign was hobbled by his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 9 million Americans, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. For months, polling suggested that fewer than 40% of Americans approved of Trump's response to the pandemic. And recent polling found Trump's approval rating on economic issues dropping in key swing states.

Trump's legacy

The Trump administration presided over a period of rancor and division within American politics not seen in the past several decades. This year alone the US endured a blistering recession, a pandemic, rolling national lockdowns, civil unrest stemming from high-profile police brutality, and violent confrontations in major American cities involving heavily armed police officers and protesters. These incidents defined Trump's last year in office in a personal way, extending from his use of tear gas on peaceful protesters outside the White House to his own diagnosis with COVID-19.

Trump's style of governance can be traced to the beginning of his campaign, which he kicked off by smearing Mexicans as criminals and rapists. His brash style appealed to many in the Republican base, and his 2016 campaign was headlined by large-scale popular rallies where thousands of his fans would gather, often televised to millions more. Trump's atypical style — coupled with strategic deficiencies in Hillary Clinton's Democratic campaign and coinciding with a push by Russia to meddle in Trump's favor — propelled him to a surprise victory.

From the moment he took the office, Trump applied the powers of the presidency to the goals of his constituency and his new coalition, though at times it led to significant legal troubles and difficulties contending with his own government.

A controversial executive order banning US travel to citizens from numerous majority-Muslim nations was immediately mired in litigation, and led to Trump sacking the acting attorney general when she refused to enforce it. Trump would, over the course of his first two years in office, put the existing instruments of the immigration administrative state to new uses, with targeted campaigns against those in the country without authorization and those pursuing entry.

Trump's hardline immigration stance culminated in a widely reviled ""zero tolerance"" policy that separated migrant children who entered the country from their legal guardian ahead of incarceration. Mass public pressure and litigation eventually led the administration to relent, though hundreds of children remain separated from their parents to this day.

Protests and civil unrest defined Trump's time in office, with staunch opposition to his policies not just from elected Democrats but also large social movements that formed as a resistance to his presidency. The Women's March that took place across the country the day after his inauguration catalyzed years of mass protest to his time in office.

The Trump presidency also accelerated the rise of the far right and white supremacy in the US, most notably at a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that featured scores of Trump supporters waving Confederate flags and chanting KKK slogans, and led to the death of a counterprotester, Heather Heyer.

The civil unrest seen in the US under the Trump administration had been a repeated source of consternation and, at times, use for the president. His inability to fully disavow passionate but violent supporters has been a consistent theme over his time in office.

Trump's presidency was also marred by a bitter impeachment process and a years-long FBI investigation into whether his campaign knowingly conspired with the Russian government to tilt the 2016 race in his favor. The Republican-controlled Senate ultimately acquitted Trump following an impeachment trial, and the president was not charged in the Russia investigation, partly because of a long-standing Justice Department policy that says a sitting president cannot be indicted.

But several of his highest-ranking associates — including his former national security advisor Michael Flynn, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, his former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, and the informal GOP advisor Roger Stone — pleaded guilty to or were convicted of felonies.

Though his impeachment acquittal may have been an hour of triumph for the Trump administration, it would soon be followed by the biggest crisis of Trump's presidency. In late 2019, researchers first observed a respiratory virus in the vicinity of Wuhan, China. The virus began spreading in China over the next few months, and US officials repeatedly warned the president that it would soon gain a foothold in the US and that the administration needed to take early action to prepare for a pandemic.

Trump's administration failed to develop a robust response, and by March the virus arrived in the US. Soon after, the US became the global epicenter of the outbreak, even as other countries took steps to significantly reduce the spread of the virus.

Trump did achieve numerous substantial, enduring wins for his party and his constituents, particularly in terms of a tax cut as well as filling a large number of judicial vacancies across the federal judiciary, a long-held priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

The most enduring achievement of the Trump presidency for his base may be the three Supreme Court justices he had confirmed to the bench, a legacy-defining tectonic shift in power in the interpretation of American law.

Yet the president's inability to soothe the country amid widespread unrest as well as his administration's failure to respond to the most pressing public-health crisis of our time — and the ensuing economic distress — set the defining tone of Trump's reelection bid."
Fact check: Trump delivers most dishonest speech of his presidency as Biden closes in on victory,173,jp5zov,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/05/politics/fact-check-trump-speech-thursday-election-rigged-stolen/index.html,6,1604701604.0,,"I've watched or read the transcript of every Trump speech since late 2016. I've cataloged thousands and thousands of his false claims.

I have never seen him lie more thoroughly and more egregiously than he did on Thursday evening at the White House.

On the verge of what appeared to be a likely defeat by former Vice President Joe Biden , Trump emerged in the press briefing room and took a blowtorch to the presidential tradition of defending the legitimacy of the democratic process.

Aside from some valid criticism of errors by pollsters, some legitimate boasting about his performance with various demographic groups and some legitimate boasting about Republicans' down-ballot performance, almost everything Trump said was not true.

Here's a rundown:

Election theft?

Trump alleged that unnamed opponents of his are ""trying to steal an election"" and ""trying to rig an election.""

Facts First: This is entirely baseless. This election is legitimate. Trump's opponents are not trying to steal it. Election officials are simply counting legally cast votes.

Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia

Trump claimed that he ""won"" the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia, citing his substantial early leads in the vote counts there.

Facts First: This is false. Holding a lead before all of the votes are counted is, obviously, not the same as having won -- and Trump has lost Wisconsin and Michigan, according to CNN projections. At the time of his speech, he was also in trouble in Pennsylvania as votes from Democratic-leaning areas were counted, and his margin in Georgia was shrinking fast as the count continued.

Mail-in voting

Trump called mail-in voting ""a corrupt system,"" adding later that there is ""tremendous corruption and fraud going on.""

Facts First: This is also just wrong. Fraud is : This is also just wrong. Fraud is exceedingly rare with mail-in voting; though it does happen on occasion, there is no basis on which to call the entire system corrupt.

The legitimacy of the count, part 1

Trump began the speech by saying, ""If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.""

Facts First: This is, again, just false. Trump was on the verge of defeat because legal votes continued to be counted. There was no basis for his suggestion that ""illegal votes"" were being counted, certainly not that such votes were the reason he was in electoral trouble.

The legitimacy of the count, part 2

Trump claimed, ""We were winning in all of the key locations by a lot, actually, and our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away. ..."" He added, ""They want to find out how many votes they need and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait and then they find them. ...""

Facts First: There is no basis for Trump's suggestion that something nefarious had caused some of his leads to shrink or that anybody was nefariously manipulating the vote counts. His leads had shrunk in some states because entirely legitimate mail-in ballots were being counted. Because many more Democrats than Republicans chose to vote by mail, the order of the counts in these states caused Trump to lose ground in the vote totals over time.

In other states like Florida, where mail-in ballots were counted earlier than in-person votes, Trump actually gained ground in the totals over time -- as he has in Arizona, which remained too close to call at the time of his speech.

The legitimacy of the count, part 3

Trump claimed, ""In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on election night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name Biden on them, or just about all, I think almost all. They all had the name Biden on them, which is a little strange.""

Facts First: Trump's innuendo is baseless. Different states counted their ballots at different speeds, but there is no basis to claim that results were suspiciously ""withheld"" -- some counties and states always take a while to count and to report -- or that there was something suspicious about Biden's dominance in the late stages of the count in some states. Again, Biden's gains were a result of legitimate mail-in ballots being counted.

It's not true that ""all"" or ""almost all"" mail ballots being counted on Wednesday or Thursday were for Biden. Biden handily led Trump in these batches of ballots, but Trump was getting tens of thousands of votes from mail voters in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan, too.

The legitimacy of the count, part 4

Trump said, ""It's amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided.""

Facts First: There is nothing suspicious about the fact that far more Biden voters than Trump voters chose to vote by mail: Biden encouraged his supporters to do so, while Trump relentlessly disparaged mail-in voting as fraud-prone and unsafe.

Trump made some brief exceptions during the campaign, saying at one point that mail voting in Florida was safe and secure, but his dominant message to his voters was that they should vote in person.

Democrats and the count

Trump said, ""There are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus of those states are run in all cases by Democrats."" He later added that ""the election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.""

Facts First: This is false. Georgia's top elections official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, is a Republican. So is Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske of Nevada, a state where the race was also close at the time.

There is also no basis to suggest that the Democratic election officials in other states have done anything wrong. And it is local counties that actually count the votes.

Votes and Election Day?

Trump declared that ""no illegal votes"" should be allowed to be cast after Election Day, suggesting that such illegal voting was happening.

Facts First: Votes are not being cast after Election Day; votes are being counted after Election Day, as always. And some states accept mail ballots received after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before Election Day.

""Unsolicited"" ballots

Trump claimed that states had sent out tens of millions of ""unsolicited"" ballots ""without any verification measures whatsoever."" He was referring to states that mailed a ballot to each eligible registered voter without requiring a specific request.

Facts First: This is a familiar Trump claim, and it remains wrong. The nine states (plus Washington, DC) that : This is a familiar Trump claim, and it remains wrong. The nine states (plus Washington, DC) that sent out such ballots have various ballot security measures in place, such as signature-match requirements, to ensure the correct people are voting. It's worth noting that one of the states that sends out ""unsolicited"" ballots is Republican-run Utah , which Trump is projected to carry for the second consecutive election.

Detroit and Philadelphia

Trump claimed, ""Detroit and Philadelphia, known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country, easily, cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race, a very important presidential race.""

Facts First: There was no basis for Trump's suggestion that Detroit and Philadelphia had done anything wrong in this election, much less that they were ""engineering the outcome."" Their local counties were simply counting votes, like every other local county.

Election observers in Detroit

Trump claimed, ""Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit.""

Facts First: This is false. CNN r : This is false. CNN r eporter Annie Grayer said she has observed representatives of the Trump campaign roaming for three days at the TFC Center, where the counting of Detroit's mail ballots is taking place. And on Monday, the first day of the counting of these ballots, Grayer took a photo of Republican poll challengers checking in at the facility.

Detroit's corporation counsel (principal attorney), Lawrence Garcia, said there were approximately 225 Republican poll challengers in the facility on Wednesday, along with 256 Democrats and 76 independents, Grayer reported

Grayer said she has seen two people get kicked out, one a Republican who refused to wear a mask over their nose and one of undetermined affiliation for causing a disturbance while wearing a Halloween mask. But that's not the same as no Trump observers being allowed at all.

Covered windows

Trump claimed, ""One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows again with large pieces of cardboard and so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn't want anybody seeing the counting, though these were observers, legal observers that were supposed to be there.""

Facts First: This is misleading: Republican poll challengers were already inside the facility in Detroit when some windows were covered on Wednesday after additional Republicans arrived on scene.

Garcia said in a statement: ""Some -- but not all -- windows were covered, because poll workers seated just inside those windows expressed concerns about people outside the center photographing and filming them and their work. Only the media is allowed to take pictures inside the counting place, and people outside the center were not listening to requests to stop filming poll workers and their paperwork. Hundreds of challengers from both parties were inside the central counting board all afternoon and all evening; dozens of reporters were in the room too. At all times, people outside the center could see in through windows that were further away from counting board work spaces.""

A pipe bursting in Georgia

Trump claimed, ""In Georgia, a pipe burst in a faraway location totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours.""

Facts First: It's not true that the burst-pipe issue in Atlanta happened in a location unrelated to the vote count. The pipe burst in a room at State Farm Arena that local officials : It's not true that the burst-pipe issue in Atlanta happened in a location unrelated to the vote count. The pipe burst in a room at State Farm Arena that local officials said was above the processing room for Fulton County absentee ballots.

The issue did cause a four-hour delay. No ballots were damaged, officials said.

The legitimacy of polls

Trump delivered some legitimate criticism of the inaccuracy of many polls. But then he said that ""the pollsters got it knowingly wrong,"" saying they were attempting the ""suppression"" of his supporters.

Facts First: This is baseless. Trump was correct that some polls were way off, but there is no evidence that pollsters were trying to be wrong -- at considerable public embarrassment to themselves.

The status of the Senate

Trump said, ""We kept the Senate despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats.""

Facts First: It was unclear at the time whether Republicans would keep the Senate -- in part because one race in Georgia was heading for a January runoff election and other Georgia race appeared likely to be going to a runoff as well. (Some additional Senate races in other states, in which Republicans held leads, had also not yet been called by media outlets.)"
"Biden moves into lead in Georgia, inches closer to White House",445,jp4qbx,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/biden-moves-into-lead-in-georgia-inches-closer-to-white-house-idUSKBN27M0UA,44,1604696774.0,,"WILMINGTON, Del./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to winning the White House on Friday, expanding his narrow leads over President Donald Trump in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Georgia even as Republicans sought to raise $60 million to fund lawsuits challenging the results.

Trump remained defiant, vowing to press unfounded claims of fraud as a weary, anxious nation waited for clarity in an election that only intensified the country’s deep polarization.

On the fourth day of vote counting, former Vice President Biden had a 253 to 214 lead in the state-by-state Electoral College vote that determines the winner, according to Edison Research.

Securing Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes would put Biden over the 270 he needs to win the presidency after a political career stretching back nearly five decades.

Biden would also win if he prevails in two of the three other key states where he was narrowly ahead on Friday: Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Like Pennsylvania, all three were still processing ballots on Friday.

Nationwide, Biden led Trump by 4.1 million votes out of a record 147 million cast.

However, his lead was much smaller in those four contested states: just 79,910 votes out of more than 16 million cast. In Georgia, he led by a mere 4,278 votes.

As Biden’s lead grew in Pennsylvania, hundreds of Democrats gathered outside Philadelphia’s downtown vote-counting site, wearing yellow shirts reading “Count Every Vote.” In Detroit, a crowd of Trump supporters, some armed, protested outside a counting location, waving flags and chanting, “Fight!”

Biden planned to deliver a prime-time address on Friday, according to two people familiar with his schedule. His campaign expected that could be a victory speech if television networks call the race for him in the coming hours.

Meanwhile, Trump showed no sign he was ready to concede, as his campaign pursued a series of lawsuits that legal experts said were unlikely to alter the election outcome.

“From the beginning we have said that all legal ballots must be counted and all illegal ballots should not be counted, yet we have met resistance to this basic principle by Democrats at every turn,” he said in a statement released by his campaign.

Trump earlier leveled an extraordinary attack on the democratic process, appearing at the White House on Thursday evening to falsely claim the election was being “stolen” from him. Election officials across the nation have said they are unaware of any significant irregularities.

Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress said he should tone down his rhetoric.

The Republican National Committee is looking to collect at least $60 million from donors to fund Trump’s legal challenges, two sources familiar with the matter said.

In both Pennsylvania and Georgia, Biden overtook Trump as officials processed thousands of mail-in ballots that were cast in urban Democratic strongholds including Philadelphia and Atlanta.

The number of Americans voting early and by mail this year surged due to the coronavirus as people tried to avoid large groups of voters on Election Day. The methodical counting process has left Americans waiting longer than they have since the 2000 election to learn the winner of a presidential contest.

A sense of grim resignation settled in at the White House on Friday, where the president was monitoring TV and talking to advisers on the phone. One adviser said it was clear the race was tilting against Trump, but that Trump was not ready to admit defeat.

The campaign’s general counsel, Matt Morgan, asserted in a statement on Friday that the elections in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania all suffered from improprieties and that Trump would eventually prevail in Arizona.

He also said the campaign expected to pursue a recount in Georgia, as it has said it will do in Wisconsin, where Biden won by more than 20,000 votes. A margin that wide has never been overturned by a recount, according to Edison Research.

Georgia officials said on Friday they expect a recount, which can be requested by a candidate if the final margin is less than 0.5%, as it currently is. Biden led by 0.1% as of Friday afternoon.

In response to the idea that Trump might not concede, Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement on Friday, “The United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”

BIDEN MOMENTUM

The messy aftermath capped a vitriolic campaign that underscored the country’s enduring racial, economic and cultural divides, amid a pandemic that has killed more than 235,000 Americans.

If he wins Biden might face a difficult task governing in a divided Washington.

Republicans could keep control of the U.S. Senate, which would enable them to block much of his agenda, including expanding healthcare and fighting climate change.

In Pennsylvania, Biden moved ahead of Trump for the first time and had a lead of 14,541 votes, while in Georgia, he was 4,278 votes ahead. Both margins were expected to grow as additional ballots were tallied. Pennsylvania officials estimated on Friday they had 40,000 ballots left to count, while Georgia officials said on Friday morning there were around 4,000 regular ballots remaining.

Biden, 77, would be the first Democrat to win Georgia since fellow Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992.

In Arizona, where officials said at least 142,000 uncounted ballots remained, Biden’s lead was at 40,954 votes. His margin in Nevada, where there were 63,000 mail-in ballots left to count, jumped to 20,137.

Pennsylvania, one of three traditionally Democratic states that handed Trump his 2016 victory, had long been seen as crucial to the 2020 race, and both candidates lavished enormous sums of money and time on the “Rust Belt” state.

While many rural areas in Pennsylvania remain in favor of Trump, Democrats are strong in big cities such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

States have historically taken time after Election Day to tally all votes, although in most presidential elections the gap between candidates is big enough that television networks project the winner and the losing candidate concedes before counting formally ends."
Twitter permanently suspends Steve Bannon account after talk of beheading,48,jp1czo,https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/05/tech/steve-bannon-twitter-permanent-suspension/index.html,10,1604679133.0,,"(CNN Business) Twitter permanently suspended an account belonging to former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon after he suggested Thursday morning that Dr. Anthony Fauci and FBI Director Christopher Wray should be beheaded. His comments were made in a video posted to his Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter accounts.

Bannon falsely claimed President Trump had won reelection, despite several key states still being too close to call, and said that he should fire both Fauci and Wray.

He then said he would go further: ""I'd put the heads on pikes. Right. I'd put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats. You either get with the program or you are gone.""

On Friday, a high-powered attorney representing Bannon in a criminal fraud case , moved to withdraw from representing him and asked that hearing scheduled for Monday in the case be postponed while Bannon looks for a new lawyer.

The lawyer, William Burck, a highly-regarded Republican attorney who served in the George W Bush administration, had represented Bannon during former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference into the 2016 presidential election.

Bannon retained Burck after he and three others were indicted over the summer and charged with defrauding investors in a crowd-funding effort called ""We Build The Wall"" to raise money for a border wall. They have pleaded not guilty.

The inflammatory comments came during a livestream of Bannon's ""War Room: Pandemic"" online show.

The video was live on Bannon's Facebook page for about 10 hours Thursday and had been viewed almost 200,000 times before Facebook removed it, citing its violence and incitement policies. CNN has reached out to Bannon for comment.

Earlier Thursday evening YouTube removed the video for violating its policy against ""inciting violence."" Twitter said it had permanently suspended the account of Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast for glorifying violence.

Bannon was also banned on Thursday from Mailchimp, an email newsletter platform that Bannon's podcast used to reach supporters.

The move could further limit Bannon's ability to promote his messages.

""We can confirm we've identified this account and closed it for violations of our Terms,"" Mailchimp tweeted after social media users noticed the business relationship.

Bannon's comments came as other supporters of President Trump also used violent and militaristic rhetoric to back Trump's baseless claims of a rigged election and to condemn his perceived political opponents.

In a tweet Thursday , Donald Trump Jr. called for his father ""to go to total war over this election.""

""It's time to clean up this mess & stop looking like a banana republic!"" he added.

Trump Jr. also repeated multiple baseless claims undermining the integrity of the election in the tweet, which was labeled by Twitter as ""disputed and might be misleading.""

During the campaign, he had touted baseless rigged-election claims to recruit an ""army"" for his dad, as CNN has previously reported

CNN has reached out to a spokesperson for Trump Jr. for comment.

Earlier on Thursday, Facebook shut down a pro-Trump group called ""Stop The Steal,"" which amassed hundreds of thousands of members and had been coordinating protests that sought to challenge the election's legitimacy.

Some members of the group posted about civil war and revolting against the government should Trump lose the election, according to a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a London-based think tank that monitors extremism.

""So IF they give this to Joe, how do we go about over throwing [sic] the government?"" one member of the group asked in a post.

Ciaran O'Connor, an analyst with ISD, said that, although such posts may be hyperbolic, Facebook groups can be used to coordinate offline protests or events that could turn violent.

""It was possible for this group to become a hub for potentially violent behavior,"" O'Connor said.

One of the administrators of the ""Stop the Steal"" group, Dustin Stockton, told CNN he did not see any messages within the group ""calling for violence outside of what is common political hyperbole."" He said Facebook's removal of the page was ""out of line and they should restore it immediately.""

A Facebook spokesperson told CNN, ""In line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group 'Stop the Steal,' which was creating real-world events.""

The spokesperson added, ""The group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group.""

Researchers say the controversy over the vote count is particularly fertile soil for extremists to spread their messages.

""A contested election creates the perfect conditions for extremists to create chaos, to sow division, and to try to undermine our democratic institutions,"" said Oren Segal, a vice president of the ADL's Center on Extremism. ""All those are foundational goals for extremist movements across the board.""

Even if comments from political influencers do not directly call for violence, war-like symbols and veiled references can valorize violence and potentially inspire people to action, said Cynthia Miller-Idriss, director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University.

She said President Trump's comments at his first debate with Biden, in which he told the far-right group the Proud Boys to ""stand back and stand by,"" for instance, could have been perceived as a call to action, regardless of his intent.

U.S. voters went to the polls starkly divided on how they see President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. But in places where the virus is most rampant now, Trump enjoyed enormous support.

An Associated Press analysis reveals that in 376 counties with the highest number of new cases per capita, the overwhelming majority — 93% of those counties — went for Trump, a rate above other less severely hit areas.

Most were rural counties in Montana, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Wisconsin — the kinds of areas that often have lower rates of adherence to social distancing, mask-wearing and other public health measures, and have been a focal point for much of the latest surge in cases.

Taking note of the contrast, state health officials are pausing for a moment of introspection. Even as they worry about rising numbers of hospitalizations and deaths, they hope to reframe their messages and aim for a reset on public sentiment now that the election is over.

“Public health officials need to step back, listen to and understand the people who aren’t taking the same stance” on mask-wearing and other control measures, said Dr. Marcus Plescia of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

“I think there’s the potential for things to get less charged and divisive,” he said, adding that there’s a chance a retooled public health message might unify Americans around lowering case counts so hospitals won’t get swamped during the winter months.

The electoral divide comes amid an explosion in cases and hospitalizations in the U.S. and globally.

The U.S. broke another record in the 7-day rolling average for daily new cases, hitting nearly 90,000. The tally for new cases Thursday was on track for another day above 100,000, with massive numbers reported all around the country, including a combined nearly 25,000 in Texas, Illinois and Florida. Iowa and Indiana each reported more than 4,000 cases as well.

The AP’s analysis was limited to counties in which at least 95% of precincts had reported results, and grouped counties into six categories based on the rates of COVID-19 cases they’d experienced per 100,000 residents.

Polling, too, shows voters who split on Republican Trump vs. Democrat Joe Biden differed on whether the pandemic is under control.

Thirty-six percent of Trump voters described the pandemic as completely or mostly under control, and another 47% said it was somewhat under control, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 110,000 voters conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago. Meanwhile, 82% of Biden voters said the pandemic is not at all under control.

The pandemic was considered at least somewhat under control by slim majorities of voters in many red states, including Alabama (60%), Missouri (54%), Mississippi (58%), Kentucky (55%), Texas (55%), Tennessee (56%) and South Carolina (56%).

In Wisconsin, where the virus surged just before the election, 57% said the pandemic was not under control. In Washington state, where the virus is more in control now compared to earlier in the year, 55% said the same. Voters in New York and New Hampshire, where the virus is more controlled now after early surges, were roughly divided in their assessments, similar to voters nationwide.

Trump voters interviewed by AP reporters said they value individual freedom and believed the president was doing as well as anyone could in response to the coronavirus.

Michaela Lane, a 25-year-old Republican, dropped her ballot off last week at a polling site at an outdoor mall in Phoenix. She cast her vote for Trump.

“I feel like the most important issue facing the country as a whole is liberty at large,” Lane said. “Infringing on people’s freedom, government overrule, government overreach, chaos in a lot of issues currently going on and just giving people back their rights.”

About half of Trump voters called the economy and jobs the top issue facing the nation, roughly twice the percentage who named the pandemic, according to VoteCast. By contrast, a majority of Biden voters — about 6 in 10 — said the pandemic was the most important issue.

In Madison, Wisconsin, Eric Engstrom, a 31-year-old investment analyst and his wife, Gwen, voted absentee by mail in early October.

Trump’s failure to control the pandemic sealed his vote for Biden, Engstrom said, calling the coronavirus the most immediate threat the nation faces. He and his wife are expecting their first child, a girl, in January and fear “the potential of one of us or both of us being sick when the baby is born,” he said.

Engstrom called Trump’s response to the virus abysmal. “If there was any chance that I was going to vote for Trump, it was eliminated because of the pandemic,” he said.

The political temperature has added to the stress of public health officials, Plescia said. “Our biggest concern is how long can they sustain this pace?” he said.

Since the start of the pandemic, 74 state and local public health officials in 31 states have resigned, retired or been fired, according to an ongoing analysis by AP and Kaiser Health News.

As the election mood dissipates, rising hospitalizations amid colder weather create “a really pivotal moment” in the pandemic, said Sema Sgaier, executive director of the Surgo Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that worked with Harvard University-affiliated Ariadne Labs to develop a tool for estimating vaccine needs in states.

“We really need to get our act together. When I say ‘we’ I mean collectively,” Sgaier said. Finding common ground may become easier if one of more of the vaccine candidates proves safe and effective and gains government approval, she said.

“The vaccine provides the reset button,” Sgaier said.

Dr. Anthony Fauci may be another unifying force. According to VoteCast, 73% of voters nationwide approve of the way Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been handling the pandemic.

Even among Trump voters, 53% approve of Fauci’s performance. About 9 in 10 Biden voters approve.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Sweden’s prime minister has gone into protective self-isolation after a person close to him came into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, as Sweden experiences a fall surge of coronavirus infections.

Stefan Lofven broke the news on Facebook on Thursday, when the Scandinavian country passed the threshold of 6,000 overall coronavirus deaths.

“The developments are going in the wrong direction fast. More are infected. More die. This is a serious situation,” he wrote.

“On the doctor’s advice, my wife Ulla and I will stay isolated for the time being,” Lofven wrote. “We are fine and have no symptoms. In accordance with recommendations from health officials, we will take a coronavirus test as soon as possible.”

“This is the only responsible thing to do in this situation,” he added, saying the person close to him had been in contact with another person who had tested positive.

Earlier this year, when European nations locked down to fight the virus, Sweden drew worldwide attention by keeping schools, gyms and restaurants open and not requiring people to wear masks. But now that daily new infections are on the rise again, Swedes may not have had much practice in making sacrifices for the national good.

In recent weeks, the government has ruled that a maximum of eight people can be seated at a restaurant together. It has also rolled out local restrictions — urging people to avoid crowded places, avoid public transportation and work from home if possible — that now affect seven in 10 Swedes.

“The Swedish population must understand that what happens in Europe, can, of course, also happen here. We see an increase (in new cases) that we must deal with,” Health Minister Lena Hallgren said. “Now what is important is to understand what the purpose is ... which is to stop a pandemic.”

At first, the Nordic country of 10 million people had some of the lowest numbers of new coronavirus cases. However, the latest figures tell a different story.

For the week beginning Oct. 19, Sweden reported 9,165 new infections, an increase of 63% compared to the previous week and the highest number of cases seen so far in one week, according to Sweden’s Public Health Agency.

Overall, Sweden reported another 4,034 infections Thursday, and 141,764 in total, and five more deaths that brought the overall toll to 6,002.

In comparison, neighboring Denmark has had 50,530 cases and 729 deaths and Norway, which shares a more than 1,600-kilometer (994-mile) border with Sweden, has recorded 21,954 cases and only 282 deaths.

As to the two-week cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000, Sweden has 293, Denmark 233 and Norway 97.3. The corresponding number of deaths is 0.7 in Sweden and Denmark, and 0.1 in Norway.

Experts say all reported numbers understate the true toll of the pandemic, due to missed cases, limited testing and other factors.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s campaign filed lawsuits Wednesday in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, laying the groundwork for contesting battleground states as he slipped behind Democrat Joe Biden in the hunt for the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.

The new filings, joining existing Republican legal challenges in Pennsylvania and Nevada, demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted, and raise absentee ballot concerns, the campaign said. However, at one Michigan location in question The Associated Press observed poll watchers from both sides monitoring on Wednesday.

The AP called Michigan for Democrat Joe Biden on Wednesday. Nevada, Pennsylvania and Georgia are undecided.

The Trump campaign also is seeking to intervene in a Pennsylvania case at the Supreme Court that deals with whether ballots received up to three days after the election can be counted, deputy campaign manager Justin Clark said.

The actions reveal an emerging legal strategy that the president had signaled for weeks, namely that he would attack the integrity of the voting process in states where the result could mean his defeat.

His campaign also announced that it would ask for a recount in Wisconsin, a state the AP called for Biden on Wednesday afternoon. Campaign manager Bill Stepien cited “irregularities in several Wisconsin counties,” without providing specifics.

Biden said Wednesday the count should continue in all states, adding, “No one’s going to take our democracy away from us — not now, not ever.”

Campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said legal challenges were not the behavior of a winning campaign.

“What makes these charades especially pathetic is that while Trump is demanding recounts in places he has already lost, he’s simultaneously engaged in fruitless attempts to halt the counting of votes in other states in which he’s on the road to defeat,” Bates said in a statement.

Election officials continued to count votes across the country, the normal process on the day following voting. Unlike in previous years, states were contending with an avalanche of mail ballots driven by fears of voting in person during a pandemic. At least 103 million people voted early, either by mail or in-person, representing 74% of the total votes cast in the 2016 presidential election.

Every election, results reported on election night are unofficial and the counting of ballots extends past Election Day. Mail ballots normally take more time to verify and count. This year, because of the large numbers of mail ballots and a close race, results were expected to take longer.

The Trump campaign said it is calling for a temporary halt in the counting in Michigan and Pennsylvania until it is given “meaningful” access in numerous locations and allowed to review ballots that already have been opened and processed.

The AP’s Michigan call for Biden came after the suit was filed. The president is ahead in Pennsylvania but his margin is shrinking as more mailed ballots are counted.

There have been no reports of fraud or any type of ballot concerns out of Pennsylvania. The state had 3.1 million mail-in ballots that take time to count and an order allows them to be received and counted up until Friday if they are postmarked by Nov. 3.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a CNN interview the lawsuit was “more a political document than a legal document.”

“There is transparency in this process. The counting has been going on. There are observers observing this counting, and the counting will continue,” he said.

The Michigan lawsuit claims Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, was allowing absentee ballots to be counted without teams of bipartisan observers as well as challengers. She’s accused of undermining the “constitutional right of all Michigan voters ... to participate in fair and lawful elections.” Michigan Democrats said the suit was a longshot.

Poll watchers from both sides were plentiful Wednesday at one major polling place in question — the TCF Center in Detroit, The Associated Press observed. They checked in at a table near the entrance to the convention center’s Hall E and strolled among the tables where ballot processing was taking place. In some cases, they arrived en masse and huddled together for a group discussion before fanning out to the floor. Uniformed Detroit police officers were on hand to make sure everyone was behaving.

Mark Brewer, a former state Democratic chairman who said he was observing the Detroit vote counting as a volunteer lawyer, said he had been at the TCF arena all day and had talked with others who had been there the past couple of days. He said Republicans had not been denied access.

“This is the best absentee ballot counting operation that Detroit has ever had. They are counting ballots very efficiently, despite the obstructing tactics of the Republicans.”

GOP lawyers had already launched legal challenges involving absentee votes in Pennsylvania and Nevada, contesting local decisions that could take on national significance in the close election.

In one appeal to a Pennsylvania appellate court, the Trump campaign complained that one of its representatives was prevented from seeing the writing on mail-in ballots that were being opened and processed in Philadelphia. A judge in Philadelphia dismissed it, saying that poll observers are directed to observe, not audit.

The Georgia lawsuit filed in Chatham County essentially asks a judge to ensure the state laws are being followed on absentee ballots. Campaign officials said they were considering peppering a dozen other counties around the state with similar claims around absentee ballots.

Trump, addressing supporters at the White House early Wednesday, talked about taking the undecided race to the Supreme Court. Though it was unclear what he meant, his comments evoked a reprise of the court’s intervention in the 2000 presidential election that ended with a decision effectively handing the presidency to George W. Bush.

But there are important differences from 2000 and they already were on display. In 2000, Republican-controlled Florida was the critical state and Bush clung to a small lead. Democrat Al Gore asked for a recount and the Supreme Court stopped it.

To some election law experts, calling for the Supreme Court to intervene now seemed premature, if not rash.

A case would have to come to the court from a state in which the outcome would determine the election’s winner, Richard Hasen, a University of California, Irvine, law professor, wrote on the Election Law blog. The difference between the candidates’ vote totals would have to be smaller than the ballots at stake in the lawsuit

“As of this moment (though things can change) it does not appear that either condition will be met,” Hasen wrote.

Ohio State University election law professor Edward Foley wrote on Twitter Wednesday: “The valid votes will be counted. (The Supreme Court) would be involved only if there were votes of questionable validity that would make a difference, which might not be the case. The rule of law will determine the official winner of the popular vote in each state. Let the rule of law work.”

Biden campaign attorney Bob Bauer said if Trump goes to the high court, “he will be in for one of the most embarrassing defeats a president has ever suffered by the highest court in the land.”

The justices could decide to step into the dispute over the three-day extension for absentee ballots if they prove crucial to the outcome in Pennsylvania.

Even a small number of contested votes could matter if a state determines the winner of the election and the gap between Trump and Biden is small.

QAnon conspiracy promoter Marjorie Taylor Greene wins seat in US Congress,117,jnz1e9,https://www.timesofisrael.com/qanon-conspiracy-promoter-marjorie-taylor-greene-wins-seat-in-us-congress/,17,1604533836.0,,"WASHINGTON — A Georgia woman who has promoted the baseless, far-right QAnon conspiracy theory won a seat in the US House of Representatives Tuesday, meaning the controversial and widely debunked movement will soon have a voice in Congress.

Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, who had never run for political office before, was well ahead and projected to win her race for US House District 14, some two months after US President Donald Trump hailed her as a “future Republican star.”

But her promotion of QAnon — a far-right movement claiming that Trump is waging a secret war against a global liberal cult of Satan-worshipping pedophiles — has raised eyebrows.

“BIG WIN TONIGHT!” the 46-year-old said on Twitter after she took a commanding lead over her Democratic rival in the safely Republican district. “THANK YOU to the people of NW Georgia for choosing me to fight for them in Washington, DC!”

Her primary victory in August over a more mainstream Republican illustrated the radicalization of US politics ahead of Tuesday’s Election Day, which features Trump facing off against Democratic challenger Joe Biden for the White House.

She ran on a “Save America, Stop Socialism” slogan, posted videos of herself holding a semi-automatic rifle and warning against “ANTIFA terrorists,” and pledged to be Trump’s “strongest ally in Congress.”

Greene has repeatedly railed against Biden and Democrats, including reportedly using vile language against Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and declaring that Democratic victories will erode American democracy and lead to socialism.

She has also called white men the most oppressed group in the United States.

And she promotes the smear that billionaire Democratic donor George Soros, a Jew who survived the Holocaust, was really a collaborator who “turned in his own people over to the Nazis.”

In 2017, she said that “Q is a patriot,” referring to the supposed secret whistleblower of QAnon who supporters claim is working from inside the Trump administration to reveal the deep state’s network of pedophiles and power brokers.

QAnon crept up three years ago on the fringes of social media but has since spilled into the mainstream thanks to widely shared posts on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.

Trump fueled the controversy in October when he refused to directly condemn the group, claiming in a televised town hall that he knew “nothing about QAnon,” only to say minutes later that “they are very much against pedophilia.”"
Oregon Measure 110 results: Voters decriminalize all drugs,89,jnxnpz,https://www.vox.com/2020/11/3/21514828/oregon-drug-decriminalization-measure-110-results,4,1604529063.0,,"Oregonians have made their state the first in the United States to decriminalize use of all drugs, including cocaine and heroin, after voting to approve Measure 110, according to the New York Times and the Associated Press.

The approval of the measure, one of several drug-related initiatives on the ballot November 3, doesn’t mean that the state has legalized the drugs.

Instead, Oregon will remove criminal penalties — including prison time — for possessing small amounts of currently illegal drugs, and will give those caught with drugs the option of either paying a $100 fine or getting a “completed health assessment” at an addiction recovery center. The sale of drugs will still be illegal, so don’t expect stores or pharmacies selling cocaine or heroin to pop up (at least legally).

The state will also now redirect existing marijuana sales tax revenues and savings from the measure — for example, savings from reduced prison time — toward setting up a more expansive drug addiction treatment and recovery program.

Advocates say Measure 110 replaces a criminal justice-centered approach to drugs with a public health one

Supporters of decriminalization argue that drug misuse and addiction are public health issues, not problems for the criminal justice system. They claim that criminal prohibition leads to hundreds of thousands of unneeded, racially disparate arrests each year in the US. And that this is a costly endeavor, straining police and contributing to mass incarceration, that does little to actually help people struggling with drug use.

It would be better, these advocates say, to put all that money toward education, treatment, and harm reduction services. And to the extent that drug use does contribute to crime and violence, there are other laws in place, including for drug trafficking, that can cover those issues without making possession itself a criminal offense.

Opponents argue that decriminalization removes a powerful deterrent to trying and using drugs, potentially fueling more drug use and addiction. They claim criminal penalties attached to drug possession can also be leveraged — through, say, drug courts — to push people into addiction treatment they otherwise wouldn’t accept. And they argue that to the extent there are real racial disparities in such arrests, that’s a problem with bias in law enforcement and systemic racism across American society in general, not necessarily a result of drug prohibition itself.

Some critics also questioned if the ballot initiative’s reallocation strategy will really direct sufficient funding to addiction treatment. The campaign in support of the measure claimed, citing state analyses, that it would at least quadruple state funding to recovery services.

Oregonians previously legalized marijuana. Although some states have ended felony charges for use of all illegal drugs, Oregon is the first in the US to take the more aggressive step to decriminalize them.

But Oregon isn’t the first place in the world to decriminalize drugs. Portugal did it in 2001, earning a lot of continued media coverage (including at Vox). The effects seemed, on net, positive: Coupled with boosts to drug addiction treatment and harm reduction services, drug decriminalization seemed to lead to more drug use overall but less problematic use.

Citing Portugal’s model, critics of the war on drugs have long clamored to bring the model to the US. With Oregon’s vote, they now have a launching pad — one to not just prove that the idea can work in the US, but also to maybe inspire other states to take more aggressive steps toward ending their drug wars.

Donald Trump Declares Election Fraud; Falsely Claims “We Already Won”,473,jnue29,https://deadline.com/2020/11/donald-trump-2020-presidential-election-joe-biden-1234608864/,123,1604514338.0,,"Donald Trump tonight raised the specter of a bitter challenge of the remaining ballots to be counted in the presidential race, telling a crowd of supporters at the White House that “as far as I am concerned we have already won.”

The incumbent also said that he would be going to the Supreme Court, saying, “We want all the voting to stop.” Trump added: “This is a fraud on the American public.”

But what the former Celebrity Apprentice host said does not reflect the reality of a fairly normal part of the election process.

What has been happening in states like Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan is that remaining ballots remain to be counted, including mail-in ballots in Democratic-leaning metro areas. The vote counting has taken longer than normal because of the sheer number of absentee returns.

Trump’s suggestion that he already won — and suggestion that remaining ballots should be discounted — drew a quick rebuke from network news anchors and pundits.

“This is straight up autocratic malarkey,” said Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC. On CBS News, Norah O’Donnell said that Trump was “castrating the facts of the election results” that have been reported, falsely claiming that he has won the election.

Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace said, “This is an extremely flammable situation and the president just threw a match into it. He hasn’t won these states. Nobody is saying he’s won the states. The states haven’t said that he’s won. You know, this goes right back to what Joe Biden said, which is that the president doesn’t get to say that he’s won states that, you know, the American people get to say it, the state officials get to declare it.”

NBC News cut away from Trump’s speech to Savannah Guthrie, who said, “the president is going through some of the states, stating that he has prevailed in those states, naming Georgia, saying they’re winning Georgia, or that they won Georgia. …The fact of the matter is those states have not come close to counting all of their vote. There’s still outstanding vote.”

In his remarks, Trump claimed that “a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people, and we won’t stand for it.” But he didn’t seem to challenge the counting of remaining votes in Arizona, where he trails Biden and the race has been called by Fox News.

“This is a nightmare scenario,” Yamiche Alcindor said on PBS Newshour.

On CNN, Ben Ginsburg, a veteran election lawyer for the GOP, said, “These are all legally cast votes and the process of trying to toss them out for some reason would just, I think, be viewed by any court, in the Supreme Court, as just a massive disenfranchisement that would be frowned upon.”

Many predicted a scenario in which Trump declares victory and falsely claims that the remaining results would be fraudulent. Although he boasted of a lead in Pennsylvania, a huge chunk of the vote is not yet in in Pennsylvania.

More to come."
"Jewish cemetery in Michigan vandalized with 'Trump,' 'MAGA' before Trump's rally",329,jnbzrl,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/03/michigan-jewish-cemetery-desecrated-maga-before-trumps-rally/6135923002/,83,1604445306.0,,"CLOSE Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump held his final campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan early Tuesday morning. Trump predicted that he will win Michigan and the White House. (Nov. 8)

Hours before President Donald Trump arrived in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for his final campaign rally, police received a report that several tombstones in a Jewish cemetery there were spray-painted with messages in support for the president.

The Anti-Defamation League of Michigan shared photos Monday of tombstones in the Ahavas Israel Cemetery that had been defaced with “Trump” and “MAGA” in red spray paint.

""We are in close touch with the Jewish community and Law Enforcement to investigate this vandalism,"" the civil rights organization said on Twitter.

The incident was reported around 11 a.m. on Monday, but the vandalism may have occurred three to five days before it was discovered, said Sgt. John Wittkowski of the Grand Rapids Police Department.

We are appalled by the reported desecration of gravestones at the Ahavas Israel Cemetery in Grand Rapids, MI. We are in close touch with the Jewish community and Law Enforcement to investigate this vandalism. pic.twitter.com/mVeGrlsWxE — ADL Michigan (@ADLMichigan) November 2, 2020

Wittkowski said police have no leads because the Ahavas Israel Cemetery is in a relatively isolated area next to cemeteries of multiple denominations with no cameras.

""We're still investigating this,"" Wittkowski said. ""We're just crossing our fingers at this point.""

When asked if he believes the attack was anti-Semitic, he said it's unclear.

Carolyn Normandin, the ADL’s Michigan regional director, told The Washington Post at least six tombstones were defaced with the graffiti in the ""disgusting and vile"" incident.

Both Normandin and David J.B. Krishef, the rabbi at Ahavas Israel, also said it's unclear if the desecration was specifically an attack on the Jewish community.

""There were no other words or symbols painted that would clearly indicate that it was an antisemitic attack,"" Krishef said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""It may just have been opportunistic vandalism against a cemetery which is isolated and hard to see from the road, on Halloween weekend, not an attack against the Jewish community. We don’t know.""

In Michigan and across the country, reports of anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise. More than 2,100 acts of assault, vandalism and harassment against the Jewish community were reported in 2019, the highest level since the ADL began tracking that data in 1979. In Michigan, anti-Semitic incidents doubled from 2018 to 2019.

The Michigan Democratic Jewish Caucus said the incident will not deter them from going to the polls on Election Day.

“Make no mistake, this heinous act was committed on the eve of the 2020 election to send an intimidating message to the president’s opponents, and particularly, Jewish voters,” the group said in a statement. ""Grand Rapids’ Jewish community will not be cowed by this vile attack on Ahavas Israel.""

"Exclusive: Tired of Trump, Deutsche Bank games ways to sever ties with the president - sources",373,jn93lm,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-deutsche-bank-exclusive/exclusive-tired-of-trump-deutsche-bank-wants-out-but-sees-no-good-options-sources-idUSKBN27J0G0,31,1604433856.0,,"NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG is looking for ways to end its relationship with President Donald Trump after the U.S. elections, as it tires of the negative publicity stemming from the ties, according to three senior bank officials with direct knowledge of the matter.

Deutsche Bank has about $340 million in loans outstanding to the Trump Organization, the president’s umbrella group that is currently overseen by his two sons, according to filings made by Trump to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in July and a senior source within the bank. The three loans, which are against Trump properties and start coming due in two years, are current on payments and personally guaranteed by the president, according to two bank officials.

In meetings in recent months, a Deutsche Bank management committee that oversees reputational and other risks for the lender in the Americas region has discussed ways in which it could rid the bank of these last vestiges of the relationship, two of the three bank officials said. The bank has over the years lent Trump more than $2 billion, one of the officials said.

One idea that has come up in the meetings: sell the loans in the secondary market, two of the bank officials said. But one of the officials said that idea has not gained traction, in part because it is not clear who would want to buy the loans and the attendant problems that come with it.

While it was known that Deutsche Bank has been closely examining its relationship with Trump, including by setting up a working group in 2016 to review the bank’s relationship with him, its recent eagerness to end all ties and the contours of discussions in light of the election have not been previously reported.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.

WARREN’S WARNING

The German bank, which first started lending to Trump in the late 1990s, has been dragged into congressional and other investigations into the real estate mogul-turned-politician’s finances and alleged Russia connections.

The probes and the bad press, seen by one senior executive as “serious collateral damage” from the relationship, are an unwelcome distraction for the bank, the three officials said. It comes at a time when Chief Executive Christian Sewing is trying to turn Deutsche Bank around after its decades-long run at becoming a major Wall Street bank left it nursing huge losses.

Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat member of the Senate banking committee, has previously called for an investigation into Deutsche Bank over its money laundering controls and has demanded answers from the lender about its relationship with Trump and his family. She told Reuters that she intended to keep pushing for a probe in the next administration.

“You bet I’m going to continue to fight for accountability and strong enforcement of our banking laws, especially for giant institutions like Deutsche Bank,” she said.

What happens next for the bank rests on the outcome of Tuesday’s elections, according to the three bank officials.

If the Republican president loses, and Democrats take control of the White House and Congress, senior Deutsche Bank executives believe congressional investigations that have stalled amid a court battle over access to Trump’s financial records could be rejuvenated, the three bank officials said.

In this scenario, however, Deutsche Bank executives believe they will also have more freedom to deal with the loans and end their relationship with Trump, the officials said. They hope doing so might help reduce some of the scrutiny, they said.

DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

The loans, which are against Trump’s golf course in Miami, and hotels in Washington and Chicago, are such that the Trump Organization has only had to pay interest on them so far, and the entire principal is outstanding, two of the three bank officials said. They come due in 2023 and 2024, the filings show.

The businesses backing the loans face challenges. The coronavirus-driven economic slowdown has hit the travel industry, including hotels. Moreover, last month Reuters reported that Trump’s plan to make money by developing houses and hotels on his golf courses, including the one involving the Deutsche Bank loan, had not panned out so far.

The Deutsche Bank executives are not unduly concerned about Trump’s ability to repay the loans, given the president’s personal guarantees and the time left before they come due, the three bank officials said.

If Trump is not in office, Deutsche Bank executives feel that it would be easier for them to demand repayment, foreclose if he is not able to pay it off or refinance, or try to sell the loans, according to two of the three bank officials.

Since Trump has personally guaranteed all the loans, Deutsche Bank could also seize the president’s assets if he is unable to repay, two of the three bank officials said.

If Trump wins a second term, Deutsche Bank executives feel their options would be fewer, the three bank officials said. The bank wouldn’t want the negative publicity inherent with seizing assets from a sitting president and would likely extend the loans until he is out of office, two of the bank officials said.

The bottom line, the three bank officials said, is that the matter won’t be resolved until well after the election."
Supreme Court issues rare ruling against protections for law enforcement officials,135,jmsoht,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/523985-supreme-court-issues-rare-ruling-against-protections-for-law,10,1604369163.0,,"The Supreme Court on Monday overturned a lower court's decision that granted long-standing protections to corrections officers who allegedly kept an inmate housed in ""shockingly unsanitary cells"" for six days.

The decision is a rare rebuke to law enforcement officials invoking the controversial legal doctrine known as qualified immunity, which often shields officers from civil lawsuits for illegal conduct.

In its 7-1 decision, the Supreme Court said the horrific conditions described by Trent Taylor, a prison inmate in Texas serving an 11-year sentence for robbery, were so egregious that corrections officers would not be covered by qualified immunity.

Taylor alleged he was transferred to a prison psychiatric unit in Montford, Texas, after attempting suicide. He said he was stripped naked and housed in a cell with human feces that covered nearly every surface and was even packed in the unit's water faucet.

Fearing that any food or water would be contaminated in those conditions, Taylor allegedly refused to eat or drink anything for the four days he was housed in the cell. He was then moved to a new cell that had no sink, toilet or bed, only a drain that had been overflowing with sewage.

Taylor said he spent two full days in the second cell, still naked, and held his urine for 24 hours until he relieved himself in the clogged drain because prison officials would not take him to a restroom. He said the experience led to a distended bladder requiring the insertion of a catheter.

Taylor sued the prison officials, arguing that his confinement during the six-day period was unconstitutional. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the prison guards' conduct violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" but that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity because no court had clearly established that the conditions they imposed on Taylor were unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court disagreed, saying in Monday's unsigned opinion that ""confronted with the particularly egregious facts of this case, any reasonable officer should have realized that Taylor’s conditions of confinement offended the Constitution.""

""Texas prison officials subjected our client, Trent Taylor, to horrific abuse by keeping him naked in cells covered in human feces for six days. Today the Supreme Court rightly recognized that any reasonable officer should have realized that such conditions offended the Constitution,"" Cruikshank added.

The qualified immunity doctrine has come under increased scrutiny amid the nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Critics of the doctrine argue it imposes overly burdensome hurdles for victims of police brutality to hold officers legally accountable.

For a plaintiff to overcome qualified immunity in a civil lawsuit against law enforcement, they have to show not only that the conduct they allege was illegal but that a prior court had already clearly established it as unlawful, so that a reasonable person would recognize it as such.

The Supreme Court has been unwilling to take up the question of whether qualified immunity should be altered or ended.

A bill passed by the House over the summer would end qualified immunity for law enforcement officials. The GOP-controlled Senate did not take up the measure and instead voted on a Republican-backed measure that, among other things, did not include the qualified immunity provision.

“He specifically told me, ‘You are no longer my mother, because you are voting for Trump’,” Gomez, 41, a personal care worker in Milwaukee, told Reuters. Their last conversation was so bitter that she is not sure they can reconcile, even if Trump loses his re-election bid.

“The damage is done. In people’s minds, Trump is a monster. It’s sad. There are people not talking to me anymore, and I’m not sure that will change,” said Gomez, who is a fan of Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigrants and handling of the economy.

Gomez is not alone in thinking the bitter splits within families and among friends over Trump’s tumultuous presidency will be difficult, if not impossible, to repair, even after he leaves office - whenever that is.

In interviews with 10 voters - five Trump supporters and five backing Democratic candidate Joe Biden - few could see the wrecked personal relationships caused by Trump’s tenure fully healing, and most believed them destroyed forever.

Throughout his nearly four-year norm-smashing presidency, Trump has stirred strong emotions among both supporters and opponents. Many of his backers admire his moves to overhaul immigration, his appointment of conservative judges, his willingness to throw convention to the wind and his harsh rhetoric, which they call straight talk.

Democrats and other critics see the former real estate developer and reality show personality as a threat to American democracy, a serial liar and a racist who mismanaged the novel coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 people in the United States so far. Trump dismisses those characterizations as “fake news.”

Now, with Trump trailing Biden in opinion polls, people are beginning to ask whether the fractures caused by one of the most polarizing presidencies in U.S. history could be healed if Trump loses the election.

“Unfortunately, I don’t think national healing is as easy as changing the president,” said Jaime Saal, a psychotherapist at the Rochester Center for Behavioral Medicine in Rochester Hills, Michigan.

“It takes time and it takes effort, and it takes both parties – no pun intended – being willing to let go and move forward,” she said.

Saal said tensions in people’s personal relationships have spiked given the political, health and social dynamics facing the United States. Most often she sees clients who have political rifts with siblings, parents or in-laws, as opposed to spouses.

NEIGHBOR VS NEIGHBOR

Trump’s election in 2016 divided families, tore up friendships and turned neighbor against neighbor. Many have turned to Facebook and Twitter to deliver no-holds-barred posts bashing both Trump and his many critics, while the president’s own freewheeling tweets have also inflamed tensions.

A September report by the non-partisan Pew Research Center found that nearly 80% of Trump and Biden supporters said they had few or no friends who supported the other candidate.

A study by the Gallup polling organization in January found that Trump’s third year in office set a new record for party polarization. While 89% of Republicans approved of Trump’s performance in office in 2019, only 7% of Democrats thought he was doing a good job.

Gayle McCormick, 77, who separated from her husband William, 81, after he voted for Trump in 2016, said, “I think the legacy of Trump is going to take a long time to recover from.”

The two still spend time together, although she is now based in Vancouver, he in Alaska. Two of her grandchildren no longer speak to her because of her support for Democrat Hillary Clinton four years ago. She has also become estranged from other relatives and friends who are Trump supporters.

She is not sure those rifts with friends and family will ever mend, because each believes the other to have a totally alien value system.

Democratic voter Rosanna Guadagno, 49, said her brother disowned her after she refused to support Trump four years ago. Last year her mother suffered a stroke, but her brother - who lived in the same California city as her mother - did not let her know when their mother died six months later. She was told the news after three days in an email from her sister-in-law.

“I was excluded from everything that had to do with her death, and it was devastating,” said Guadagno, a social psychologist who works at Stanford University, California.

Whoever wins the election, Guadagno is pessimistic that she can reconcile with her brother, although she says she still loves him.

UNCERTAIN POST-TRUMP WORLD

Sarah Guth, 39, a Spanish interpreter from Denver, Colorado, said she has cut several Trump-supporting friends out of her life. She could not reconcile herself to their support for issues such as separating immigrant children from parents at the southern border, or for Trump himself after he was caught on tape bragging about groping women.

Guth and her Trump-voting father did not speak to each other for several months after the 2016 election. The two now do speak, but avoid politics.

Guth says some of her friends cannot accept her support for a candidate - Joe Biden - who is pro-choice on the question of abortion.

“We had such fundamental disagreements about such basic stuff. It showed both sides that we really don’t have anything in common. I don’t believe that will change in the post-Trump era.”

Fervent Trump supporter Dave Wallace, 65, a retired oil industry sales manager in West Chester, Pennsylvania, is more optimistic about feuding families in a post-Trump world.

Wallace says his support for Trump has caused tensions with his son and daughter-in-law.

“The hatred for Trump among Democrats, it’s just amazing to me,” Wallace said. “I think it’s just Trump, the way he makes people feel. I do think the angst will decrease when we’re back to a normal politician who doesn’t piss people off.”

Jay J. Van Bavel, a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University, said this “political sectarianism” has become not only tribal, but moral.

“Because Trump has been one of the most polarizing figures in American history around core values and issues, people are unwilling to compromise and that is not something you can make go away,” Van Bavel said.

Jacquelyn Hammond, 47, a bartender in Asheville, North Carolina, no longer speaks to her Trump-supporting mother Carol.

“I also discouraged my son from talking to my mom about politics. I’m not letting her influence him politically,” Hammond said.

She said she would like to heal the relationship, but believes that will be difficult, even if Trump loses the election.

“Trump is like the catalyst of an earthquake that just divided two continents of thought. Once the Earth divides like that, there’s no going back. This is a marked time in our history where people had to jump from one side to the other. And depending on what side you choose, that is going to be the trajectory for the rest of your life,” she said.

Hammond said she first realized her relationship with her mother was in trouble shortly after the 2016 election when she defended Clinton while driving with her mother.

“She stopped the car and told me not to disrespect her politics. And if I don’t want to respect her politics, I can get out of the car.”

Bonnie Coughlin, 65, has voted mostly Republican all her life, except in 2016 when she backed a third party candidate. This time she is all in for Biden, even holding a small rally for him on the side of a highway near Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania.

Raised in a Republican, religiously conservative family in Missouri, she says her relationships with her sister, father and some cousins - all ardent Trump supporters - have soured.

Coughlin says she still loves them, but “I look at them differently. It’s because they have willingly embraced someone who is so heartless and just shows no empathy to anyone in any circumstances.”

She added: “And if Biden wins, I don’t think they will go quietly into the night and accept it.”"
Scoop: Trump's plan to declare premature victory,51,jmc86t,https://www.axios.com/trump-claim-election-victory-ballots-97eb12b9-5e35-402f-9ea3-0ccfb47f613f.html,9,1604301084.0,,"President Trump has told confidants he'll declare victory on Tuesday night if it looks like he's ""ahead,"" according to three sources familiar with his private comments. That's even if the Electoral College outcome still hinges on large numbers of uncounted votes in key states like Pennsylvania.

The latest: Speaking to reporters on Sunday evening, Trump denied that he would declare victory prematurely, before adding, ""I think it's a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election. I think it's a terrible thing when states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over.""

He continued: ""I think it's terrible that we can't know the results of an election the night of the election. ... We're going to go in the night of, as soon as that election's over, we're going in with our lawyers.""

""We don't want to have Pennsylvania, where you have a political governor, a very partisan guy. ... We don't want to be in a position where he's allowed, every day, to watch ballots come in. See if we can only find 10,000 more ballots.""

Behind the scenes: Trump has privately talked through this scenario in some detail in the last few weeks, describing plans to walk up to a podium on election night and declare he has won.

For this to happen, his allies expect he would need to either win or have commanding leads in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Arizona and Georgia.

Why it matters: Trump's team is preparing to falsely claim that mail-in ballots counted after Nov. 3 — a legitimate count expected to favor Democrats — are evidence of election fraud.

Details: Many prognosticators say that on election night, Trump will likely appear ahead in Pennsylvania — though the state's final outcome could change substantially as mail-in ballots are counted over the following days.

Trump's team is preparing to claim baselessly that if that process changes the outcome in Pennsylvania from the picture on election night, then Democrats would have ""stolen"" the election.

Trump's advisers have been laying the groundwork for this strategy for weeks, but this is the first account of Trump explicitly discussing his election night intentions.

What they're saying: Asked for comment, the Trump campaign's communications director Tim Murtaugh said, ""This is nothing but people trying to create doubt about a Trump victory. When he wins, he's going to say so.""

Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller predicted that Trump ""will be re-elected handily and no amount of post-election Democratic thievery will be able to change the results.""

Reality check: Mail-in ballots counted after Election Day as set forth in state-by-state rules are as legitimate as in-person votes recorded on Nov. 3.

Many states won't be done counting mail ballots by Tuesday night.

In Pennsylvania, state law prevents election officials from counting mail-in ballots before Election Day.

Night-of counts may be deceptive. It could be days, if not weeks, before we know who won Pennsylvania. If it's a close race, this could also be true for other states, given the record numbers of Americans who voted by mail this year.

Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" today that there could be 10x as many mail ballots this year than in 2016, ""so, yes, it will take longer"" to count.

""I expect that the overwhelming majority of ballots in Pennsylvania, that's mail-in and absentee ballots, as well as in-person ballots, will be counted within a matter of days,"" Boockvar said.

What we're watching: Miller, on ABC's ""This Week,"" predicted 290+ electoral votes for Trump on election night, and he claimed Democrats are ""just going to try to steal it back after the election.""

He described any prospective challenges by Democrats as ""hijinks or lawsuits or whatever kind of nonsense.""

Between the lines: Trump advisers are more optimistic about winning than they were three weeks ago, based on my conversations with multiple senior campaign officials over the past week, including two officials with direct knowledge of sensitive internal data.

They said analyses of early-vote totals in battleground states indicate he's doing substantially worse in Iowa and Georgia compared with this point in 2016, but better than expected in Texas, Nevada, North Carolina, Arizona and Wisconsin.

Just a few weeks ago, senior Trump advisers were bearish about Wisconsin and had reduced TV advertising there to an insignificant figure. A senior campaign official told me, then, that the state didn't figure in his paths to 270 electoral votes.

But that appears to have changed. In recent days, senior Trump advisers have privately expressed growing optimism about Wisconsin, based on their analysis of early vote data.

The other side: “It comes as no surprise that Donald Trump and his campaign plan to declare victory before all the votes are counted. That has been his strategy for months, and nobody should fall for it,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a statement to Axios."
Texas Supreme Court rejects Republican effort to toss nearly 127K votes,558,jmaxbc,https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/01/texas-drive-thru-votes-harris-county/,81,1604296503.0,,"Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.

A legal cloud hanging over nearly 127,000 votes already cast in Harris County was at least temporarily lifted Sunday when the Texas Supreme Court rejected a request by several conservative Republican activists and candidates to preemptively throw out early balloting from drive-thru polling sites in the state's most populous, and largely Democratic, county.

The all-Republican court denied the request without an order or opinion, as justices did last month in a similar lawsuit brought by some of the same plaintiffs.

Voting in Texas When was the last day to register to vote?

When can I vote early?

How will voting be different because of the pandemic?

How do I know if I qualify to vote by mail?

Are polling locations the same on Election Day as they are during early voting?

Can I still vote if I have COVID-19? Supported By:

The Republican plaintiffs, however, are pursuing a similar lawsuit in federal court, hoping to get the votes thrown out by arguing that drive-thru voting violates the U.S. constitution. A hearing in that case is set for Monday morning in a Houston-based federal district court, one day before Election Day. A rejection of the votes would constitute a monumental disenfranchisement of voters — drive-thru ballots account for about 10% of all in-person ballots cast during early voting in Harris County.

After testing the approach during the July primary runoff with little controversy, Harris County, home to Houston, set up 10 drive-thru centers for the fall election to make early voting easier for people concerned about entering polling places during the pandemic. Voters pull up in their cars and, after their registrations and identifications have been confirmed by poll workers, are handed an electronic tablet through their car windows to cast ballots.

In a last-minute filing to the Supreme Court, litigious conservative Steven Hotze and Harris County Republicans state Rep. Steve Toth, congressional candidate Wendell Champion and judicial candidate Sharon Hemphill sought to have the votes declared illegal. They argued that the drive-thru program was an expansion of curbside voting and under state election law should only be available for voters with disabilities. The same argument had been made in an unsuccessful previous legal challenge from Hotze and Hemphill — along with the Harris County Republican Party — filed at the state Supreme Court hours before early voting began.

Curbside voting, long available under Texas election law, requires workers at every polling place to deliver onsite curbside ballots to voters who are “physically unable to enter the polling place without personal assistance or likelihood of injuring the voter's health.” Posted signs at polling sites notify voters to ring a bell, call a number or honk to request curbside assistance.

The Harris County Clerk’s Office argued that its drive-thru locations are separate polling places, distinct from attached curbside spots, and therefore can be available to all voters. The clerk’s filing with the Supreme Court in the earlier lawsuit also said the Texas secretary of state’s office had approved of drive-thru voting. Keith Ingram, the state’s chief election official, said in a court hearing last month in another lawsuit that drive-thru voting is “a creative approach that is probably okay legally,” according to court transcripts.

Plus, the county argued in a Friday filing that Texas' election code, along with court rulings, have determined that even if the drive-thru locations are violations, votes cast there are still valid.

""More than a century of Texas case law requires that votes be counted even if election official[s] violate directory election laws,"" the filing said.

The challenge was the latest in a flurry of lawsuits on Texas voting procedures filed in recent months, with Democrats and voting rights groups pushing for expanded voting access in the pandemic and Republicans seeking to limit voting options. In this case, the lawsuit filed Tuesday asked the state Supreme Court to close Harris County’s 10 new drive-thru polling places and not count votes that had been cast at them during early voting.

The court has recently ruled against other last-minute challenges on voting access by noting that the cases were filed too late and that changes to voting procedure during an election would sow voter confusion.

Since the first Republican challenge to drive-thru voting was filed on Oct. 12, the Texas secretary of state and Gov. Greg Abbott had both ignored requests from reporters and Harris County officials to clarify their positions on whether the process was legal. Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a letter to all local election officials claiming that most voters can’t legally vote at drive-thru locations, fueling speculation that the all-Republican Supreme Court would use the case to invalidate ballots already cast. The court rejected the case the next week, with a lone dissent from Justice John Devine.

The new challenge by Republicans again asked the court to reject drive-thru voting as an illegal expansion of curbside voting, and went further by also asking the court to issue an order rejecting votes already cast.

“Unless stopped, illegal votes will be cast and counted in direct violation of the Texas Election Code and the United States Constitution and result in the integrity of elections in Harris County being compromised,” the petition to the court said.

The county clerk's office countered that the first challenge to drive-thru voting had already been denied, and the second filing came much too late.

""Hotze filed a petition contesting drive thru locations on the third day of early voting which this Court already denied,"" the clerk's Friday filing said. ""He filed this second petition two and a half weeks into early voting, six days before Election Day, and after fifty percent of registered voters have already voted.""

The tens of thousands of votes are still in flux, however, as the federal courts now weigh the issue. Hotze and the others asked the district court this week to toss the votes, arguing the county's implementation of drive-thru voting violates the U.S. Constitution. The campaign of Texas' Democratic U.S. Senate candidate, MJ Hegar, along with national Democratic campaign groups have asked to intervene in the lawsuit — following a national trend in Republican-led fights against voting expansions during the tumultuous election.

Biden staff call 911 after bus swarmed by Trump supporters on Texas highway,513,jm3wkj,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/31/trump-train-swarms-biden-bus-texas-event-canceled/6110370002/,182,1604272740.0,,"CLOSE Biden staff call 911 after bus surrounded by Trump supporters on Texas highway Wochit

AUSTIN, Texas – A caravan of vehicles displaying Trump campaign flags and signs swarmed a Biden campaign bus between San Antonio and Austin on Friday afternoon, leading the Democrats on board to call 911 and cancel the Austin close of their “Battle for the Soul of the Nation” tour.

According to the Biden campaign, the vehicles surrounded the bus, trying to slow it down in the middle of the highway or run it off the road. Biden staff notified 911 and local law enforcement, and, they reported, local law enforcement helped the bus reach its Austin destination.

The FBI said it is “aware of the incident and investigating."" That prompted an unhappy response from President Donald Trump on Twitter.

On Sunday night, Trump retweeted a screenshot of the FBI statement, adding: “In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong. Instead, the FBI & Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA, who run around burning down our Democrat run cities and hurting our people!”

Neither Biden nor Harris was on the bus when the confrontation happened. Biden was campaigning Friday in Des Moines, Iowa; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Milwaukee. Harris campaigned Friday in Texas, but she was in Fort Worth, McAllen and Houston and flew to those events, according to reporters who accompanied her. Supporters of the two campaigns shouted at one another outside the Fort Worth event, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Biden told reporters in Philadelphia on Sunday that he had never seen anything like the bus incident.

“It was on an interstate highway in Texas, and a bunch of Trump trucks, pickup trucks ... tried to run it off the road, they stopped in front of it,” Biden said. “And the president saw it, took the video that someone had taken, and tweeted it back out and said ‘I love Texas.’”

“We’ve never had anything like this – at least we’ve never had a president who thinks it’s a good thing,” Biden said.

“Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm’s way,” Tariq Thowfeek, Texas communications director of the Biden campaign, said in a statement Saturday.

No one was injured. No one was arrested. It is evident on a video of the incident that there was a glancing but obvious contact between a black Trump pickup and a white car apparently being driven behind the bus by a Biden campaign staffer, but no apparent serious or disabling damage.

This is a traffic violation and attempted homicide. Why hasn’t anyone been arrested? pic.twitter.com/QnfF4vXMQn — haunting student debt owners (@mcbyrne) October 31, 2020

On Saturday, Trump shared an edited video that appears to be of the incident, tweeting ""I love Texas!"" in all caps.

The incident occurred in the midst of the biggest day of the presidential campaign yet for Texas Democrats as Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris spent a full day campaigning in the state, which is now viewed as a toss-up in Tuesday’s election.

The state party and the Biden campaign did not seek to draw much attention to the highway encounter between the Biden-Harris bus and one of the car caravans of Trump supporters that have come to be known as Trump Trains.

But other observers sought to draw attention to what they considered a potentially perilous situation. They included Dr. Eric Cervini, a historian and author from Los Angeles who came to Texas to help the Biden campaign.

These tactics have no place in Texas, my home state, and no place in America.



Please vote. Please volunteer this weekend. The future of our democracy is at stake. pic.twitter.com/G0O4yg2vnJ — Dr. Eric Cervini (@ericcervini) October 31, 2020

Cervini was on the scene and posted video and a series of tweets, describing the event as an “ambush” by armed Trump supporters in pickup trucks with Trump flags seeking to run the Biden bus off the road

“They outnumbered police 50-1, and they ended up hitting a staffer’s car,” Cervini tweeted.

In Louisville on Sunday, about 100 “Trump Train” drivers clashed with several protesters at a high school. The protesters, who were upset the group was allowed to use school property, tried to block vehicles from leaving the parking lot with their cars.

Police officers in Middletown, Kentucky, were at the scene and arrested one protester during the confrontation, department Chief Robert Herman confirmed.

Trump supporters eventually drove over a curb and across the school's lawn to get to the road before driving to the fairgrounds for the caravan.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — One day, on a walk in the middle of a workday, I came across a gorgeous red finch on a sunny sidewalk that didn’t fly off when I approached it. It barely put up a fight when I picked it up with a tissue.

I had hoped to take it to the nearby wildlife rehab people. Maybe they could save it. So I walked back to my house and put it in an open plastic tub on my shady porch with seed and water.

I called the rehab people. I knew from past injured wildlife encounters that I should call ahead. The line was busy. Every time I checked on him, I felt a greater urgency. His breathing had increased and he was shaking a little. Their line remained busy.

ADVERTISEMENT

Less than two hours later, his breathing had stopped.

I cried. I just couldn’t hold back.

___

I’m struggling. And I have been for awhile.

A lot of us are. There’s a pandemic going on, and we are all isolated from each other. There’s a recession looming, maybe even a depression. And a divisive election, no matter which side you support.

But it feels like so much more. None of my emotions seem to want to hide anymore.

There’s anger, irritation, sadness. Muting life with Netflix has an upside-down reaction for me: I’m crying at happy scenes and sobbing over suspenseful or stressful scenes. I wake at night with bouts of anxiety.

As a reporter, I’ve told the stories of countless tragedies over the last 20 years: mass murders, murder trials, tornadoes where people lost everything, any number of horrific crimes and dramatic hardships. Why does this feel so different?

It finally dawned on me: Death seems so close to everyone, more than I can ever remember. In the United States, for many, it hasn’t been quite this way for a really long time.

So far, more than 225,000 people have died in the United States from the coronavirus or complications, according to Johns Hopkins University. On the entire planet, more than 45 million have been infected and more than 1.1 million are dead.

All that pain and suffering. All those individual stories. And right now, with the numbers of infected soaring in Wisconsin, where I live, my anxiety skyrockets.

Even physicians are dealing with anxiety, some for the first time, says Joan Anzia, psychiatrist and professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. She often counsels those in the health care field and says this sense of mortality is even hitting them.

“It’s been decades since physicians have had to endanger their own lives and put their own life at risk just by going to work,” she tells me when I call her.

ADVERTISEMENT

The last time a life-threatening health crisis of this scale engulfed American society was early in the last century: the 1918 flu pandemic. Less widespread was polio, before a vaccine emerged in the 1950s.

Medical advancements though, have pushed death away, made it feel less familiar. Babies don’t die as regularly. At one point before the funeral industry took off in the 19th century, funerals were held in the dead person’s house — with the body present. Death, when it came, was nearer, less alien.

How did that change? According to Genevieve Keeney, CEO of the National Museum of Funeral History in Houston, the rise of the funeral industry changed the location of what happened after death and produced a disconnection. But more to blame, she believes, is the constant, often graphic portrayals of death in entertainment and news — making it a commodity for storytelling.

“We lost its meaning of what it’s trying to say,” she says.

For me, being in the news business, I relate closely with stories of COVID and death because I have seen dying firsthand throughout my career.

There’s the story about the son bringing in his mom to the ER for the virus. She survived and he didn’t. A couple married 60 years dies within 48 hours of each other. There’s my co-worker in New York who ran marathons around the world but ultimately fell to the virus.

But what has been commonplace for certain groups — police, doctors, journalists — has arrived at many more doorsteps this year.

“This isn’t simply an isolated event or story on the news that you feel empathy for. But in some way or another this virus has impacted nearly every person’s life ,” says Elyssa Barbash, a psychologist at Tampa Therapy in Florida. As she sees it, we’re not only mourning because of the death around us; we’re also mourning that old way of living.

“This entire situation happened pretty rapidly and no one was prepared for the substantial life changes it brought,” she says. “Grief comes in a lot of forms, but is ultimately about loss. ”

That could be me. My dad passed away in March in a nursing home. He had dementia and had been declining. My uncle with Down Syndrome, to whom I had been close all my life, died last fall. My sweet cat George died last summer.

Further complicating things: my intense need to protect my 76-year-old mother, who is in a high-risk group. She lives alone, but the isolation is getting to her. I can’t say I’m surprised.

Death is inevitable. So why does this feel so different?

Maybe the answer lies in American culture and history. I asked Anita Hanning, who studies culture and how it deals with death and dying.

“The coronavirus is really pushing our noses into the fact of our mortality. And that is a truth that is always present, but that not many of us are choosing to engage with on a regular basis,” says Hanning, an associate professor of anthropology at Brandeis University in Massachusetts.

What doesn’t help, she says, is that Americans associate death with failure by medicine rather than a natural part of life. And they tend to concentrate on living longer rather than “the quality of our days.”

“We’ve really kind of lost the language and the experience to really engage with our mortality in more healthy ways,” she says.

This attitude of medicine being all-powerful started to develop after medicine started really making advances in the late 19th century, according to Nancy Tomes, a history professor at Stony Brook University in New York.

“Young folks seemed so surprised that there isn’t a way to cure this, that there isn’t a vaccine that you could pull out of your hat in six weeks,” says Tomes, author of “The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women, and the Microbe in American Life.”

During the 1918 flu, people were somewhat accustomed to dealing with infectious diseases, considering the No. 1 cause of death in 1900 was tuberculosis, she said. Also circulating was polio.

“So people go in to 1918, 1919, having this worldview that infectious diseases can kill you,” she said. “They will all have known someone who died of an infectious disease.”

Today’s unfamiliarity and lack of fear could help explain why some people don’t wear masks or distance to mitigate risk for others. It’s been a trigger for me because they represent an increased risk of catching the virus. And in my head, it’s very catchable.

Did I have it back in mid-March, right after my dad’s funeral, right before that sort of thing was completely prohibited? I don’t know. A couple people showed up sick. I had an on-and-off fever, chest pressure, extreme exhaustion.

Since it’s so contagious, I couldn’t shake the idea that my entire family would also get it. It didn’t help that when I was lying in bed sick I saw a news story about four family members dying from the virus after attending the same family dinner in New Jersey.

Fear of getting the coronavirus reminds Margaret “Elaine” Stalheim, 92, of the fear of getting polio, which happened to her when she was in her early 20s and starting her family. She remembers the isolation and the quarantine signs on homes. She recovered after months of physical therapy.

But one positive came out of it: a new respect for life. She went back to school to become a teacher. “And I just decided that ... if I could get through it, I could get through anything.”

___

I’ve been through enough life changes to know that it alters your perspective like that. But I know I haven’t settled into a great place with death. And I am guilty of expecting too much from medicine.

My encounter with the finch crystalized my problem with death. In my mind, I’d failed at saving this little bird that needed my help. But he likely would have died anyway.

I just hope the quiet shade he had in his final moments was better than dying in the sun on a piece of concrete. I will choose to hold onto that, in light of my new self-knowledge. Death may be inevitable, but allowing it to conquer my life is not.

Newly Released FBI Documents Show Troubling Double Standard on Political Speech,176,jlu28l,https://www.lawfareblog.com/newly-released-fbi-documents-show-troubling-double-standard-political-speech,22,1604222441.0,,"This morning, we received more than 30 pages of material from the FBI illustrating a remarkable disparity in its treatment of its employees: Five employees, the documents show, have been disciplined for private communications using government devices in which they have criticized President Trump. But none, at least not since 2011, has been disciplined for similar conduct with respect to presidential candidates Hillary Clinton or Mitt Romney, or President Barack Obama—or for praising Trump.

It’s not because politically loaded communications with respect to those political figures have not taken place among agents and other employees. At least with respect to enthusiasm for Trump and opposition to Clinton four years ago, the Justice Department inspector general has found communications that arguably imply similar bias by people working on campaign-related investigations:

On November 9, the day after the election, the [Supervisory Special Agent (SSA) for a Confidential Human Source (CHS)] contacted another FBI employee via an instant messaging program to discuss some recent CHS reporting regarding the Clinton Foundation and offered that “if you hear talk of a special prosecutor … I will volunteer to work [on] the Clinton Foundation.” The SSA’s November 9, 2016 instant messages also stated that he “was so elated with the election” and compared the election coverage to “watching a Superbowl comeback.” The SSA explained this comment to the [Office of the Inspector General] by saying that he “fully expected Hillary Clinton to walk away with the election. But as the returns [came] in ... it was just energizing to me to see ... [because] I didn’t want a criminal to be in the White House.” On November 9, 2016, the Handling Agent and co-case Handling Agent for this CHS also discussed the results of the election in an instant message exchange that reads: Handling Agent: “Trump!” Co-Case Handling Agent: “Hahaha. Shit just got real.” Handling Agent: “Yes it did.” Co-Case Handling Agent: “I saw a lot of scared MFers on ... [my way to work] this morning. Start looking for new jobs fellas. Haha.” Handling Agent: “LOL”

We also have trouble imagining that Barack Obama entirely escaped such disparagement on government devices during his two terms in office.

Yet the only cases in which people are known to have been disciplined for such conduct involved political criticism of President Trump—most notably the firing of former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who exchanged text messages critical of candidate Trump with FBI lawyer Lisa Page during the 2016 election. Was this because the similar messages involving other recent presidential candidates were not made public by the Justice Department, as Strzok’s were? Or was it because the FBI has had something of a double standard in meting out discipline for such indiscretions?

The verdict is now in, at least for the past four major-party presidential candidates, one of whom served as president of the United States for eight full years. FBI employees who voiced political sentiments in favor of or opposed to Clinton, Obama and Romney did not face consequences—nor did those who praised Trump. Those who criticize the current president appear to be the only people subject to discipline.

As Lawfare readers may recall, we first requested the documents in question in August 2019—and then brought suit in December 2019 after the FBI failed to respond to our request. Aided by our pro bono counsel, Robert Litt and Sophie Cash of Morrison & Foerster, we requested a carefully structured set of documents: any records from the FBI’s Case Management System—an internal database used to track disciplinary cases—of cases in which an FBI employee was accused of or became the subject of disciplinary measures for positive or negative statements regarding Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, dating back to November 2011. Our logic was that this should cover any recent cases in which FBI employees were considered for or received disciplinary action as a result of improper political statements about people in circumstances similar to the one Trump was in during the time of Strzok and Page’s conversations: a presidential candidate for one of the two major parties. We also filed a backstop request seeking underlying records on any such disciplinary action held by relevant offices within the FBI, as well as any information on the overall number of comparable cases.

These Freedom of Information Act requests were prompted by an allegation Strzok made in his lawsuit against the Justice Department about viewpoint discrimination in FBI discipline with respect to Trump:

During the Trump Administration ... viewpoint discrimination has infected the FBI. ... While Special Agent Strzok and others who expressed negative opinions of President Trump have been subject to administrative punishments of various degrees of severity, no actions have been taken against agents who expressed harsh criticism of Secretary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, or those in the New York Field Office who leaked negative information about Secretary Clinton to the Trump campaign in the weeks before the election.

This allegation turns out to be true, though proving it required litigation on our parts. It also required persistence on the part of our lawyers to get this material prior to Election Day, which the FBI seemed curiously keen to get past before validating Strzok’s claim.

We received our first set of responsive documents this past summer. It consisted of five summary “precedent reports” from a database that appears to have been maintained by the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). Four of the reports were almost entirely redacted on personal privacy grounds, but they all related to FBI Offense Code 5.22 (unprofessional conduct while on duty), were closed out in the summer of 2018 (three on July 18, one on August 22) and resulted in either 10- or 14-day suspensions. The fifth entry was largely unredacted and—while the case summaries are stripped of identifying information—clearly involved Strzok based on the conduct alleged, the back-and-forth regarding punishment, and the ultimate disciplinary action issued by the FBI brass in lieu of the OPR’s recommendation. (In Strzok’s case, the OPR recommended that he be demoted and suspended for 60 days, but FBI leadership overrode this and fired Strzok instead.)

This material was interesting and suggestive, but it was not dispositive. At a minimum, it was notable that no FBI employees had been punished for comparable conduct prior to 2018. And based on the dates alone, the material strongly implied that these cases related to Trump, who was the only political figure of the four about whom we inquired who was still in the news regularly during that period. This was especially true because a recent report by the FBI’s Office of the Inspector General had identified a similar number of FBI employees who had also made comments critical of Trump through work channels during the Clinton email investigation.

Absent the redacted information, however, we couldn’t be sure of who the people identified were or what they had said—and thus whether the manner in which they were punished reflected anything about their viewpoints. Consequently, we refrained from publishing this material until we secured additional documents that could clarify what these records meant.

Subsequent negotiations ultimately led to today’s production. For reasons of privacy, we are not going to publish these documents themselves. While heavily redacted, they contain information about career employees of the FBI that, we fear, could lead to their public identification and harassment. One of those employees is clearly Strzok. Another appears to be the FBI lawyer discussed in Office of the Inspector General reports as having altered an email during the investigation of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page—an offense to which former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith later pleaded guilty. The other three, however, are not people whose names have been made public in either litigation or other proceedings. What’s more, we are not confident that all of these records reflect final judgments; there may still be appeals pending or even resolved. (Lisa Page resigned without any disciplinary finding against her, so none of these additional cases involves a finding against her.)

The 30 pages we received consist of excerpts from five letters outlining the factual allegations behind disciplinary actions against five FBI employees. All personal identifiable information is once again redacted (as it should be), but the dates of the letters and the offense codes referenced line up with the original OPR summaries we received. The letters suggest that all five employees were involved to some degree in the investigation into Clinton’s emails. The disciplinary actions appear to have arisen from messages exchanged by the five individuals over email, text or the FBI’s internal messaging system.

It’s not clear from the letters precisely what these communications said, since much of the material is redacted—though the inspector general’s report details exchanges at some length that may well cover some of the same ground as is redacted in these letters. Among the messages we can see are several that are critical of the Trump campaign and of Trump the candidate. At times, the individuals in question also express frustration with their colleagues, their supervisors, the Justice Department and their roles in the investigation. After the 2016 election, several express dismay at what they perceived to be their own roles in Trump’s victory.

Most of the messages are the type of exchange you might expect to see between friends who share political views—though it is unnerving to see such comments from people who are working a relevant case. A few make remarks that could be perceived as more actively partisan, such as the infamous “Viva le Resistance” remark many attribute to Clinesmith—but in the context we can see, these seem to be expressions of sarcasm or gallows humor. Having these sorts of personal conversations on work communications platforms is undoubtedly ill-considered, and may indeed have violated the FBI’s policies in a manner that warrants a degree of disciplinary action. Yet we doubt it’s the sort of conduct that’s isolated to these five individuals in this small slice of the nearly 10-year period for which we requested records. The fact that these types of comments may have been inappropriate doesn’t alone explain why these five people are the ones—and apparently the only ones—who have been punished for such conduct.

What we do know is that all five of these cases involve FBI employees who worked on the Clinton email investigation and used government devices to make negative remarks about Trump. None involves people expressing enthusiasm about Trump. Nobody, it appears, has been subjected to discipline for, say, expressing eagerness to get assigned to an investigation of the Clinton Foundation or disparaging Clinton personally—even though the inspector general report shows that other FBI employees made such comments. And apparently, over the course of the Obama presidency, nobody ever used FBI devices to make disparaging remarks about either Obama or his 2012 Republican opponent—or else nobody at the FBI thought that such comments warranted this sort of disciplinary action.

Asked for comment on the production, Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, emailed: “This confirms the double standard practiced in the Trump Administration. If you text something critical of the President, you are subject to discipline and punishment. But you can express support for President Trump or criticize his political opponents with impunity. This viewpoint discrimination is blatantly unconstitutional.”

Page’s attorney, Amy Jeffress, responded: “These records prove what we suspected: that the FBI applied one standard for critics of President Trump and another for everyone else. This unfair double standard pervaded the Justice Department too, leading [it] to violate Lisa's rights under the Privacy Act. We have sued them for this egregious violation and we expect to win.”

Federal District Judge Amy Berman Jackson recently rejected the government’s motion to dismiss and for summary judgment in both Strzok’s and Page’s lawsuits, meaning that both claims will be litigated on their merits. (Full disclosure: Both Lisa Page and Peter Strzok are personal friends of one of the authors.)

As for the FBI itself, we reached out to the press office for comment but have received no response so far. We will, of course, supplement this article with any statement the FBI provides.

In addition, it warrants mention, we also requested and sued for a copy of—and information relating to—a presentation we understand was given to members of the Senior Executive Service at the FBI that may have misrepresented certain aspects of Page’s and Strzok’s cases. Copies of several of the relevant PowerPoint slides were redacted on the grounds that they contained information about law enforcement techniques, but a slide on Strzok was left entirely intact, including with his name. A subsequent slide that seemed likely to relate to Page was redacted in its entirety on privacy grounds. We aren’t sure what explains this discrepancy in privacy standards, or the apparent gap between how Strzok’s information was handled here and in the initial OPR summary reports. We followed up seeking additional information, including a video recording of the presentation that we were told might exist. But we were ultimately told—somewhat implausibly, given that each appears to have received their own slide in the PowerPoint deck—that neither Page nor Strzok were discussed in the recording. Regardless, we’re still exploring our options in regard to those documents, and will keep Lawfare readers informed of any further developments.

People will come to their own conclusions about whether disciplinary action is appropriate for what amounts to politically loaded water-cooler conversation among people working a case about matters within the scope of their investigation. Reasonable minds will disagree on the subject. It’s actually a hard question what the rule should be. What isn’t a hard question is whether there should be one rule for comments about Donald Trump or for people who worked the Clinton email investigation and a completely different set of standards for everyone else.

That just seems like the FBI running scared of presidential tweets and congressional tantrums."
Costco drops Chaokoh coconut milk over allegations of forced monkey labor,21,jluqgl,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/31/business/costco-coconut-milk-monkey-labor-trnd/index.html,5,1604225280.0,,"(CNN) Costco has reportedly stopped purchasing Chaokoh coconut milk after PETA accused its manufacturer, the Thailand-based company Theppadungporn Coconut Co., of using forced monkey labor.

PETA investigators from its Asia division found cruelty to monkeys at farms and facilities used by Theppadungporn Coconut Co., according to the animal rights group.

""When not being forced to pick coconuts or perform in circus-style shows for tourists, the animals were kept tethered, chained to old tires, or confined to cages barely larger than their bodies,"" a PETA news release stated. ""One coconut farmer confirmed that when monkeys are terrified and try to defend themselves, handlers may have their teeth pulled out.""

PETA investigators from its Asia division found cruelty to monkeys at farms and facilities used by Theppadungporn Co., makers of Chaokoh coconut milk sold at retail stores, including Costco.

Chaokoh, one of the world leaders in coconut milk production and other coconut products, and Theppadungporn Coconut Co., have not responded to CNN's request for comment.

Theppadungporn told USA Today that it has audited coconut plantations using a third party and shared a copy of the 14-page ""Monkey-Free Coconut Due Diligence Assessment."" The report says 64 farms out of 817 were randomly selected and ""did not find the use of monkey for coconut harvesting.""

"911 Calls, Body Camera Footage Of Fatal Police Shooting Of Walter Wallace Jr. To Be Released Nov. 4",2,jl9ow6,https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/10/30/911-calls-body-camera-footage-of-fatal-police-shooting-of-walter-wallace-jr-to-be-released-nov-4/,6,1604136619.0,,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — The City of Philadelphia says it will release the body camera footage and 911 calls of the fatal police shooting of 27-year-old Walter Wallace Jr., but not right away. The bodycam footage of Monday’s shooting that was widely expected to be released Thursday, is now expected to be released Wednesday, Nov. 4.

The Wallace family is on board with it.

There has been civil unrest in the city since Monday, the day Wallace Jr. was shot and killed by police.

In a joint statement today, Mayor Jim Kenney, Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, District Attorney Larry Krasner and the Wallace family acknowledged the pain Philadelphians are feeling and say they hope by releasing the recordings next Wednesday, there will be enough time to calm tensions.

“The Wallace Family, the Mayor, District Attorney, and Police Commissioner have all agreed that releasing the body camera footage and 911 audio on Wednesday, November 4, by the close of business is in the best interest of our city and its residents. Philadelphians are experiencing an immense amount of pain, and significant unrest persists throughout the entire city,” the statement reads.

However, the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police is pushing for Krasner to release the bodycam and 911 recordings to the public, saying officers followed police department training and protocol.

“The officers were justified in their use of force under very difficult and stressful conditions, an armed man confronting them with a knife. For nearly 50 seconds, officers retreated and ordered the male to drop his knife more than 20 times,” FOP President John McNesby said in a statement.

They believe once the district attorney’s office releases the tapes, the city can begin the process of healing.

Those who have seen them say there are uncomfortable parts to see and hear before the shooting takes place.

“When I hear the officer say certain things that I think are very troubling, and I think even Mr. Krasner a couple of days before the family got a chance to watch the video, is on record as saying he saw the video and he was troubled with what he saw,” Wallace family attorney Shaka Johnson said.

As we wait another five days, Outlaw says bodycam footage can answer or leave more questions.

“It can answer a lot of unanswered questions or get ahead of the narrative that’s out there where there’s misinformation involved, and then I’ve also seen it go completely the opposite of that,” Outlaw said.

There are a lot of moving parts here. At first, the Wallace family questioned the DA’s decision, but they are now on board with releasing it next Wednesday, which is a day after the election and only days before the funeral.

LONDON (AP) — Sean Connery, the charismatic Scottish actor who rose to international superstardom as the suave secret agent James Bond and then abandoned the role to carve out an Oscar-winning career in other rugged roles, has died. He was 90.

Connery’s wife and two sons said he “died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by family” in the Bahamas, where he lived. Son Jason Connery said his father had been “unwell for some time.”

Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they were “devastated” by the news. They said Connery’s “gritty and witty portrayal of the sexy and charismatic secret agent” was largely responsible for the success of the film series.

“He was and shall always be remembered as the original James Bond whose indelible entrance into cinema history began when he announced those unforgettable words — ‘The name’s Bond... James Bond,’” they said in a statement.

Daniel Craig, the current Bond, said Connery “defined an era and a style” and that the “wit and charm he portrayed on screen could be measured in mega watts.”

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the country was mourning “one of her best loved sons.”

Connery, was a commanding screen presence for some 40 years. He was in his early 30s — and little known — when he starred in the first Bond thriller, 1962’s “Dr. No,” based on the Ian Fleming novel.

Condemned as immoral by the Vatican and the Kremlin, but screened at the White House for Bond fan John F. Kennedy, “Dr. No” was a box office hit and launched a franchise that long outlasted its Cold War origins.

United Artists couldn’t wait to make more films about the British secret agent, with ever more elaborate stunts and gadgets, along with more exotic locales and more prominent co-stars, among them Lotte Lenya and Jill St. John.

For decades, with actors from Connery to Craig in the leading role, filmgoers have loved the outrageous stunts, vicious villains and likable, roguish hero who enjoyed a life of carousing, fast cars, gadgety weapons, elegant clothes and vodka martinis (always shaken, not stirred).

Connery continued as Bond in “From Russia With Love,” “Goldfinger,” “Thunderball,” “You Only Live Twice” and “Diamonds Are Forever,” often performing his own stunts.

“Diamonds Are Forever” came out in 1971 and by then Connery had grown weary of playing 007 and feared he wasn’t being taken seriously despite his dramatic performances in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Marnie” and Sidney Lumet’s “The Hill.”

“I’d been an actor since I was 25, but the image the press put out was that I just fell into this tuxedo and started mixing vodka martinis,” he once complained.

When he walked away at age 41, Hollywood insiders predicted Connery would soon be washed up. Who would hire a balding, middle-aged actor with a funny accent?

Connery fooled them all, playing a wide range of characters and proving equally adept at comedy, adventure or drama. And age only heightened the appeal of his dark stare and rugged brogue; he set a celebrity record of sorts when at age 59 he was named People magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive.”

He won the affection of fans of the “Indiana Jones” franchise when he played Indy’s father opposite Harrison Ford in the third picture, 1989′s “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.” He turned in a poignant portrayal of an aging Robin Hood opposite Audrey Hepburn in “Robin and Marian” in 1976 and, 15 years later, was King Richard to Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood in “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.”

He was the lovable English con man who joined Michael Caine in swindling people in a distant land in “The Man Who Would Be King” and the bold Russian submarine commander in “The Hunt for Red October.”

Connery delivered a charming performance as a reclusive writer who mentors a teenage prodigy in 2000′s “Finding Forrester.”

He won his Oscar for supporting actor in 1987 for his portrayal of a tough Chicago cop who joins Elliot Ness’ crime-fighters in “The Untouchables.”

By then he was at peace with James Bond, and when he arrived onstage at the Oscars ceremony he declared, “The name’s Connery. Sean Connery.”

He kept his promise not to play Bond again until 1983, when he was lured back by an offbeat script about a middle-aged 007. Based on the only Fleming story that hadn’t been nailed down by the film empire Broccoli and Saltzman created, Connery took the role and helped produce the film. The result was “Never Say Never Again,” a title suggested by his wife, Micheline Roquebrune.

Even as the 007 films made him a millionaire, Connery tried often to separate his own personality from that of Bond.

“I’m obviously not Bond,” he once said. “And Bond is obviously not a human being. Fleming invented him after the war, when people were hungry for luxury, gourmet touches, exotic settings. Those were the things the English loved to read about following the privations of the war.”

The “real” Sean Connery had a troubled first marriage and a history of comments justifying domestic violence. In 1962, he married Diane Cilento, an actress best known for her role as Molly in “Tom Jones.” They had a son, Jason, who also became an actor, but the union proved tempestuous and ended in 1974.

Its impact lasted long after. Cilento would allege that he had physically abused her and Connery defended his behavior in interviews. In 1965, he told Playboy magazine that he did not find “anything particularly wrong about hitting a woman — although I don’t recommend doing it in the same way that you’d hit a man. An openhanded slap is justified — if all other alternatives fail and there has been plenty of warning.”

When Barbara Walters brought up those remarks in a 1987 interview, he said his opinion hadn’t changed because “sometimes women just won’t leave things alone.”

Connery was widely criticized, but still received numerous honors, including being chosen as commander (the same rank as Bond) of France’s Order of Arts and Literature and a Kennedy Center honoree in 1999. The following year Queen Elizabeth II proclaimed him a British knight, for services to film drama.

In 2005 he was chosen for a lifetime achievement award by the American Film Institute. Thomas Sean Connery was born Aug. 25, 1930, in Edinburgh, Scotland, the first of two sons of a long-distance truck driver and a domestic worker.

He left school at age 13 during World War II to help support his family.

“I was a milkman, laborer, steel bender, cement mixer— virtually anything,” he once said.

Weary of day labor, he joined the British navy and was medically discharged after three years. The ailment: stomach ulcers.

Back in Edinburgh, he lifted weights to build his body and compete in the Mr. Universe contest. He came in third, and briefly considered becoming a professional soccer player, but chose acting because he reasoned his career would last longer.

He got his first big break singing and dancing to “There is Nothing Like a Dame” in “South Pacific” on the London stage and in a road production before going on to act in repertory, television and B movies. He went to Hollywood for two early films, Disney’s “Darby O’Gill and the Little People” and “Tarzan’s Greatest Adventure.”

When he decided to become an actor, he was told that Thomas Sean Connery wouldn’t fit on a theater marquee so he dropped his first name.

Then came the audition that changed his life. American producers Albert “Cubby” Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had bought the film rights to a string of post-World War II spy adventure novels by Fleming. Connery was not their first choice for “Dr. No.”

The producers had looked to Cary Grant, but decided they wanted an actor who would commit to a series. The producers also realized they couldn’t afford a big-name star because United Artists had limited their film budget to $1 million a picture, so they started interviewing more obscure British performers.

Among them was the 6-foot-2 Connery. Without a screen test, Broccoli and Saltzman chose the actor, citing his “dark, cruel good looks,” a perfect match for the way Fleming described Bond. When Connery started earning big money, he established his base at a villa in Marbella on the Spanish coast.

He described it as “my sanitarium, where I recover from the madness of the film world.” It also helped him avoid the overwhelming income tax he would have paid had he remained a resident of Britain.

As his acting roles diminished when he reached his 70s, Connery spent much of his time at his tax-free home at Lynford Cay in the Bahamas. He played golf almost every morning, often with his wife. He announced in 2007 that he had retired when he turned down the chance to appear in another “Indiana Jones” movie.

“I thought long and hard about it, and if anything could have pulled me out of retirement it would have been an `Indiana Jones’ film,” he said.

“But in the end, retirement is just too damned much fun.”

Though he lived abroad for many years, Connery was a passionate supporter of Scottish independence, a donor to the Scottish National Party and had the words “Scotland Forever” tattooed on his arm.

Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister, said “Sean was a global legend but, first and foremost, he was a patriotic and proud Scot.”

“He was a lifelong advocate of an independent Scotland and those of us who share that belief owe him a great debt of gratitude,” she said.

Craig, whose latest Bond film “No Time To Die” has been delayed into next year because of the coronavirus pandemic said Connery will continue to influence actors and film-makers alike for years to come.

“Wherever he is, I hope there is a golf course,” Craig said.

Connery is survived by his wife, brother Neil and sons Jason and Stefan. His publicist, Nancy Seltzer, said there would be a private ceremony followed by a memorial service once the coronavirus pandemic has ended.

But the veteran congresswoman said there are still skilled operatives in her district who excel at turnout work who have yet to get approved by the campaign, a puzzling delay for an operation that raised a record $363 million the month before.

“I screamed. Hollered. I called. I lobbied from the top to the bottom,” Wilson said of her efforts to get turnout operations started in the community, including sending written proposals to Biden’s campaign and having virtual Zoom meetings with his advisers.

In a sign of the state’s importance, Biden and Trump both campaigned in Florida on Thursday. Biden held an event in Broward County, which is located within the Miami-Fort Lauderdale media market, and then held a rally in Tampa , where Trump held his own event to boost early voting turnout.

Wilson and other Democrats aren’t panicking yet. They take comfort in the fact that huge swaths of Democratic voters cast absentee ballots by mail statewide, and that Biden narrowly leads in most Florida polls, including a Monmouth University likely voter survey released Thursday that put the former vice president up by 6 percentage points. That margin is far bigger than in Democratic internal polls.

Party officials also point out that Black churches are planning “Souls to the Polls” events Sunday that encourage voting after church. However, in the era of coronavirus, church services are virtual and organizing those events is more difficult than in the past election years.

The NAACP is helping Wilson produce a video for the virtual church services that talks about the dual threats of coronavirus and not voting.

“There is not the turnout here [Miami] in the black community that I’ve seen in the past. I can speculate about the reasons, but the fact is it remains concerning,” said state Sen. Oscar Braynon, a Black Miami Democrat who held a get-out-the-vote event Wednesday with rapper Fat Joe Wednesday.

To date, Republicans have turned out 59 percent of their voters in Miami-Dade and Democrats have turned out 53 percent, a 6-point margin. That’s twice the margin Republicans had at this point in 2016.

Among Hispanic voters, who make up nearly 70 percent of the county’s population, the deficit is even bigger — 9 points.

“Democrats have a big turnout issue in the Hispanic community in Miami-Dade,” said Florida-based Democratic data analyst Matt Isbell. “Hispanic Democrat turnout is only 48% while the Republican Hispanics are at 57%. This large of a gap doesn't exist in Broward or Orange. It is a Miami problem.”"
Internal Documents Reveal COVID-19 Hospitalization Data The Government Keeps Hidden,81,jkzoxo,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/30/929239481/internal-documents-reveal-covid-19-hospitalization-data-the-government-keeps-hid,3,1604103125.0,,"Internal Documents Reveal COVID-19 Hospitalization Data The Government Keeps Hidden

As coronavirus cases rise swiftly around the country, surpassing both the spring and summer surges, health officials brace for a coming wave of hospitalizations and deaths. Knowing which hospitals in which communities are reaching capacity could be key to an effective response to the growing crisis. That information is gathered by the federal government — but not shared openly with the public.

NPR has obtained documents that give a snapshot of data the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services collects and analyzes daily. The documents — reports sent to agency staffers — highlight trends in hospitalizations and pinpoint cities nearing full hospital capacity and facilities under stress. They paint a granular picture of the strain on hospitals across the country that could help local citizens decide when to take extra precautions against COVID-19.

Withholding this information from the public and the research community is a missed opportunity to help prevent outbreaks and even save lives, say public health and data experts who reviewed the documents for NPR.

""At this point, I think it's reckless. It's endangering people,"" says Ryan Panchadsaram, co-founder of the website COVID Exit Strategy and a former data official in the Obama administration. ""We're now in the third wave, and I think our only way out is really open, transparent and actionable information.""

The documents show that detailed information hospitals report to HHS every day is reviewed and analyzed — but circulation seems to be limited to a few dozen government staffers from HHS and its agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, according to distribution lists reviewed by NPR. Only one member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Adm. Brett Giroir, appears to receive the documents directly.

""Our goal is to be as transparent as possible, while still protecting privacy,"" an HHS spokesperson wrote in an email to NPR. ""HHS and the White House Coronavirus Task Force utilize hospital capacity data to gain greater insights into how COVID-19 is spreading and impacting the population, and to better inform response efforts like staff deployments and supply shipments.""

What data is being collected and shared internally?

The daily reports show county, city and hospital-level details, as well as national analyses that HHS does not post online.

For instance, the most recent report obtained by NPR, dated Oct 27, lists cities where hospitals are filling up, including the metro areas of Atlanta, Minneapolis and Baltimore, where in-patient hospital beds are over 80% full. It also lists specific hospitals reaching max capacity, including facilities in Tampa, Birmingham and New York that are at over 95% ICU capacity and at risk of running out of intensive care beds.

In reviewing the analysis obtained by NPR, Panchadsaram says the local and hospital-level data HHS is collecting would be very useful to researchers and health leaders. ""That stuff isn't easy to find at a national level,"" he says. ""There's no one place [publicly] you can go to get all that data.""

Hospitalization data is invaluable in looking ahead to see where and when outbreaks are getting worse, says Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. ""Right now, as we head into the fall and winter surge,"" Murray says, ""we're trying to put more emphasis on predicting where systems will be overwhelmed.""

But what's missing for this kind of planning, he says, is ""exactly the information"" that appears in the internal report.

NPR has reviewed several of these reports generated in the past month. They present trends in hospital use, including increases in ventilator usage, along with a growing number of inpatient and ICU beds being occupied by COVID-19 patients. The Oct. 27 report showed that all three measures have increased by 14%-16% in the past month.

About 24% of U.S. hospitals are using more than 80% of their ICU capacity, based on reporting from nearly 5,000 ""priority facilities,"" and more hospitals have joined their ranks in recent weeks.

Researchers say observing these trend lines can help the nation know how to prepare for surge and be ready to intervene before systems become overwhelmed.

Daily hospitalization numbers in particular are key measures for tracking pandemic hotspots, Murray says, because they reflect the number of severe COVID-19 cases in a community.

""The best possible measure of where we are in the pandemic, and the one we would want to anchor modeling to, is daily hospitalizations,"" he says, which give an early warning of deaths that will likely follow.

Panchadsaram's data-tracking site COVID Exit Strategy pulls state-level hospital capacity estimates from HHS when they're updated, which generally happens once a week. In reviewing the reports obtained by NPR, Panchadsaram says it's clear that vital data is flowing into HHS daily. ""But sharing with the public seems to be an afterthought,"" he says.

Gaps in transparency for state and local leaders

HHS tells NPR that more than 800 state-level employees have access to the daily hospitalization data it gathers, but only for their own state, unless another state grants them permission to view its data.

Without a larger view into national or regional data, some states — like Tennessee, which has eight bordering states — are missing out on valuable regional data, says Melissa McPheeters, who directs the Center for Improving the Public's Health through Informatics at Vanderbilt University.

""Hospitals in Tennessee serve patients who are from Arkansas and Mississippi and Kentucky and Georgia and vice versa, and so we're a little bit blind to what's going on there,"" she says. ""When we see hospitals that are particularly near those state borders having increases, one of the things we can't tell is: Is that because hospitals in an adjacent state are full? What's going on there? And that could be a really important piece of the picture.""

Lisa M. Lee, former chief science officer for public health surveillance at the CDC, now at Virginia Tech, says the federal government could help states work together across borders.

""It's very challenging for states to get the multistate view of things,"" she says. ""It's just a lot easier when there's a knowledgeable third-party who can pull the data together, make them consistent across states and actually tell the story of what the information shows."" Typically, she says, this role would be fulfilled by the CDC, but the agency was stripped of its role in collecting COVID-19 hospital data in July.

This kind of visibility into data could help policymakers decide how best to curb the spread of the virus. McPheeters and colleagues at Vanderbilt put out a report this week that found that Tennessee counties without mask mandates had more rapid increases in hospitalizations. That kind of analysis and insight would be possible at a much larger scale if HHS shared more granular hospitalization data, she says.

It could influence behavior among the public, says Lee. ""The neighborhood data, the county data and metro-area data can be really helpful for people to say, 'Whoa, they're not kidding, this is right here,'"" she says. ""It can help public health prevention folks get their messages across and get people to change their behavior.""

A controversial data switch

Experts who reviewed the internal documents for NPR say that even for the limited group of federal employees who get them, the daily reports are not as useful as they could be.

""We're so focused on counting things but not contextualizing them,"" explains McPheeters. A community hospital might become overwhelmed at a different point than a big academic hospital, and without that context, she says, it's impossible to tell: ""Is 75% [full] a good thing or is 75% a bad thing?""

Health data experts NPR consulted had ideas on how to improve the analysis. For instance, Panchadsaram suggested that some of the county-level charts, currently presented as raw numbers, would be more useful if analyzed per capita. ""You really need to adjust it to the number of people [in an area] to get a sense of where things are being overwhelmed,"" he says.

And the quality of the underlying data is a concern. Health experts say the data quality was compromised by a controversial shift in data collection from the CDC to HHS in July, and that the issues with data quality have not been fully resolved.

Hospitals have had to adjust to onerous new reporting requirements, and the hospital data is no longer checked and analyzed by seasoned epidemiologists and other experts at CDC.

The daily trend documents circulated at HHS include this disclaimer: ""This analysis depends on the data reported by hospitals. To the extent that the data is missing or inaccurate, this analysis will also reflect those issues.""

According to HHS data posted on Monday, just 62% of the nation's hospitals reported all the required information last week.

But greater transparency, even of incomplete data, can be invaluable in a crisis, experts say.

HHS told NPR that since it took over collecting hospital capacity data, it has ""consistently displayed state-level hospitalization data to help inform the public about COVID-19 prevalence in their communities.""

But public health experts say the state level data isn't detailed enough — and since the government is putting the effort into generating more granular daily analyses, it should share them.

""Even though they're collecting all these things and putting so much effort behind it, it gets blocked when it tries to get out of the door,"" Panchadsaram says."
Positive Trump polls spark polling circle debate - “there is a hidden Trump vote that is not being accounted for in polls”,295,jkwi01,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/523426-positive-trump-polls-spark-polling-circle-debate?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral,139,1604092390.0,,"Most pollsters show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden Joe BidenHouse Democrat touts resolution to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress Science denialism in the new administration Jill Biden to offer input on helping reunite separated immigrant families: report MORE with a sturdy and stable lead over President Trump Donald TrumpFBI says California extremist may have targeted Newsom House Democrat touts resolution to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress Facebook to dial back political content on platform MORE at a time when tens of millions of people have already voted and there is almost no time to change the course of the race.

But a handful of contrarian pollsters believe Trump’s support is underrepresented and that election analysts could be headed for another embarrassing miss on Election Day.

The battles have spilled on to social media, where some well-known political analysts have dismissed polls that show Trump leading Biden.

The Trafalgar Group, which was the only nonpartisan outlet in 2016 to find Trump leading in Michigan and Pennsylvania on Election Day, shows Trump with small leads in both states, which would be keys to another Trump win in the Electoral College. Nearly every other pollster shows Biden with a comfortable lead.

Trafalgar’s Robert Cahaly says there is a hidden Trump vote that is not being accounted for in polls that show Biden on a glide path to the White House.

“There are more [shy Trump voters] than last time and it’s not even a contest,” Cahaly said, adding that it’s “quite possible” that the polling industry is headed for a catastrophic miss in 2020.

FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver and Cook Political Report editor Dave Wasserman are among those deeply skeptical of Cahaly’s polling.

Both have dug into the crosstabs of Trafalgar polls and pointed to questionable breakdowns as evidence Trafalgar doesn’t know what it’s doing. For instance, the crosstabs in a Michigan poll, which are no longer online, appeared to show Trump leading Biden by 8 points among young voters, a Democratic stronghold.

“[Trafalgar] doesn't disclose their ‘proprietary digital methods’ so I can't really evaluate what they're doing,” said Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster with North Star Opinion Research. “They're far enough out on a limb that a year from now, we'll all remember if they were very right or very wrong.”

FiveThirtyEight’s model gives Trump about an 11 percent chance of winning — roughly equal to pulling an inside straight in poker — after giving him about a 30 percent chance on Election Day in 2016.

Biden appears to have a more comfortable lead in the polls than Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonHouse Democrat touts resolution to expel Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress Hillary Clinton says Greene should 'be on a watch list,' not in Congress DOJ: Social media influencer charged with interference in 2016 election MORE had at this point in 2016. Polls show Trump is underperforming — in some cases dramatically — among the key coalitions that powered his 2016 victory. Biden is also a more popular candidate than Clinton.

McHenry said he does not think there are many “shy” Trump supporters who would lie about their intentions.

Rather, there is concern about a “skewed response rate pattern,” whereby Trump voters would be less likely to participate in a survey or answer the phone when a pollster calls.

Still, McHenry noted that this wouldn’t be an automatic benefit for Trump. In Pennsylvania, for instance, he found Democrats were less likely to answer the phone than their registration would suggest.

“I can't definitively say there is no response bias, but I'm skeptical of it, and it certainly wouldn't be enough to explain the national deficits we're seeing,” he said.

That said, Trafalgar is not the only contrarian voice in polling. Several other pollsters have joined it in arguing that other pollsters are missing pro-Trump voters.

Jim Lee of Susquehanna Polling and Research has been another proponent of the “submerged” Trump voter theory.

A recent Susquehanna survey of Wisconsin found Trump and Biden tied, making it the only poll to not show Biden in the lead in the Badger State since August, when the Trafalgar Group found Trump ahead by 1 point. In Florida, Susquehanna shows Trump leading by 4 points, while the FiveThirtyEight average gives Biden a 2-point advantage.

“There are a lot of voters out there that don't want to admit they are voting for a guy that has been called a racist. That submerged Trump factor is very real,” Lee said this week on WFMZ’s Business Matters. “We have been able to capture it and I’m really disappointed others have not.”

The University of Southern California’s Dornsife Center is publishing results from its regular national poll but is also using parallel “experimental” questions asking people who they think their social contacts are voting for and who they think will win their home state.

In 2016, USC-Dornsife made headlines for being one of the few polls to show Trump leading nationally. Clinton ended up winning the national popular vote and USC later adjusted its methodology, saying it oversampled rural voters in the last election.

ADVERTISEMENT

This time around, the USC-Dornsife poll shows Biden leading by 11 points nationally.

However, the race tightens to 5 points when voters are asked about their social circles and to 1 point when voters are asked who they expect others in their state will vote for. That survey suggests Trump would once again win the Electoral College in 2020.

USC-Dornsife notes that the social circle question was a better indicator than the “own intention” question in five recent elections, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the 2018 battle for the House.

Still, the Santa Fe Institute’s Mirta Galesic, one of the researchers studying the added polling questions for USC, noted that the poll’s state-level findings suggesting Trump will win the Electoral College should be viewed with skepticism.

The USC-Dornsife poll of 5,000 national participants has very small samples in some of the battleground states and could be less accurate than public state polls.

“We anticipate that with such small samples, the social-circle question will produce more accurate state-level predictions than the own-intention question, because the social-circle question may provide more information and smooth out some of the bias of the small state sample,” Galesic said. “But this does not mean that predictions based on the social-circle question will be more accurate than large state polls.”

In addition, Galesic says the social terrain is extremely volatile due to the coronavirus pandemic, making it more difficult to gather reliable data about voters' social circles, which have shrunk dramatically in recent months.

And Galesic said the specter of 2016 still colors what many voters think they know about how their friends and family will vote in 2020, even if the dynamics have changed dramatically in that time.

“This incites a lot of pessimism among Democrats about Biden's chances and optimism among Republicans about Trump's chances,” Galesic said. “It also contributes to the belief that there are some Trump voters that are not accounted for in polls. Taken together, these beliefs could bias social-circle expectations towards a more narrow margin between the two candidates.”"
Republicans are narrowing the early voting gap in these states,10,jkrc7t,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/29/politics/republicans-democrats-early-voting/index.html,9,1604066144.0,,"(CNN) In four key states -- Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and Iowa -- Republicans are beginning to narrow the Democratic advantage in pre-Election Day voting .

More than 12 million ballots have been cast in these four states, which could be crucial in determining the next president.

The candidates' schedules reflect the focus on these states. President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden were both in Florida on Thursday campaigning for the state's 29 electoral votes. Later, Trump was set to travel to North Carolina, while Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled for campaign stops in Iowa and Nevada. Biden is due in Iowa on Friday.

With five days until November 3, here's a deeper look at who's already voted in these key states, with data from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations

Florida

Trump won Florida by slightly over one percentage point last cycle.

In the last week, voters under 30 have slightly increased their share of Florida's early voting electorate, from 8% to 10%. Other age groups have also seen small increases, further diminishing the dominance of Florida's senior voters 65 or older, who made up 45% of early voters a week ago, but now make up only 39%.

Florida's early voting electorate is slightly more diverse than at this time four years ago. Hispanic voters' share of the pre-Election Day vote has increased from 14% four years ago to 16% now, and Black voters' share has ticked slightly up from 12% then to 13% now. The vote from White voters is down three points from this point in 2016.

Republicans are narrowing the gap in pre-election ballots cast. Democrats currently lead by four points. A week ago, it was nine points. Party advantage is not predictive of outcome -- but nationwide polling shows many Republicans also prefer voting in person on Election Day rather than early.

North Carolina

Trump won the Tar Heel State by more than three percentage points in 2016.

Young people are continuing to vote in large numbers in North Carolina. Last week, voters under 30 made up about 11% of early voters but that's now ticked up slightly to over 12%.

Democrats have lost some of their lead in the pre-election vote. Last week, they had a 12-point advantage over Republicans in ballots cast. Currently, it stands at eight points.

By race, White voters account for the majority of ballots already cast in North Carolina at 72%, followed by Black voters with the second largest share of those ballots at 22%. This remains nearly identical to the racial composition of the early voting electorate four years ago.

Iowa

Iowa remains a competitive battleground this cycle after Trump won the Hawkeye State by more than nine percentage points in 2016. The state also has a key Senate race between incumbent Republican Joni Ernst and Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield.

Democrats continue to cast pre-election ballots at a much higher rate than Republicans, similar to 2016. At 49% of the pre-election vote, Democrats have a 17-point lead over Republicans, who stand at 32%. Republicans, however, have slightly narrowed that gap over the last week by four points.

By race, Iowa's current pre-Election Day electorate is similar to this point in 2016, with White voters comprising the vast majority of early voters at 94%.

Iowa hasn't seen as large a shift in age breakdown as some other states. Voters under 30 make up 10% of all early voters -- up only three points from this time four years ago. Voters 30-64 are up five points from 42% of turnout at this point four years ago to 47% now. Voters 65 and older make up a smaller share of early voters than at this point four years ago.

Nevada

Nevada had a narrow margin of defeat for Trump four years ago, with about two percentage points separating him from Hillary Clinton.

Nevada's early voting electorate is trending younger compared to the last week. Eleven percent of voters so far are under 30; last week it was only 9%. Voters 65 or older have gone from 40% of early voters last week to 35% now.

About two-thirds of Nevada's pre-election ballots come from White voters, which is a small decrease from 70% four years ago. Hispanic voters make up the second largest share of those ballots at 13%, a slight uptick from in 2016. Black voters and Asian voters have also seen one-percentage-point increases in their shares of the early vote.

Republicans are narrowing the Democratic advantage in the pre-election vote. Last week, Democrats led Republicans by 12 points. As more ballots have been returned in the vote-by-mail state, the 42% of ballots cast by Democrats is now only seven points higher than Republicans' 35%.

"USPS admits delivery times are plummeting, says there's no ""constitutional right"" to timely delivery",29,jkloo0,https://www.salon.com/2020/10/29/usps-admits-delivery-times-are-plummeting-says-theres-no-constitutional-right-to-timely-delivery/,4,1604043797.0,,"The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) argued that there is no ""constitutional right"" to timely mail delivery after its own data showed that on-time delivery times had plummeted ahead of Election Day.

The Department of Justice, which is defending the USPS in a lawsuit brought by New York and other states over changes ordered by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a top donor to President Donald Trump, argued that the mail slowdown cannot be unlawful because there is no guarantee in the Constitution of timely mail delivery, Bloomberg News reported.

Advertisement:

The states' argument ""assumes that because the plaintiff states crafted their election laws with the expectation that USPS will provide a certain level of service, they now have a constitutional right to expect that level of service,"" the DOJ said in a court filing, adding that the Elections Clause of the Constitution ""does not shield states from any and all external circumstances that may impact state elections.""

The filing came after New York Attorney General Letitia James warned that the USPS slowdown threatened the timely delivery of roughly 7 million ballots.

James argued that the slowdown violated the Elections Clause, because the USPS had taken ""actions that are intended to, and do, have the effect of hampering state election administration.""

Numerous federal courts have ordered the USPS to reverse changes ordered by DeJoy over the summer, which the agency's own inspector general faulted for reduced performance.

""No analysis of the service impacts of these various changes was conducted, and documentation and guidance to the field for these strategies was very limited and almost exclusively oral,"" the report said. ""The resulting confusion and inconsistency in operations at postal facilities compounded the significant negative service impacts across the country.""

Despite the court orders to restore mail-sorting machines and reverse rules limiting extra delivery trips, mail delivery times have gotten worse — not better. A judge ordered the USPS on Tuesday to inform all employees that DeJoy's policies had been reversed.

Advertisement:

The order came after the agency's own data showed that mail delivery had plummeted in recent weeks.

The data shows that the USPS delivered less than 70% of first-class mail on time on Wednesday, down from around 91% in the weeks before DeJoy's policy changes. In Southern Florida, only 63% of first-class mail was on time on Tuesday. In the Philadelphia areas, the USPS delivered only 42% of first-class mail on time. In the Baltimore area, that number fell to only 39%.

Though the USPS has processed election mail at a faster rate, voting rights advocates warned voters against sending ballots by mail in the final days before the election.

""It's too late to use the mails,"" former Attorney General Eric Holder, who now heads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, warned on Twitter. ""I urge everyone to now vote in person; early vote or use drop boxes. Protect your health but don't let the Court and the deliberately crippled Postal Service deprive you of your most precious civil right. Plan your vote.""

The USPS itself has also warned against sending ballots by mail in the final week before the election.

Advertisement:

""Our general recommendation is that as a common-sense measure, you mail your completed ballot before Election Day, and at least one week prior to your state's deadline,"" the agency wrote on its website.

Forty-two million out of 92 million mail ballots requested by voters still have not been returned despite the delivery window closing, according to the U.S. Elections Project. Accordingly, elections officials recommended submitting the ballots at drop boxes or voting in person rather than using the mail.

""We are too close to Election Day, and the right to vote is too important to rely on the Postal Service to deliver absentee ballots on time,"" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Citizens who already have an absentee ballot should sign the back of the envelope and hand-deliver it to their city or township clerk's office or ballot drop box as soon as possible.""

""Today is the last recommended day to mail back your ballot,"" Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said on Twitter. ""After today, return your ballot to any election drop box or voting location in your county."""
How a fake persona laid the groundwork for a Hunter Biden conspiracy deluge,173,jkpx8l,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/how-fake-persona-laid-groundwork-hunter-biden-conspiracy-deluge-n1245387,42,1604059468.0,,"One month before a purported leak of files from Hunter Biden's laptop, a fake ""intelligence"" document about him went viral on the right-wing internet, asserting an elaborate conspiracy theory involving former Vice President Joe Biden's son and business in China.

The document, a 64-page composition that was later disseminated by close associates of President Donald Trump, appears to be the work of a fake ""intelligence firm"" called Typhoon Investigations, according to researchers and public documents.

The author of the document, a self-identified Swiss security analyst named Martin Aspen, is a fabricated identity, according to analysis by disinformation researchers, who also concluded that Aspen's profile picture was created with an artificial intelligence face generator. The intelligence firm that Aspen lists as his previous employer said that no one by that name had ever worked for the company and that no one by that name lives in Switzerland, according to public records and social media searches.

One of the original posters of the document, a blogger and professor named Christopher Balding, took credit for writing parts of it when asked about it and said Aspen does not exist.

Despite the document's questionable authorship and anonymous sourcing, its claims that Hunter Biden has a problematic connection to the Communist Party of China have been used by people who oppose the Chinese government, as well as by far-right influencers, to baselessly accuse candidate Joe Biden of being beholden to the Chinese government.

The document and its spread have become part of a wider effort to smear Hunter Biden and weaken Joe Biden's presidential campaign, which moved from the fringes of the internet to more mainstream conservative news outlets.

An unverified leak of documents — including salacious pictures from what President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and a Delaware Apple repair store owner claimed to be Hunter Biden's hard drive — were published in the New York Post on Oct. 14. Associates close to Trump, including Giuliani and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, have promised more blockbuster leaks and secrets, which have yet to materialize.

The fake intelligence document, however, preceded the leak by months, and it helped lay the groundwork among right-wing media for what would become a failed October surprise: a viral pile-on of conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden.

Behind Typhoon

The Typhoon Investigations document was first posted in September to Intelligence Quarterly, an anonymous blog ""dedicated to collecting important daily news,"" according to its ""about"" section. Historical domain records show the blog was registered to Albert Marko, a self-described political and economic adviser, who also lists the blog on his Twitter bio. When asked about the provenance of the document, Marko said he received it from Balding.

Balding, previously an associate professor at Fulbright University Vietnam who studied the Chinese economy and financial markets, posted the document on his blog on Oct. 22, seven weeks after it was initially published.

""I had really not wanted to do this but roughly 2 months ago I was handed a report about Biden activities in China the press has simply refused to cover. I want to strongly emphasize I did not write the report but I know who did,"" Balding said in an email.

Balding later claimed to NBC News that he wrote some of the document.

""I authored small parts of the report and was involved in report preparation and review. As a researcher, and due to the understandable worry about foreign disinformation, it was paramount that the report document activity from acknowledged and public sources,"" Balding said. ""Great care was taken to document, cite, and retain information so that acknowledged facts could be placed in the public domain.""

A viral dossier about Hunter Biden was written by ""Martin Aspen,"" a fake identity whose profile picture was created by artificial intelligence. TyphoonInvesti1 / via Twitter

Balding said Aspen is ""an entirely fictional individual created solely for the purpose of releasing this report."" Balding did not name the document's main author, saying ""the primary author of the report, due to personal and professional risks, requires anonymity.""

Balding claimed that the document was commissioned by Apple Daily, a Hong Kong-based tabloid that is frequently critical of the Chinese government. A spokesperson for Apple Daily confirmed it had worked with Balding on the document.

In addition to posting the document to his blog, Balding also promoted it in far-right media, appearing on Bannon's podcast and on ""China Unscripted,"" a podcast produced by The Epoch Times, a pro-Trump media outlet opposed to the Chinese government.

Balding, an American who taught economics at China's Peking University HSBC Business School until 2018, is often critical of the Chinese government. He made news this year as a source uncovering a global bulk data collection operation by the Chinese company Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Technology.

Blog posts highlighting the most salacious parts of the document, including articles from the Intelligence Quarterly Blog, Revolver News and Balding's blog, received 70,000 public interactions — which includes reactions, comments and shares — across Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, according to the social media analysis tool BuzzSumo.

Balding's blog was the primary driver of virality in conservative and conspiracy communities. The report itself was shared across Facebook and Twitter around 5,000 times, according to BuzzSumo, and more than 80 sites linked back to the blog, which was shared more than 25,000 times on Facebook and Twitter. Hyperpartisan and conspiracy sites like ZeroHedge and WorldNetDaily led the pack.

After the promise of a big reveal one day earlier, the document was also posted on the extremist forum 8kun by Q, the anonymous account behind the QAnon conspiracy theory movement.

On Twitter, the document was pushed by influencers in the QAnon community, as well as by Dinggang Wang, an anti-Chinese government YouTube personality who works for Guo Wengui, a billionaire who fled China amid accusations of bribery and other crimes. Republican Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, tweeted the document to his 2.3 million followers.

'Immediately suspicious'

The document gained attention from disinformation researchers in part because of the image of the document's author.

Elise Thomas, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, first spotted telltale signs of a fake photo when she went searching for Typhoon Investigations' Aspen on the web. Thomas found a Twitter account for Aspen named @TyphoonInvesti1, which had posted a link to Typhoon's WordPress page that contained the document on Aug. 15.

The profile picture for Aspen immediately showed signs of being a computer-generated image that can be created by computers and even some websites. Aspen's ears were asymmetrical, for one, but his left eye is what gave away that he did not really exist. Aspen's left iris juts out and appears to form a second pupil, a somewhat frequent error with computer-generated faces.

""The most obvious tell was the irregular shape of the irises,"" Thomas said. ""The profile picture looks pretty convincing in the Twitter thumbnail, but when I popped it up into full view I was immediately suspicious.""

Thomas then consulted with Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at the analytics company Graphika, who noted the other telltale sign of a computer-generated face.

""One of the things he and his team have figured out is that if you layer a lot of these images over the top of one another, the eyes align,"" Thomas said. ""He did that with this image, and the eyes matched up.""

Other parts of Aspen's identity were clearly stolen from disparate parts of the web. Aspen's Facebook page was created in August, and it featured only two pictures, both from his ""new house,"" which were tracked back to reviews on the travel website Tripadvisor. The logo for Typhoon Investigations was lifted from the Taiwan Fact-Checking Center, a digital literacy nonprofit.

Aspen claimed on his LinkedIn profile to have worked for a company called Swiss Security Solutions from 2016 to 2020. Swiss Security Solutions denied having ever employed anyone named Aspen, and it said it had found fake accounts for two other people pretending to have worked for the company.

""Martin Aspen was never a freelancer or worker of the Swiss Security Solutions. We do not know this person. According to our Due Diligence Software, this person does not exist in Switzerland,"" Swiss Security Solutions Chairman Bojan Ilic said, adding that the company has reported the profile to LinkedIn.

Fake faces

Computer-generated faces have become a staple of large-scale disinformation operations in the run-up to the election. In December, Facebook took down a network of fake accounts using computer-created faces tied to The Epoch Times. Facebook removed over 600 accounts tied to the operation, which pushed pro-Trump messages and even served as moderators of some Facebook groups. Stephen Gregory, publisher of the U.S. editions of The Epoch Times, has denied any connection to the accounts.

Last month, Facebook removed another batch of computer-generated profiles originating in China and the Philippines, some of which made anti-Trump posts.

Renee DiResta, a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said computer-created identities are becoming common for disinformation campaigns, in part because they are easy to create.

DiResta, who helped examine a ring of AI-generated faces tied to the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA last month, said computer-generated profile pictures can be used to ""build an army of fake people"" to artificially support a cause or to make ""disinformation operations harder to discover.""

""One of the things that investigators look at to understand the narrative that is spreading is whether the accounts are authentic, whether they're real,"" DiResta said. ""If they were to use a stock photo, it confirms something dishonest is likely happening. By using an AI-generated face, you're guaranteeing you won't find that person elsewhere on the internet.""

FBI Investigating Hunter Biden for Money Laundering: Report,0,jkksca,https://news.yahoo.com/amphtml/fbi-investigating-hunter-biden-money-222323906.html?__twitter_impression=true,11,1604040808.0,,"The FBI opened an investigation into Hunter Biden and associates in 2019 on suspicion of money laundering, a Justice Department official told Sinclair Broadcasting.

The criminal investigation is ongoing, the DOJ official said.

The revelation comes after Tony Bobulinski, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, came forward with a trove of documents regarding the Biden family’s dealings with now-defunct Chinese energy firm CEFC. While Joe Biden has denied that he has ever spoken with Hunter regarding the latter’s overseas business dealings, Bobulinski claims the former vice president is lying.

EXCLUSIVE: Tony Bobulinski tells @WeAreSinclair he was questioned by six @FBI agents, with counsel present, for five hours on October 23, listing him as a ""material witness"" in an ongoing investigation focused on Hunter Biden and his associates. His cell phones were examined. pic.twitter.com/5lPzRTREJN — James Rosen (@JamesRosenTV) October 29, 2020

Additionally, Bobulinski told Sinclair that he was interviewed by FBI agents for five hours last Friday and was listed as a “material witness” for the agency.

The interview “was a very cooperative deep dive into all the facts across that time period” during which Bobulinski conducted business with members of the Biden family, Bobulinski said.

The New York Post reported earlier this month that it was given materials purportedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop. While a subsequent Fox News report revealed that Hunter Biden’s laptop was subpoenaed by the FBI in connection with a money laundering investigation, the Thursday report by Sinclair marks the first confirmation that Hunter Biden himself is the subject of an ongoing criminal probe.

The Biden campaign has not denied the veracity of any of the materials revealed by the Post or Bobulinski. However, the campaign has stated that “Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever.”

Turkish Bank Case Showed Erdogan’s Influence With Trump,81,jkcs7j,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/us/politics/trump-erdogan-halkbank.html?utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link&ICID=ref_fark,3,1604016172.0,,"WASHINGTON — ​Geoffrey S. Berman was outraged.

The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, Mr. Berman had traveled to Washington in June 2019 to discuss a particularly delicate case with Attorney General William P. Barr and some of his top aides: a criminal investigation into Halkbank, a state-owned Turkish bank suspected of violating U.S. sanctions law by funneling billions of dollars of gold and cash to Iran.

For months, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had been pressing President Trump to quash the investigation, which threatened not only the bank but potentially members of Mr. Erdogan’s family and political party. When Mr. Berman sat down with Mr. Barr, he was stunned to be presented with a settlement proposal that would give Mr. Erdogan a key concession.

Mr. Barr pressed Mr. Berman to allow the bank to avoid an indictment by paying a fine and acknowledging some wrongdoing. In addition, the Justice Department would agree to end investigations and criminal cases involving Turkish and bank officials who were allied with Mr. Erdogan and suspected of participating in the sanctions-busting scheme.

Mr. Berman didn’t buy it.

The bank had the right to try to negotiate a settlement. But his prosecutors were still investigating key individuals, including some with ties to Mr. Erdogan, and believed the scheme had helped finance Iran’s nuclear weapons program."
Americans plan widespread protests if Trump interferes with election,397,jkawq2,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-protests/americans-plan-widespread-protests-if-trump-interferes-with-election-idUSKBN27E1HB?il=0,142,1604010103.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dozens of activist groups who claim to represent millions of Americans from both political parties plan to hit the streets next week, if President Donald Trump appears to be interfering with vote counting or manipulating poll results after Election Day.

Slideshow ( 3 images )

The ""Protect the Results"" coalition of over 130 groups from Planned Parenthood to Republicans for the Rule of Law, has about 400 events protecttheresults.com planned to date. Participants are prepping to demonstrate ""as early as the afternoon on Wednesday, November 4,"" the day after Election Day, and await a SMS message.

“We can’t assume that Donald Trump will respect the peaceful transfer of power” said Sean Eldridge, the founder and president of Stand Up America, which started organizing the coalition in June.

If Trump tries to interfere in the counting of ballots, or pressures state or local officials to say ballots should no longer be counted “then we would mobilize,” he said.

Determining ahead of time, how, exactly, to define “interference” by the U.S. president is difficult, activists said, but it could include refusing to accept state vote tallies or prematurely declaring victory.

“We are very concerned that Trump is going to try to steal this election, using his position of power,” said Kaela Bamberger, an organizer with Shut Down DC, which plans civil action that may include stopping traffic in the U.S. capital, with dozens of other groups.

Lessons from other countries that have suffered coups show that “time is of the essence,” Bamberger said. “The longer the person claims to be in power and tries to force their position of power to be extended, the more likely it is there’s nothing to be done about it.”

Trump has not committed here to a peaceful transfer of power, instead warning, without evidence, of the possibility of fraud from mail-in ballots. Other Republicans have rejected here the idea that he won't step down if defeated.

Trump said this week a result should be announced on Tuesday, an unlikely scenario given the huge jump in mail-in ballots that need time to be counted because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“The President will accept the results of a free and fair election,” White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews said in response to questions about the activists’ plans.

“We Count on Us,” a coalition of student activists, plans hundreds of proactive, peaceful demonstrations at city halls and counting centers to “make sure no lines are crossed,” said Neha Desaraju of the Sunrise Movement, which is a part of the coalition.

Others are focused on keeping voters patient until results are announced.

The bi-partisan National Council on Election Integrity has spent $4.5 million on voting education ads, especially in some swing states, said spokesman Michael Beckel.

“Because of the pandemic, things look different this year, and that will require us to be more patient than usual,” Beckel said. Election experts in these states are already warning it could be days before results are known, he added."

Updated on Oct. 30 at 9:32 p.m.

This story was co-reported by Iowa Public Radio News, the Center for Public Integrity and NPR.

The New Hope Missionary Baptist Church in Waterloo. The senior high school in Fort Dodge. The Masonic Temple in Council Bluffs.

Iowa voters won't be able to cast their ballot at those locations this Election Day, or at many of the state's other usual polling places. Closures and consolidations have rippled across Iowa due to the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in hundreds fewer Election Day polling places than the state had in 2016.

Nonetheless, Iowa has already seen record turnout, with voters casting more absentee ballots than they ever have before. Early in-person voting has also been underway for weeks. But those who do want to cast a ballot in-person on Election Day should first check to see if their polling place has changed.

""All of us, we are going to have to look up where we need to go. I mean, I'm not sure which place I would go,"" said Sheena Thomas, a voter in Des Moines. ""That's going to be an issue for everybody.""

Thomas wasn't able to vote at her usual polling site this year, a senior care center on the west side of the city. She decided it would be easier to vote absentee instead.

""There's precinct numbers and House district numbers and there's Senate district numbers and which one of those is used for my polling place?"" she asked. ""I am pretty sure of its precinct number, but even so, that's not readily available in your head.""

Everything about the act of voting in 2020 has been shaken by COVID-19. A record number of ballots have been cast early, either by mail or in person. All over the country, sports teams are turning over their arenas to be used as large-scale, socially distanced polling places.

But in some states, the pandemic has also meant a reduction in the number of polling places, a potential roadblock for voters amid a period of already-heightened stress and confusion. (Find your polling place anywhere in the U.S. here or use Iowa's tool to find polling places in that state.)

Since the 2016 general election, Iowa has lost 261 polling places, according to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, Stateline and NPR. The polling place changes vary across the state; while some counties are able to keep all of their sites open, others must close or consolidate half.

Overall, this affects some 670,000 Iowans, 30% of the state's registered voters. Those affected by the changes overwhelmingly live in the state's urban areas, which reliably vote Democratic. And the closures are happening at a time of multiple competitive races in the state, including the presidential contest.

Pandemic sparks polling place consolidations

This spring, the pandemic prompted unprecedented polling place consolidations during the primaries in jurisdictions across the U.S., sparking an outcry over images of voters standing in hours-long lines in places such as Milwaukee and Atlanta.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for election administrators to ""maintain or increase the total number of polling places available to the public on Election Day to improve the ability to social distance."" The guidance also says to avoid increasing the number of potential registered voters assigned to each polling place ""unless there is no other option.""

The pandemic-related closures follow a scaling back of polling places across the country in recent years as some communities have begun voting primarily by mail or using larger ""vote centers,"" and in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited federal oversight of election administration.

In 2013, the court's Shelby County v. Holder decision struck down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required jurisdictions with a history of racially discriminatory practices to seek permission from the federal government before making changes to voting policies and procedure. Since then, voting rights advocates have expressed alarm about how polling place closures and relocations may impact communities of color in previously covered states and jurisdictions. Iowa wasn't covered.

In general, ""on Election Day, we can anticipate to see long lines in areas where there have been mass closures,"" said Leigh Chapman, director of the voting rights program at the Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights, which has issued reports on polling place closures in places affected by Shelby.

Despite advocates' efforts, local election officials in Iowa have struggled to find poll workers and been kicked out of churches and community centers that don't feel comfortable hosting voters during a pandemic.

""That's just the reality. Insufficient poll workers means less polling places,"" said Joel Miller, the top election official in Linn County, the state's second largest.

Miller has closed or consolidated 37% of his polling places this year.

""I know that may create additional hardships on it, but you know, there's a lot of people that could be volunteering to work the polls that are choosing not to and I understand,"" Miller said, ""but when we said that we need younger people to get involved and stand up this year, we weren't kidding.""

Many, if not most Iowans are expected to vote early or absentee this cycle and voters have already broken at least one turnout record.

But for those who want to vote in person on Election Day, research has shown that polling place closures, consolidations and relocations can depress turnout.

University of Northern Iowa political scientist Chris Larimer says that's a concern this cycle.

""If there's that big of an increase in those other forms of voting, absentee or early, is that enough to offset the consolidation of polling places? Or the closure of certain polling places?"" Larimer asked. ""I just don't think we know yet.""

Finding a new site can be time-consuming and confusing for voters. People with low incomes and people of color may be less able to overcome those barriers. Across the country, Black voters have faced longer wait times at the polls even before the pandemic.

""That's the concern, is voter suppression,"" Larimer said. ""And/or just adding costs to the act of voting, which is something we don't want to do, because it's already hard enough to get people to the polls.""

Diverse communities among those affected

The analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, Stateline and NPR found that in Black Hawk County, one of the state's most diverse areas, census tracts with more people of color lost a larger share of polling places than whiter census tracts.

Loading...

Black Hawk County Auditor Grant Veeder said he didn't account for demographics when he closed or consolidated 30% of his sites. His county includes the city of Waterloo, which is home to the state's largest Black population, proportionally.

""We really didn't use that kind of demographic information,"" Veeder said. ""We were just looking for the places that we needed to make combinations and tried to make as few of them as we could and spread them out as much as we could.""

Veeder, like many local election officials, is hoping Iowans take advantage of early and absentee voting, to prevent overcrowding and longer lines at the pared-back polling places.

The prospect of decreasing access to the polls in Black communities isn't exactly surprising for Vikki Brown, chair of the Black Hawk County Democrats.

""It seems that things have always been made harder for us. But we're resilient. And we always find a way to do what we need to do,"" Brown said. ""We overcome.""

Iowa voters do have other ways to cast their ballot. Early voting in the state began on Oct. 5 and every county has at least one early voting site. Additionally, no-excuse absentee voting is much more established here than in other states, with 40% of Iowa voters casting an absentee ballot during the 2016 election.

Overall, Iowans tend to vote at higher rates than residents of other states, with turnout often hitting 70% during presidential elections.

Despite everything, Brown is optimistic that voters will find a way, even during a pandemic.

""I'm certain that it's going to make it harder for people to vote. But I am seeing a resolve right now, where people are determined,"" Brown said. ""Whatever you do, we're going to counteract it.""

As of Friday, the state had received a record number of absentee ballots.

But how these polling place changes affect turnout could have effects beyond Iowa. Races for the White House, U.S. Senate and multiple House districts in Iowa have all been labeled toss-ups.

The races are so close, Larimer says the polling place changes could affect the outcome, especially down the ballot.

Kentucky AG office and officer in Breonna Taylor raid argue to keep investigative materials from public,305,jk3kah,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/28/us/breonna-taylor-investigation/index.html,18,1603974245.0,,"(CNN) The Kentucky Attorney General's Office and an attorney for the former police officer charged for his actions in connection with the raid that killed Breonna Taylor argued Wednesday to keep investigative materials from being released to the public.

The arguments comes as the Louisville Courier-Journal has intervened in the case, asking for discovery materials to be filed as part of the court's public record, and an attorney for the paper argued the public has a right to know how the case of former Louisville Metro Police Department officer Brett Hankison is being handled.

A grand jury indicted Hankison for first-degree wanton endangerment for allegedly shooting through Taylor's home into a neighbor's apartment. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Taylor, 26, was shot and killed by police in her home during a botched drug raid in March. The attorney general said that two officers who shot at Taylor, Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, were justified in their use of force because Taylor's boyfriend fired at them first, hitting Mattingly.

""I don't think it's an exaggeration to say the judicial system, in some sense, is on trial here,"" an attorney representing the Courier-Journal , Michael Abate, argued in court. ""The public has a right and need to see, not only the evidence in this case, but how the attorney general and the commonwealth have handled this case.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the presidential campaign (all times local):

8:35 p.m.

Joe Biden is getting a boost from Oprah Winfrey in the final days of the presidential campaign.

The Democratic nominee made a surprise appearance Wednesday on a virtual get-out-the-vote event hosted by Winfrey that focused on voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio.

While President Donald Trump won all but Minnesota in 2016, Democrats are increasingly optimistic Biden can win at least Michigan and Pennsylvania back, and he’s making a play for Ohio as well.

During the event, Biden spoke to Mildred Madison, a 94-year-old Michigan resident who drove over 600 miles to cast her vote in person after her absentee ballot never arrived.

He told Madison that her story “gives me that extra boost of hope and energy and optimism for the country.” Referencing his stump speech slogan that “we’re in a battle for the soul of America,” Biden told Madison, “You are the soul of America.”

Winfrey was an early high-profile endorser of Barack Obama, and her support helped boost him in the 2008 Democratic primary. But while she endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, she largely sat out of the campaign that year.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON:

8:20 p.m.

Kamala Harris is addressing President Donald Trump’s criticism of her while campaigning in Arizona, calling herself a “proud, patriotic American” in the spirit of the late Sen. John McCain.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Democratic vice presidential nominee said Wednesday during a car rally in Phoenix that “there’s been a lot of talk from the current occupant of the White House about my values.”

Trump has criticized Harris as a force of the “radical left” and a “socialist.” He’s also said it would be an insult for her to be the nation’s first female president.

Harris says one of the values Americans share is the knowledge that the commander in chief’s first priority should be the health of the nation’s people. She’s calling Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic “the greatest failure” of any administration in history.

She says, “I know that we are all prepared to stand for the democracy of our country and to stand for the country we love.”

6:35 p.m.

President Donald Trump says a former administration official who penned a scathing anti-Trump op-ed and book under the pen name “Anonymous” was a “sleazebag.”

Speaking at a rally in Goodyear, Arizona, soon after the former administration official, Miles Taylor, acknowledged he was the writer, Trump dismissed the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security as “a nobody, a disgruntled employee.”

In fact, Taylor was present at many White House meetings with Trump covering border policy and other major issues involving DHS.

Trump joked to the friendly crowd that he thought “Anonymous” might one of his senior advisers, naming Hope Hicks and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, or Republican Sens. Mike Lee or Rand Paul. The senators, close Trump allies, were on hand for Wednesday’s rally.

___

5:05 p.m.

A spokesperson for President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign says the revelation that Miles Taylor is “Anonymous” is the “least impressive, lamest political ‘reveal’ of all time.”

Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, revealed himself Wednesday to be the senior White House administration official known as “Anonymous” who wrote a scathing New York Times op-ed about Trump and a subsequent book, “A Warning.” As “Anonymous,” he claimed to be part of a “resistance” working “from within” to thwart Trump’s “worst inclinations.”

Taylor has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s in recent months and has a contributor contract on CNN.

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows says, “I’ve seen more exciting reveals in Scooby-Doo episodes. What a monumental embarrassment.”

Campaign spokesperson Hogan Gidley says he worked with DHS officials during his tenure at the White House and “even I had to research who Miles Taylor was.” Hogan points out that Taylor lied to Anderson Cooper on CNN in August when he denied being “Anonymous.”

4:25 p.m.

President Donald Trump paused a campaign speech in the battleground state of Arizona to admire a fighter jet flying by.

Trump said Wednesday as the jet roared by his rally in Bullhead City: “I love that sound.”

Trump, who identified the jet as an F-35, went back to his remarks briefly before the pilot offered a nifty maneuver that caught both Trump’s and the crowd’s eye again.

North American Aerospace Defense Command says the jet was an F-16 that released a flare to get the attention of a nonresponsive private aircraft that was flying in the restricted airspace near the president’s event. The organization says the private aircraft was escorted out of the area by the F-16 “without further incident.”

After the flare from the jet, the president once again offered his appreciation and segued into a dig on Democrats.

He says, “You know how hard it is to get Democrats to pay for that?”

3:40 p.m.

Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff, has announced that he is “Anonymous,” the senior White House administration official who claimed to be part of a “resistance” working “from within” to thwart President Donald Trump’s “worst inclinations.”

Taylor, an outspoken Trump critic, tweeted Wednesday that he wrote the 2018 op-ed in The New York Times and a subsequent book. Anonymous’ identity had been hidden until now.

Taylor writes in a statement six days before the election that he is a Republican and wanted Trump to succeed.

But he writes that, “too often in times of crisis, I saw Donald Trump prove he is a man without character, and his personal defects have resulted in leadership failures so significant that they can be measured in lost American lives.”

Taylor, who served as DHS chief of staff from 2017 to 2019, has already endorsed Democrat Joe Biden in the presidential race and created a group for former administration officials who are now public critics of the president.

He has accused Trump of using DHS for “political benefit” by focusing on issues that would help his campaign at the expense of more pressing matters.

The lease holder at a Reno airport hangar where Vice President Mike Pence plans a rally Thursday has signed an agreement that requires the Republican National Committee to adhere to all Nevada COVID-19 restrictions, including a 250-person attendance cap and mandatory masks.

The RNC also must provide proof of at least $1 million in liability insurance in addition to the lease holder’s $5 million policy to cover any damages, fines or legal actions. That’s according to a copy of the special use permit agreement that the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority provided The Associated Press on Wednesday.

The lease holder, longtime GOP donor Perry Di Loreto, signed the agreement Monday. That’s the same day Nevada fined a nearby county and airport more than $5,500 for allowing a campaign event for President Donald Trump that drew thousands of mostly unmasked people in September.

The 50-person cap in place at that time has since been raised to 250.

3 p.m.

If he wins the presidency, one of Joe Biden’s first moves will be to call foreign leaders and tell them “America is back.”

That’s what the Democratic presidential nominee told more than two dozen donors on a virtual fundraiser Wednesday. Biden said he would “literally” be on the phone with “key leaders in Europe and Asia” working to rebuild alliances and reassuring them that “you can take our word again.” He also indicated that some of those leaders have “been in contact with me the past year.”

Biden, a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was heavily engaged in foreign diplomacy during his time as vice president and has often expressed his desire to rebuild America’s standing globally, something he said Wednesday would be “a monumental task.”

Biden added that the coronavirus pandemic “only makes things more urgent” because “it’s laid bare just how critical global cooperation is.” He said he’d “mobilize the world to fight the defining threats of our time,” including nuclear proliferation, terrorism, the climate crisis, mass migration and “the disruptive impacts of new technologies.” Biden also pledged to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization.

2:40 p.m.

President Donald Trump is weighing in on two nights of clashes with Philadelphia police and store break-ins following the fatal shooting by police of Walter Wallace Jr.

Trump was asked Wednesday about the violence while speaking in Las Vegas during a campaign swing through Nevada and Arizona. Authorities in Philadelphia say Wallace, a Black man, ignored orders to drop a knife, while his family says he was experiencing a mental health crisis.

Trump says, “You can’t let that go on. Again, a Democrat-run state, a Democrat-run city, Philadelphia.”

Trump says the federal government is reviewing the shooting, too.

The president also claims police were told to stand back during rioting, but adds, “Maybe that’s not so, but that’s what I was told upon very good authority.”

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has also denounced the violence that occurred during some protests in response to the shooting. He says, “There is no excuse whatsoever for the looting and the violence.”

2:20 p.m.

Joe Biden will join forces with his old boss, former President Barack Obama, for a rally in Michigan on Saturday.

The Biden campaign announced the rally on Wednesday but hasn’t said where it will be held. Metro Detroit is the Democratic base of the state, with a prominent Black population in the city along with growing nonwhite populations. Democrats also made gains among suburban white voters in the 2018 midterms.

President Donald Trump won Michigan by just under 11,000 votes four years ago, making it his closest margin of victory in any state. He won the state through key gains across southwest Michigan in communities where Obama won or lost narrowly. Democratic support in and around Detroit also fell off from 2012 levels when Obama was reelected.

1:50 p.m.

Joe Biden is denouncing violence that occurred in some protests in response to the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. in Philadelphia and promising to study ways to prevent such shootings if elected president.

Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware after voting on Wednesday, Biden said that “there is no excuse whatsoever for the looting and the violence” that’s broken out in Philadelphia in response to the shooting, but he said protesting overall is “totally legitimate.”

Wallace, 27, a Black man, was fatally shot by police Monday after authorities say he ignored orders to drop a knife. But his family’s lawyer said the family had called for an ambulance to get him help with a mental health crisis. The shooting set off two days of protests, and some demonstrators threw debris at officers, injuring two, according to police.

Biden said he’ll be setting up a commission if elected president to study “how you diminish the prospect of lethal shootings in circumstances like the one we saw.” Biden’s criminal justice plan would increase oversight of police departments and offer funds to support police reforms at the local level.

Biden offered the comments after voting early at a government building in downtown Wilmington. Delaware allows residents to vote early by appointment, and he and wife Jill voted together.

Joe Biden says Omaha supporters of President Donald Trump who were left in the cold after Trump’s rally is “an image that captured President Trump’s whole approach” to the health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

In remarks Wednesday, Biden referred to reports that thousands of people who attended Trump’s campaign rally at a Nebraska airport Tuesday night had to wait around in frigid weather for hours after it ended before they could get back to their cars.

Police later said about six or seven of them were taken to hospitals from the airport grounds “due to a variety of medical conditions.”

Most rallygoers had parked in lots a mile or two from the airport and were shuttled into the 7:30 p.m. event on buses. Shuttle buses were unable to return to the airport as traffic snarled and hundreds of people wandered into the streets around the airport as they tried to walk to their cars.

Police tried to clear traffic and respond to medical emergencies including some people who suffered adverse effects from the cold weather, around 30 degrees.

Trump deputy national press secretary Samantha Zager said Wednesday that because of the size of the crowd 40 shuttle buses were deployed instead of the normal 15. But she says “local road closures and resulting congestion caused delays.”

Zager said the campaign had tents, heaters, generators, hot cocoa, and handwarmers available for guests. She added, “We always strive to provide the best guest experience at our events and we care about their safety.”

Six days out from Election Day, Joe Biden isn’t campaigning in a swing state. Instead, he’s receiving a briefing from public health experts on the coronavirus as cases surge nationwide.

Biden was briefed virtually at a theater in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, Center for Science in the Public Interest director Dr. David Kessler, New York University medical school assistant professor Dr. Celine Grounder and Yale University associate professor of medicine Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith.

The Democrat sat on a stage with briefing materials before him in front of a screen with graphs showing the seven-day rolling average of reported daily COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations over the past four months.

Kessler warned Biden, “We are in the midst of the third wave.”

Data compiled by Johns Hopkins shows more than 226,000 people have died from the virus in the U.S. More than 71,000 people a day are testing positive on average, up from 51,000 two weeks ago. Cases are on the rise in all but two states, Hawaii and Delaware.

New York Times: Tax records show Trump had over $270 million in debt forgiven after failing to repay lenders,530,jjmw7x,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/27/politics/trump-tax-records-chicago-loan/index.html,50,1603917304.0,,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has had more than $270 million in debt forgiven since 2010 after he failed to repay his lenders for a Chicago skyscraper development, The New York Times reported Tuesday.

An analysis of his tax records by the Times shows that after the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago encountered financial problems, big banks and hedge funds cut Trump considerable slack, granting him years of additional time to repay his debts, much of which was ultimately forgiven.

And while the previously unreported forgiven debts would usually fuel a large tax bill, Trump appears to have managed to pay almost no federal income tax on them, the Times reported, partially because of the significant financial losses his other businesses were enduring.

Trump Organization chief legal officer Alan Garten told the Times that the organization and Trump had paid all necessary taxes on the forgiven debts.

""These were all arm's length transactions that were voluntarily entered into between sophisticated parties many years ago in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and the resulting collapse of the real estate markets,"" Garten said.

As of Tuesday, more than 226,000 people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19. The seven-day average of new cases is nearly 70,000, a record number that is only expected to get worse. Hospitalizations and deaths are also climbing steadily upward. According to the COVID Tracking Project, there are more than 42,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19, up from about 30,000 just a month ago.

Meanwhile, Trump has been holding rallies with thousands of people and minimal physical distancing or mask-wearing.

Inequality In The US Is Making It A Powder Keg,3,jj35q5,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/political-violence-inequality-us-election,4,1603841020.0,,"Two researchers claim that a single number they call the “political stress indicator” can warn when societies are at risk of erupting into violence. It’s spiking in the US, just like it did before the Civil War.

Ben Kothe / BuzzFeed News

Many Americans are clinging to the idea that if Joe Biden wins the presidential election, calm can return to a nation riven by protests and rattled by President Donald Trump’s authoritarian rhetoric. Not so fast, caution two academics who claim they have devised a measure of political instability that shows that the nation will still be a powder keg that is waiting to blow, even if a Biden landslide means that Trump has little choice but to step aside. “The tendency is to blame Trump, but I don’t really agree with that,” Peter Turchin, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Connecticut who studies the forces that drive political instability, told BuzzFeed News. “Trump is really not the deep structural cause.” The most dangerous element in the mix, argue Turchin and George Mason University sociologist Jack Goldstone, is the corrosive effect of inequality on society. They believe they have a model that explains how inequality escalates and leads to political instability: Worsened by elites who monopolize economic gains, narrow the path to social mobility, and resist taxation, inequality ends up undermining state institutions while fomenting distrust and resentment. Building on Goldstone’s work showing that revolutions tend to follow periods of population growth and urbanization, Turchin has developed a statistic called the political stress indicator, or PSI. It incorporates measures of wage stagnation, national debt, competition between elites, distrust in government, urbanization, and the age structure of the population. Turchin raised warning signs of a coming storm a decade ago, predicting that instability would peak in the years around 2020. “In the United States, we have stagnating or declining real wages, a growing gap between rich and poor, overproduction of young graduates with advanced degrees, and exploding public debt,” he wrote, in a letter to the journal Nature. “Historically, such developments have served as leading indicators of looming political instability.” Today, with the nation in turmoil, Turchin’s prediction seems remarkably prescient. We live in a pandemic hellscape that has disproportionately harmed Black and brown Americans and those living in poverty. We have widespread civil unrest over racial injustice. And we are hurtling toward an election in which Trump is stoking unfounded fears of voter fraud and refusing to commit to a peaceful transition of power. In August, Turchin gave himself a pat on the back for his predictive ability with an analysis showing a significant rise in political demonstrations and violent riots over the last 10 years. But he and Goldstone fear that much worse is to come.

The political stress indicator for the US is rising rapidly, much like it did before the Civil War.

Peter Aldhous / BuzzFeed News / Via Peter Turchin

When Goldstone talks about America’s darkest days in the 1860s, he provocatively calls it the “First Civil War.” He fears that we may be on the way to a second one, with the 2020 election serving as a potential “fire-starter” event. Goldstone has some credentials in predicting conflict. In 1994, shortly after the US military’s ill-fated efforts to support UN intervention in Somalia’s civil war, which led to the downing of two Black Hawk helicopters and the gruesome spectacle of a dead US soldier being dragged through the streets, Goldstone was tapped by the CIA to help lead the State Failure Task Force. This group of academic social scientists was asked to identify factors that predict when a nation is likely to spiral into chaos. The task force’s initial report, published in 1995, identified three risk factors that seemed to predict whether a state would fail within the next two years in about two-thirds of cases: high infant mortality, low openness to international trade, and level of democracy. On the last measure, partial democracies were more vulnerable to collapse than fully democratic states or autocratic regimes.

Goldstone continued to work on the project, later renamed the Political Instability Task Force, until 2012, tweaking its statistical model to predict both civil wars and democratic collapses with about 80% accuracy over the same two-year lead time. He didn’t think of applying a similar approach to assess the risk of political conflict in the US until Turchin got in touch in 2015. “I didn’t expect political violence because I believed the US was a strong and flexible democracy,” Goldstone said. But he is now convinced that Turchin’s PSI heralds a disturbing future for the US that won’t be solved by politics as usual after the 2020 election, even if Trump is defeated and goes quietly. “If those trends continue after Trump departs, then the risks and the occurrence of violence will likely continue,” Goldstone told BuzzFeed News. “I’m worried about that no matter who wins,” he added. “The social problems are the gasoline. Trump is throwing matches.” The PSI doesn’t explicitly address America’s deep divisions over racial justice. “Race has been an enduring faultline, ever since the founding of the Republic,” Turchin said. But he argued that it’s the additional dynamics captured by the PSI that explain why tensions are boiling over right now. One key concern, according to Goldstone, is that people across the political spectrum have lost faith in government and political institutions. “In short, given the accumulated grievances, anger and distrust fanned for the last two decades, almost any election scenario this fall is likely to lead to popular protests on a scale we have not seen this century,” he and Turchin wrote in a recent article published by the Berggruen Institute, a think tank based in Los Angeles. This would hurtle the US into a period of political instability the researchers dubbed “the turbulent twenties.” “Given the Black Lives Matter protests and cascading clashes between competing armed factions in cities across the United States, from Portland, Oregon, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, we are already well on our way there,” the article said. “But worse likely lies ahead.”



“The social problems are the gasoline. Trump is throwing matches.”



Turchin said people who rule out the possibility of serious political violence in the US based on “the strength of American institutions” are being “unduly optimistic.” “The social system that we live in is extremely fragile,” Turchin said. Other social scientists consulted by BuzzFeed News were skeptical that the US is on the brink of a civil war. But they were concerned about the trends highlighted by Goldstone and Turchin, and worried about the potential for violence around the coming election — especially from right-wing militia groups if Trump loses and contests the result. “No matter what the outcome is, it is going to be disputed by some components of the other side,” Craig Jenkins, a sociologist at Ohio State University who studies political violence, told BuzzFeed News. “The difference is that the Trump forces have militia that have some capacity for violence and mayhem.” One reason that most experts in conflict studies don’t predict an outright civil war as a consequence of the US’s gap between rich and poor is that inequality hasn’t emerged as a major driving factor in studies of such conflicts in the modern era. “Civil war has been predominantly a phenomenon in low-income countries,” James Fearon, a political scientist at Stanford University and coauthor of a 2003 paper that identified national poverty as an important condition that can lead to violent insurgency, told BuzzFeed News. Another influential study, published in 2000 by the economists Paul Collier of the University of Oxford and Anke Hoeffler, now at the University of Konstanz in Germany, suggested that an armed group’s ability to seize control over significant economic resources — such as diamonds in several conflict-prone African nations and drug crops in Colombia — was a key driver of modern civil wars. As a rich nation with a diverse and robust economy, the US should have a fairly low chance of falling into civil war according to these theories. And if push comes to shove and order needs to be restored by force, few experts in political conflict expect even a well-armed militia to be a match for federal law enforcement or the National Guard. The circumstances in the 19th century that led the US into the bloodiest conflict in its history were also unusual. The young nation was growing, adding states that either opposed or supported slavery, creating a fundamental economic and moral divide that couldn’t easily be resolved. “That was an irreconcilable dynamic,” Jenkins said. “I think you need the accumulation of irresolvable conflicts to get a true civil war.” But recent events, notably the plot by a group of right-wing militants to kidnap and potentially kill the Democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, over her policies to limit the spread of the coronavirus, have shocked even skeptics of the idea that the US is teetering on the brink of civil conflict. “This is really concerning,” Fearon said. The PSI isn’t the only indicator that has set alarm bells ringing about the stability of the US. The Fund for Peace, a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, has developed a measure called the Fragile States Index (FSI) that, like the work of the State Failure Task Force, seeks to identify nations that are at risk of violence and instability from a range of underlying pressures including economic distress, refugee flows, and their record on human rights. Overall, the US looks reasonably healthy on the FSI, ranked 149th out of 178 countries for its potential for instability. But there are worrying signs for the US on a component of the FSI labeled “cohesion,” according to Fund for Peace programs manager Natalie Fiertz. “Over the past decade-plus, we’ve seen very rapid worsening of the score for those dimensions,” she told BuzzFeed News. The Fragile States Index shows that the US is becoming a less cohesive society.

Peter Aldhous / BuzzFeed News / Via fragilestatesindex.org

This chart shows change in the average score across the three cohesion components of the FSI for the members of the G7 group of rich democracies. These measure security threats including terrorism and organized crime, factionalization of a nation’s elites, and schisms between different groups in society. Not surprisingly, given the intense and growing political polarization in the US, it is the last two measures that explain why the nation’s cohesion score has gone from the second best among the G7 to the worst in just 15 years. (In recent years, the UK has closely followed the US on this measure, driven by its own political divisions over Brexit.) But political polarization may be just another consequence of the economic inequality that Goldstone and Turchin argue lies at the heart of the US’s current vulnerability to political violence. Political scientists have put a great deal of energy into identifying why polarization in the US is escalating. But factors including the influence of partisan cable TV news and congressional redistricting don’t seem to provide the answer — the latter, for instance, can’t explain why the Senate has become increasingly divided. What is clear is that polarization in Congress has historically tracked closely with income inequality. And recent studies have shown that states with greater income inequality tend to have more polarized state legislatures — supporting the idea that inequality is a fundamental cause of America’s deep political divisions.

NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s request that the United States replace him as the defendant in a defamation lawsuit, which alleges he raped a woman in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s, was denied Tuesday by a federal judge.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan came after the Justice Department argued that the United States — and by extension the American people — should replace Trump as the defendant in a lawsuit filed by the columnist E. Jean Carroll.

The government’s lawyers contended that the United States could step in as the defendant because Trump was forced to respond to her lawsuit to prove he was physically and mentally fit for the job.

A lawyer for Carroll, Roberta Kaplan, called it a clear victory for her client.

“The simple truth is that President Trump defamed our client because she was brave enough to reveal that he had sexually assaulted her, and that brutal, personal attack cannot be attributed to the Office of the President,” Kaplan said in a statement.

Messages were left on Tuesday for lawyers for Trump and the Justice Department seeking comment.

The judge ruled that a law protecting federal employees from being sued individually for things they do within the scope of their employment didn’t apply to a president.

“The President of the United States is not an employee of the Government within the meaning of the relevant statutes,” Kaplan wrote. “Even if he were such an employee, President Trumps allegedly defamatory statements concerning Ms. Carroll would not have been within the scope of his employment.”

Lawyers for Carroll had written that “only in a world gone mad could it somehow be presidential, not personal, for Trump to slander a woman who he sexually assaulted.”

The Justice Department relied solely on written arguments in the dispute after its lawyer was banned from a Manhattan federal courthouse last week because he had not quarantined for two weeks after traveling to New York from a state on a list of those whose coronavirus test rates were high.

Carroll, a former longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, said in her lawsuit that in the fall of 1995 or spring of 1996 she and Trump met in a chance encounter when they recognized each other at the Bergdorf Goodman store.

She said they engaged in a lighthearted chat about trying on a see-through lilac gray bodysuit when they made their way to a dressing room, where she said Trump pushed her against a wall and raped her.

The Associated Press does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done.

Trump said Carroll was “totally lying” to sell a memoir and that he’d never met her, though a 1987 photo showed them and their then-spouses at a social event. He said the photo captured a moment when he was standing in a line.

In a statement responding to the ruling on Tuesday, Carroll said: “When I spoke out about what Donald Trump did to me in a department store dressing room, I was speaking out against an individual. When Donald Trump called me a liar and denied that he had ever met me, he was not speaking on behalf of the United States.”

Carroll, who wants unspecified damages and a retraction of Trump’s statements, also seeks a DNA sample from Trump to see whether it matches as-yet-unidentified male genetic material found on a dress that she says she was wearing during the alleged attack."
"Mitch McConnell just adjourned the Senate until November 9, ending the prospect of additional coronavirus relief until after the election",657,jj0fv5,https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-adjourns-until-after-election-without-covid-19-bill-2020-10,94,1603831597.0,,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has adjourned the Senate until November 9.

The move ends the prospect of an additional coronavirus stimulus deal being reached before Election Day.

Democrats and Republicans have been at odds over the terms of a deal, with Senate Democrats last week blocking a ""skinny"" $500 billion bill re-proposed by Republicans.

The two parties also battled over the process leading up to Judge Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to the Supreme Court, which was the Senate's last major order of business on Monday before adjourning.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday motioned for the Senate to adjourn until November 9.

The move shuts down the Senate from doing any legislative business, including reaching a deal on additional coronavirus aid, until after voters have cast their ballots, and it comes on the heels of Monday's 52-48 vote to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court.

David Popp, a representative for McConnell, told Business Insider there was ""nothing to add"" to what he described as McConnell's ""extensive remarks on the continued Democrat filibuster on COVID relief in the Senate.""

Alex Nguyen, a representative for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, referred Business Insider to a Saturday statement accusing Republicans of sidelining coronavirus talks while pushing forward with Barrett's confirmation process ahead of the election.

""Today, we're going to give the Republican majority in the Senate the opportunity to consider critical legislation that has so far languished in Leader McConnell's legislative graveyard,"" Schumer said in the statement, adding: ""We should be doing that, not rushing through this nomination while people are voting, and want their choice listened to, not the Republican Senate choice.""

Republicans and Democrats have increasingly sparred as the election approaches, particularly over additional federal coronavirus relief and Barrett's nomination.

On Friday, Democrats used a variety of procedural tactics in a last-ditch effort to stall Barrett's confirmation, and the two parties have extensively rehashed talking points and arguments that have built up from decades of Supreme Court battles.

""You will never, never get your credibility back,"" Schumer told Republicans in a speech on the Senate floor on Monday, warning the GOP that it had no right to tell Democrats how to run Congress next time Democrats were in power.

On coronavirus aid, the two parties have been unable to find enough common ground to reach a deal, with Republicans nixing proposals they describe as too expensive. McConnell effectively torpedoed a stimulus bill of $1.8 trillion to $2.2 trillion earlier this month that Democrats had been negotiating with the White House.

Republicans had instead insisted that a ""skinny"" bill of $500 billion would be enough, but their proposal omitted aid to states as well as $1,200 direct payments to taxpayers, both key Democratic priorities, and the Democrats ultimately tanked the measure last week."
Missing From Supreme Court’s Election Cases: Reasons for Its Rulings,85,jiqt8s,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/supreme-court-election-cases.html,4,1603786795.0,,"More recently, emergency applications in voting cases have spiked. Lower courts have struggled to make sense of the court’s orders, which are something less than precedents but nonetheless cannot be ignored by responsible judges.

Is it possible to trace some themes in the court’s election orders? Sure.

One is that Republicans tend to win. Another, as Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion this month, speaking only for himself, is that “federal courts ordinarily should not alter state election rules in the period close to an election.”

He cited the 2006 ruling that has come to stand for that proposition, Purcell v. Gonzalez. Or perhaps “ruling” is too generous a word, as Purcell itself was an unsigned, cryptic, tentative and equivocal product of the court’s shadow docket. It has given rise to a “shadow doctrine,” Professor Stephanopoulos wrote last month in an essay on Take Care, a legal blog.

The Purcell case concerned an Arizona voter ID law. A trial judge refused to block it, but, about a month before the 2006 general election, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an injunction forbidding state officials to enforce it.

The Supreme Court, ironically in light of where its own practices were heading, criticized the Ninth Circuit for offering “no explanation or justification for its order,” and it let the election proceed with the voter ID law in force.

The passage in the Purcell ruling that has been boiled down to the shadow doctrine of a near-categorical bar on late-breaking adjustments to state election procedures by federal courts was three sentences long. It was not at all clear, but it suggested that judges should balance competing interests and use judgment.

“Faced with an application to enjoin operation of voter identification procedures just weeks before an election, the Court of Appeals was required to weigh, in addition to the harms attendant upon issuance or non-issuance of an injunction, considerations specific to election cases and its own institutional procedures,” the unsigned opinion said. “Court orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.”"
[META] r/NeutralNews: new policies and requests for feedback,49,jio692,https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/jio692/meta_rneutralnews_new_policies_and_requests_for/,88,1603777848.0,"Dear users,

Synthesizing mod discussions and incorporating feedback from the [previous META post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/id6naf/meta_rneutralnews_update_on_recent_changes_and/) here are some recent rule changes and other issues we're discussing to improve r/NeutralNews:


**Sources must support the claim**

We're cracking down on the use of sources that do not support the claim made in the comment.

[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) has been modified to include the requirement that factual claims require a qualified **and supporting** link.

Along these lines, if you make a claim and then discover it's difficult to find a qualified source to support it, please consider that *your claim may be wrong or speculative.* We ask users participate with open minds, which means reconsidering our positions based on the evidence that's available, *or unavailable.*

**Quote the relevant section**

/u/kougabro suggests enforcing the above rule this way:

> Here is a simple solution: provide a quote from the source that backs up your point. If you are going to cite an article that supports your claim, it shouldn't be too hard to find a relevant quote in the article.

> That way, the burden of proof is on the commenter, rather than on the people reading the comment having to dig up and guess what might support the comment in the source.

The mods like this idea, so we're now requiring that commenters quote the relevant line from the source to support their claims.

**In-line citations**

We're adding some formatting requirements to discourage comments that make a series of factual claims and then just paste a bunch of sources at the end, leaving the readers to figure out which article supports which claim and where. The new rule reads:

> All statements of fact must be clearly associated with a supporting source. Users can [hyperlink a source for the claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines) (preferred), provide a footnote (^1 or [1]), or enclose the link in parentheses. If you're referencing the submitted article or a source that's already been posted in the same comment chain, please indicate that and block quote the relevant section.

**Addressing whataboutism**

Based on feedback from the users and discussions within the mod team, we had intended to take a stand against [whataboutism,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) ""a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy"" that's used as a ""diversionary tactic to distract the opponent from their original criticism."" 

Our view is that whataboutism is usually off topic under Rule 3. However, determining whether a phrase is invoking whataboutism requires making a judgment call about *relevance*, and it turns out that's not so simple. 

In trying to come up with examples, the mods couldn't even find any that we all agreed were or weren't whataboutism. If we can't consistently recognize it in our own internal discussions, the chances we'd be able to adjudicate it consistently in the users' comments is very low, so we postponed the idea for the time being to solicit more feedback.

Can you come up with clear examples of claims that are and aren't whataboutism? Is there a universally accepted definition that doesn't rely on the ""I'll know it when I see it"" principle?

**Broadening what constitutes a bannable offense**

We're in the process of revamping our ban procedures, but in the meantime, we've decided to more strictly enforce the part of our guidelines that says ""deliberate and unrepentant violations of any rule"" can result in a ban. 

Specifically, this means we're watching repeated violations of Rules 2 & 3 more carefully, though we will issue warnings before banning anyone. Complete details will be provided when we roll out our new ban policy.

**Editorialized headlines**

Our current guidelines say we will remove submissions that utilize a ""misleading, biased or inflammatory title."" 

The original intention of this rule was to avoid titles that don't match the contents of the article, so even if the title is biased or inflammatory, we don't remove it if that language matches what's in the article. But it's unclear from the current wording that this is the rule's purpose, so users think we should be eliminating every article with a title that fits the description, regardless of the article's content.

Moving forward, we obviously need to rewrite this part of the guidelines. However, we've been reluctant to switch to the second interpretation, because it would introduce a lot of subjectivity, which leads to inconsistent moderation and accusations of bias (i.e. ""How come you removed my submission when that other headline is just as bad?""). It's not too difficult to define *misleading*, but *biased* and *inflammatory* are pretty subjective.

Are editorialized headlines enough of a problem that we should switch to the second, broader interpretation of the rule, despite that fact that it could introduce more subjectivity to the moderation?

**Source restrictions and Fox News**

The rules link to lists on Wikipedia that form the basis for our blacklist and whitelist of submission sources, but also say:

> ...where the sources for those lists don't draw a clear conclusion, [they] will be reviewed against the ratings on [Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC).](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/filtered-search/) A rating of ""Mostly Factual"" or higher gets a domain onto the whitelist and below that goes on the blacklist.

There have only been a few cases where the Wikipedia list doesn't draw a clear conclusion. One of those is Fox News, for which it says:

> There is consensus that Fox News is generally reliable for news coverage on topics *other than politics and science.* (emphasis added)

and:

> There is no consensus on the reliability of Fox News's coverage of politics and science.

Since a good portion of what gets posted in r/NeutralNews is politics and science, per the rules, we checked Fox News on MBFC, which rates it as ""Mixed"" for factual reporting. That's below our threshold, so we added it to the blacklist.

If you have additional suggestions or feedback on how to handle situations like this where the Wikipedia list is inconclusive, please let us know.

**Sites that appear on none of our third-party source lists**

We maintain a blacklist and whitelist for submission sources. The criteria for adding to those lists is [published in our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralNews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) and relies on third-party ratings. However, we've been operating without a policy for what to do when a site appears on none of those third-party sites.

This happens most frequently when it's a local or foreign news site. We've been reluctant to blacklist those, because they're often the best sources for local stories, but we don't have a standard for when to whitelist them and when not to. 

What do you think the criteria should be?

**Paywalls**

The consensus among the mods and the users is that we should allow articles behind paywalls. The rules have been changed to that effect. 

**Abuse of the reporting system**

Because we have a small mod team that cannot be everywhere at once, we encourage the users to report content that violates our rules. However, report abuse has become a problem here. 

Every time you report something that doesn't actually violate the rules, you're making unnecessary work for the mods. Disliking someone's opinion or the way they express it is not a reason to report their comment. Instead, we ask you to *politely* reply to them, ignore them, or block them.

We've been getting a lot of bogus reports, but since the mods still have to chase down and investigate each claim, this makes extra work for us. Please stop. This is never going to be a sanitized forum with content everyone approves of. We notify the admins when we see abuse of the reporting system.

**Merit system**

r/NeutralNews has a feature where you can [give awards to high quality comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/wiki/guidelines#wiki_awards) by replying with '!merit' (no quotes).

Are you using it? Is it working as intended? How could it be improved?

We're also aware the system has had some technical problems, so if you've experienced issues with awarding merit, please let us know.

— r/NeutralNews mods","Dear users,

Synthesizing mod discussions and incorporating feedback from the previous META post, here are some recent rule changes and other issues we're discussing to improve r/NeutralNews:

Sources must support the claim

We're cracking down on the use of sources that do not support the claim made in the comment.

Rule 2 has been modified to include the requirement that factual claims require a qualified and supporting link.

Along these lines, if you make a claim and then discover it's difficult to find a qualified source to support it, please consider that your claim may be wrong or speculative. We ask users participate with open minds, which means reconsidering our positions based on the evidence that's available, or unavailable.

Quote the relevant section

/u/kougabro suggests enforcing the above rule this way:

Here is a simple solution: provide a quote from the source that backs up your point. If you are going to cite an article that supports your claim, it shouldn't be too hard to find a relevant quote in the article.

That way, the burden of proof is on the commenter, rather than on the people reading the comment having to dig up and guess what might support the comment in the source.

The mods like this idea, so we're now requiring that commenters quote the relevant line from the source to support their claims.

In-line citations

We're adding some formatting requirements to discourage comments that make a series of factual claims and then just paste a bunch of sources at the end, leaving the readers to figure out which article supports which claim and where. The new rule reads:

All statements of fact must be clearly associated with a supporting source. Users can hyperlink a source for the claim (preferred), provide a footnote (1 or [1]), or enclose the link in parentheses. If you're referencing the submitted article or a source that's already been posted in the same comment chain, please indicate that and block quote the relevant section.

Addressing whataboutism

Based on feedback from the users and discussions within the mod team, we had intended to take a stand against whataboutism, ""a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy"" that's used as a ""diversionary tactic to distract the opponent from their original criticism.""

Our view is that whataboutism is usually off topic under Rule 3. However, determining whether a phrase is invoking whataboutism requires making a judgment call about relevance, and it turns out that's not so simple.

In trying to come up with examples, the mods couldn't even find any that we all agreed were or weren't whataboutism. If we can't consistently recognize it in our own internal discussions, the chances we'd be able to adjudicate it consistently in the users' comments is very low, so we postponed the idea for the time being to solicit more feedback.

Can you come up with clear examples of claims that are and aren't whataboutism? Is there a universally accepted definition that doesn't rely on the ""I'll know it when I see it"" principle?

Broadening what constitutes a bannable offense

We're in the process of revamping our ban procedures, but in the meantime, we've decided to more strictly enforce the part of our guidelines that says ""deliberate and unrepentant violations of any rule"" can result in a ban.

Specifically, this means we're watching repeated violations of Rules 2 & 3 more carefully, though we will issue warnings before banning anyone. Complete details will be provided when we roll out our new ban policy.

Editorialized headlines

Our current guidelines say we will remove submissions that utilize a ""misleading, biased or inflammatory title.""

The original intention of this rule was to avoid titles that don't match the contents of the article, so even if the title is biased or inflammatory, we don't remove it if that language matches what's in the article. But it's unclear from the current wording that this is the rule's purpose, so users think we should be eliminating every article with a title that fits the description, regardless of the article's content.

Moving forward, we obviously need to rewrite this part of the guidelines. However, we've been reluctant to switch to the second interpretation, because it would introduce a lot of subjectivity, which leads to inconsistent moderation and accusations of bias (i.e. ""How come you removed my submission when that other headline is just as bad?""). It's not too difficult to define misleading, but biased and inflammatory are pretty subjective.

Are editorialized headlines enough of a problem that we should switch to the second, broader interpretation of the rule, despite that fact that it could introduce more subjectivity to the moderation?

Source restrictions and Fox News

The rules link to lists on Wikipedia that form the basis for our blacklist and whitelist of submission sources, but also say:

...where the sources for those lists don't draw a clear conclusion, [they] will be reviewed against the ratings on Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC). A rating of ""Mostly Factual"" or higher gets a domain onto the whitelist and below that goes on the blacklist.

There have only been a few cases where the Wikipedia list doesn't draw a clear conclusion. One of those is Fox News, for which it says:

There is consensus that Fox News is generally reliable for news coverage on topics other than politics and science. (emphasis added)

and:

There is no consensus on the reliability of Fox News's coverage of politics and science.

Since a good portion of what gets posted in r/NeutralNews is politics and science, per the rules, we checked Fox News on MBFC, which rates it as ""Mixed"" for factual reporting. That's below our threshold, so we added it to the blacklist.

If you have additional suggestions or feedback on how to handle situations like this where the Wikipedia list is inconclusive, please let us know.

Sites that appear on none of our third-party source lists

We maintain a blacklist and whitelist for submission sources. The criteria for adding to those lists is published in our guidelines and relies on third-party ratings. However, we've been operating without a policy for what to do when a site appears on none of those third-party sites.

This happens most frequently when it's a local or foreign news site. We've been reluctant to blacklist those, because they're often the best sources for local stories, but we don't have a standard for when to whitelist them and when not to.

What do you think the criteria should be?

Paywalls

The consensus among the mods and the users is that we should allow articles behind paywalls. The rules have been changed to that effect.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Ahmir Thompson, founder of The Roots and drummer for the “Tonight Show” band, wants to find the kind stranger who bought him a turntable and several records at the tender age of 5.

Thompson — better known as Questlove — posted on social media that he was traveling with his parents, who made their living playing gigs, when he made friends with “Ellie” in 1976 in Portland, Maine.

“Being the irresistible cat that I was, I talked an older woman named Ellie into buying me a stereo and a record collection,” Questlove posted on Facebook and Instagram.

Ellie wrote the youngster’s order on a napkin: “Bad Blood” by Neil Sedaka, “Dance With Me” by Rufus, and the Jackson 5.

“I knew talking to strangers was a no-no, but my instincts paid off,” he wrote.

His parents were upset that he’d been chatting up a stranger when Ellie returned the next day bearing gifts. But he says his new friend told his parents “please don’t have him get in trouble on my behalf!! He’s so cute of course I wanted to start his record collection!!!”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Nancy Pelosi once predicted she’d have the 2020 House Democratic majority secured by November — of 2019.

Now, days before the Nov. 3 election , she seems to have done it, and she’s expanding her reach.

With control of the House hardly contested, Pelosi is working to fortify Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and win extra House seats in case Congress is called on to resolve any Electoral College dispute with President Donald Trump.

Pelosi said she feels so confident Democrats will keep the House this election, she’s already preparing to win the next one in 2022.

“This year, I’m trying to win it two years in advance — by being so substantial in this election that as soon as we start into the next year, people will see our strength,” Pelosi told The Associated Press in an interview.

“We intend to hold the House and grow our numbers,” she said about the election Nov. 3, and “contribute to winning the Senate and the presidency.”

It’s a stunning turnaround for the speaker, who just two years ago was being challenged for her job leading House Democrats. Pelosi rose as the face of party, the House impeached the president and emboldened Democrats are on the march to pick up House seats deep into Trump country.

Democrats are working to reelect some 40 House freshmen elected in the 2018 midterm to win the majority, most of them from districts Trump won in 2016. They’re digging deeper for additional seats in historically out-of-reach Republican strongholds including Nebraska, Indiana and even Alaska and Montana, where winners could tip the balance in an Electoral College dispute.

To wrest control, Republicans need to gain some 20 seats, but even the House GOP leadership has downplayed their chances. Strategists say Trump is a drag at the top of the GOP ticket. Even though Republicans recruited more female and minority candidates to compete with Democrats in suburban swing districts, the battle for the House is something of an afterthought in the marquee contests for control of the White House and the Senate.

“A rising tide lifts all boats, and right now it seems a Democratic tide is rising,” said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist and former top aide to House GOP leadership.

ADVERTISEMENT

Steel said it has less to to with Pelosi’s planning than the national political environment. “I attribute the presumed success of her efforts to keep the majority more to Trump’s failures than to her stated leadership,” he said.

Those close to Pelosi’s political operation did not always join her prediction that Democrats would handily keep control.

Trump wasn’t on the ballot when they picked up the majority two years ago, and freshmen are often the most vulnerable to defeat as they seek reelection, especially this class of lawmakers now having to run alongside the president in districts often off-limits to Democrats.

Pelosi pushed ahead with the risky House vote to impeach the president in late 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine only to see the Senate, controlled by Republicans, vote to acquit him of the charges in a highly charged political environment early this year.

When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Capitol abruptly shuttered. Pelosi engineered a rules change to allow the House to vote by proxy and work online, but it left lawmakers largely away from Washington. Now Pelosi is holding out for a robust COVID-19 aid package with the Trump administration, another risky move, seeking a $2 trillion-plus deal Republicans don’t want to give .

Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill, who is the chairwoman of the party’s campaign arm in the House, said she counseled the new lawmakers not to get swept up in the national political debate but “run your race like you’re running for mayor” — meeting with constituents and responding to issues close to home.

“When we set out to do this work in 2019 we had no idea what this cycle would hold,” said Lucina Guinn, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s executive director.

The goal, she said, was to make the incumbents “as strong as possible” while also recruiting new candidates “to set up a big battlefield.”

Money helps. Pelosi is on track to be a $1 billion fundraiser for her party — an eye-popping sum during nearly two decades in leadership.

This election cycle she raised $227.9 million for Democrats — most of it for the House campaign arm — but she also shoveled $4 million for Biden from an August event and sent nearly $5 million to the state parties.

“We are ready,” Pelosi said.

She said she believes Democrats would sweep if the election were today, but it’s still a week out. “It doesn’t keep me up from the standpoint of worrying about it,” she said, “but it does get me up early to do something about it.”

It’s another surprising turn that the Affordable Care Act, which helped cost Pelosi her House majority in the 2010 election after Democrats passed “Obamacare,” is now a political calling card being used to win over Trump voters during the COVID-19 crisis.

Voters have come to rely on the health care law’s guarantees that those with preexisting health conditions can access insurance and parents can keep their adult children on family policies. A decade after President Barack Obama signed the ACA into law, Republicans are still trying to undo it , including in a court case heading to the Supreme Court a week after the election.

“Progressive ideas are actually popular, not just with progressives but also with moderate voters, with independent voters and maybe even with some Republican voters,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a co-chair of the progressive caucus.

As Pelosi, of California, becomes an even more public presence for the party, Republicans run countless campaign ads against her. But she also has a following from those celebrating her high-profile standoffs with Trump. Since the spring COVID-19 crisis, she has appeared 20 times on the Sunday morning news shows and done more than 150 national television and radio interviews, her office said.

“I would not miss any opportunity, on behalf of my colleagues, to make sure that there’s clarity on where we’re coming from on some of these issues,” she said.

She plans to run again for speaker, if Democrats keep control of the House: “Definitely.”

But that’s for later. Pelosi notes experts have suggested Democrats will pick up between five and 15 House seats.

“Our goal originally was to hold the House,” she said. “Everything we get after that will just be a further enhancement.”

"Far-Right Groups Are Behind Most U.S. Terrorist Attacks, Report Finds",348,jifm30,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/24/us/domestic-terrorist-groups.html,35,1603751607.0,,"It said that if the Democratic presidential candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., wins the election, white supremacists could mobilize, with targets likely to be Black people, Latinos, Jews and Muslims. A Republican presidential victory could involve violence emanating out of large-scale demonstrations, the report said.

There were some encouraging signs. The number of fatalities from domestic terrorism has been relatively low so far this year, compared with some periods of U.S. history.

Five fatalities were caused by domestic terrorism in the first eight months of this year, compared with the past five years, in which total fatalities ranged from 22 people to 66.

The study attributed the lower number of fatalities to effective intervention by the F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies.

The relatively low number of fatalities that resulted from a high number of terrorist incidents showed that extremists this year have wanted to send messages through threats and intimidation, the report found. Many of the incidents involved vehicles or weapons, so there was a high potential for fatalities, but “an apparent lack of will,” it said.

Of the five fatal attacks this year, the report attributed one in Portland, Ore., to an activist affiliated with the loose far-left movement known as “antifa”; one in Austin, Texas, to a man described as a “far-right extremist”; one in New Jersey to an “anti-feminist”; and two in California to a man linked to the so-called Boogaloo movement, an anti-government group whose members seek to exploit public unrest to incite a race war.

In an endnote, the researchers said they did not classify the shooting in Kenosha, Wis., that killed two protesters in August, as a terrorist attack. They said that the person charged in the shooting, a teenager whose social media accounts showed strong support for the police, “lacked a clear political motive for the killings.”"

Lesley Stahl: (LAUGH) You're not okay with tough questions?

President Donald Trump: I want them to be fair. You-- you don't ask Biden tough questions.

President Donald Trump: Okay. Are you ready--

Lesley Stahl: You ready? Everybody ready? So we have the pandemic. On your watch, we've had racial strife, we've had looting. Why do you want this job? Why do you wanna be president again?

President Donald Trump: Because we've done a great job and it's not finished yet. And when I finish, this country will be in a position like it hasn't been maybe ever. The economy is already roaring back. And-- other people aren't gonna bring it back, certainly the person that we're dealing with is not gonna bring it back. They're gonna raise taxes.

President Donald Trump

Lesley Stahl: Let me ask you what you think your-- the biggest domestic priority is for you right now.

President Donald Trump: Well--

Lesley Stahl: Or next year.

President Donald Trump: Ultimately, le-- let me-- and I-- I'll tell ya, it was happening. We created the greatest economy in the history of our country. And the other side was--

Lesley Stahl: You know that-- you know--

President Donald Trump: --coming in-

Lesley Stahl: --that's not true.

President Donald Trump: It is totally true.

Lesley Stahl: No.

It isn't, but President Trump did have an impressive string of economic accomplishments.

President Donald Trump: We had the best stock market price ever and we're getting close to that price again. The unemployment numbers for African Americans, for Asian Americans, for Hispanic Americans. Virtually every number was the best. And what was happening is things were coming together—

Lesley Stahl: I asked you what's the priority? I mean, those are all the good things--

President Donald Trump: The priority now--

Lesley Stahl: --what do you have to solve?

President Donald Trump: --is to get back to normal. Get back to where we were. To have the economy rage and be great with jobs and everybody be happy. And that's where we're going, and that's--

Lesley Stahl: And--

President Donald Trump: --where we're heading.

Lesley Stahl: And who is our biggest foreign adversary?

President Donald Trump: I would say China. They're an adversary. They're a--

Lesley Stahl: They're the biggest?

President Donald Trump: --competitor. They're a foe in many ways, but they're an adversary. I think what happened was disgraceful, should never have happened. Should-- they should never have allowed this plague to get out of China and go throughout the world. 188 countries. Should never have happened.

Lesley Stahl: Four years ago, you were behind in the polls, as you are now, and you pulled it out. But this time, you have kind of a double migraine. You have unemployment claims going up. You have COVID cases going up. I mean, it's like the gods have suddenly decided-- decided to conspire against you--

President Donald Trump: I don't think so at all, no. I think we've done--

Lesley Stahl: Well, what about the--

President Donald Trump: --a great job with COVID.

Lesley Stahl: Sir, excuse me, cases are up in about 40 states.

President Donald Trump: Okay-- you know why cases are up also? Because we do more testing. The fake news media loves to say cases are up. The fact is, we've done a very, very good job--

Lesley Stahl: Cases are up.

President Donald Trump: We have done-- that's right because we're doing so much testing.

There is increased testing, but according to the COVID Tracking Project, that doesn't account for all of the rise in new cases sweeping the country, or the 40% increase in hospitalizations in the past month.

Lesley Stahl: When you're out there saying we've turned the corner, this thing is disappearing--

President Donald Trump: That's right. We have turned--

Lesley Stahl: --and people can see--

President Donald Trump: --the corner. We have turned the corner.

Lesley Stahl: --people can see cases going up all over the-- in the Midwest, in the Mountain West, record numbers of cases--

President Donald Trump: We have turned the corner.

Lesley Stahl: --in some states.

President Donald Trump: We understand the disease. We understand the elderly, and we are taking care of them like nobody's ever taken care of 'em. So we are taking care of our people.

Lesley Stahl: Okay. Let me-- let me ask you something about suburban women.

President Donald Trump: Yeah.

President Trump at a rally:

Suburban women will you please like me? Please, please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay?

Lesley Stahl: You said the other day to suburban women, ""Will you please like me? Please, please--""

President Donald Trump: Oh, I didn't say that. You know, that's so misleading, the way y-- I say jokingly, ""Suburban women, you should love me because I'm giving you security."" And I got rid of the worst regulation-- see, the way you said that--

Lesley Stahl: Yeah?

President Donald Trump: --is why people think of you and everyone else as fake news. I said kiddingly, ""Suburban women, you should love me."" I got rid of a regulation--

Lesley Stahl: You said, quote--

President Donald Trump: --that would bring low-income housing into suburbia that is destroying-- that would destroy suburbia. And I said that in a joking way. The way you have it, it's like, ""Oh,"" like I'm begging. I w-- I'm kidding. Play it, and I'm kidding. That is such a misleading question, Lesley.

Lesley Stahl: But you're behind with suburban women in the polls.

President Donald Trump: I doubt it. I doubt it. I really doubt it.

Lesley Stahl: One of the reasons is that they don't feel you're being upfront about the pandemic. Are you deliberately downplaying it?

President Donald Trump: –we're rounding the corner. We're doing well. We're doing well. We understand the disease. We've done a good job. We've done maybe a great job. What we haven't done a good job on is convincing people like you because you're really quite impossible to convince, but that's okay. And the economy now is coming back and it's coming back very strongly, and people see that, Lesley.

Lesley Stahl: There are more unemployment claims-- I mean, the economy has kind of--

President Donald Trump: Lesley, we just picked up--

Lesley Stahl: --stalled a little bit.

President Donald Trump: --11.4 million jobs. It's the largest number in the history of our country--

It is true that of the 22 million jobs lost since February, 11.4 million have been restored. Yet, unemployment claims are running at historically high levels. But the president sees the economy as his strongest suit.

President Donald Trump: Gallup did a poll, 56% of the people said that they're better off now, during a pandemic, than they were during Obama and Biden. 56%. It was a record number.



Lesley Stahl: Can we go back for one second to the pandemic, because-- you called Dr. Fauci and other health officials idiots.

President Donald Trump: Where did I call him an idiot?

Lesley Stahl: You called them ""idiots."" I wonder if you think--

President Donald Trump: Well, he's been wrong a lot. I like him, but he's been wrong a lot.

Lesley Stahl: --I-- I wonder if you think that masks don't work.

President Donald Trump: I feel masks possibly work. But certainly you want to stay away a certain distance, socially distance, et cetera. But I would say a mask works. And I have nothing against masks. And I tell people to wear masks. I have no problem--

Lesley Stahl: Well, tell me then about these rallies you've been having--

President Donald Trump: A lotta people are wearing masks, and they're outside.

Lesley Stahl: --with people-- a lot of people-- aren't. I'm-- I'm watching all these people jammed in together, and I'm seeing most of them without masks. And I'm wondering the message that you're sending with these pictures coming across television--

President Donald Trump: Take a look. Yesterday we were in Arizona, record-setting rallies. Numbers of people like nobody's seen before.

Lesley Stahl: You used to have bigger rallies.

President Donald Trump: No, these are much bigger than I ever had--

Lesley Stahl: Okay, I don't wanna bicker over that.

President Donald Trump: You know, you're-- you're--

Lesley Stahl: Tell me about the mask wearing.

President Donald Trump: --so negative. You're so negative. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had. You just come in here with that negative attitude. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had.

Lesley Stahl: But I can't believe, after what happened in the Rose Garden here, after the announcement, with all the people getting sick--

President Donald Trump: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: --that you are not being more strongly encouraging about wearing masks--

President Donald Trump: I am.

Lesley Stahl: --at your rallies-

President Donald Trump: I tell people to wear masks--

Lesley Stahl: But you don't.

President Donald Trump: Lesley, we hand out thousands of masks at every rally.

Lesley Stahl: But you look out and they're not wearing them. You don't get up there and say, ""Look. You know, come on. I don't want you to--""

President Donald Trump: What's your-- what's your next--

Lesley Stahl: --""get sick.""

President Donald Trump: --question, Lesley? We're outside. The rallies are bigger than they've ever been. There's more enthusiasm than we've ever had. There has never been anything like what you're witnessing now, and you'll see that soon.

Lesley Stahl: Okay, I'll ask you another health question, okay? Told you. Okay. You promised that there was gonna be a new health package, a health care plan.

President Donald Trump: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: You said that it was, ""Gonna be great,"" you said ""It's ready,"" ""It's gonna be ready--""

President Donald Trump: It will be.

Lesley Stahl: ""It'll be here in two weeks."" ""It's gonna be like nothing you've ever seen before."" And of course we haven't seen it. So why didn't you develop a health plan?

President Donald Trump: It is developed, it is fully developed. It's going to be announced very soon--

Lesley Stahl: When?

President Donald Trump: When we see what happens with Obamacare.

Lesley Stahl: If the Supreme Court ends this-- Obamacare--

President Donald Trump: Well, we're gonna have to see what happens. I think-- I hope that they end it. It'll be so good if they end it--

Lesley Stahl: And if they end it people with preexisting conditions will be stranded. And that's just a fact.

President Donald Trump: No, no. It's wrong.

Lesley Stahl: No--

President Donald Trump: It's wrong. A new plan will happen.

Lesley Stahl: But will--

President Donald Trump: And we won't do anything-- will and is. We won't do anything and no plan unless we have preexisting conditions covered.

With little more than a week till the election, the president has been barnstorming the swing states where the polls are tight, including Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and in Michigan.

Lesley Stahl: Can you characterize your supporters?

President Donald Trump: Yeah, I think I can. People that love our country. More than anything else and they like to see our country thrive.

Lesley Stahl: But do you think that when you hold rallies and encourage people to say, ""Lock her up,"" the way you---

President Donald Trump: I don't encourage them. They say it.

Lesley Stahl: And you enjoy it-- You don't say, ""Don't do that--""

President Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton, let-- let me just tell you-- Hillary Clinton deleted, she deleted 33,000 emails after she got a subpoena from the United States Congress.

Lesley Stahl: But why is this still an issue? Why do people, they're not gonna vote on that--

President Donald Trump: I think it's an issue. To me it's an issue.

Lesley Stahl: She ran last time.

President Donald Trump: Excuse me. When they say ""Lock her up,"" it's not me. They say it. It starts, it-- it ends up being--

Lesley Stahl: You encourage it.

President Donald Trump: I don't encourage it.

Lesley Stahl: Yes, you do.

President Donald Trump: No. If I mention her name about something, they go crazy.

Lesley Stahl: Well, what about the governor of Michigan?

Governor Gretchen Whitmer was the target of a kidnapping plot by an armed militia group.

President Donald Trump: It was our Justice Department that is the one that's helping her. My Justice Department, if you call it that--

Lesley Stahl: Yes, yes the FBI.

President Donald Trump: It was our Justice Department that's helping her. And, you know, people aren't so-- they're not liking her so much, because she's got everybody locked down.

President Donald Trump at rally: You've gotta get your governor to open up your state, okay...

Crowd: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!

President Donald Trump at rally: Lock 'em all up.

Lesley Stahl: You are-- very powerful, and the people who love you, love you with passion. And if you go after somebody the way you've been going after her, they take it to heart--

President Donald Trump: I haven't gone after her.

Lesley Stahl: --and they, then there are plots and threats, and the same with Dr.--

President Donald Trump: I haven't gone after her.

Lesley Stahl: You did.

President Donald Trump: I've helped her. It was our Justice Department--

Lesley Stahl: You did go after-- You-- you criticized her--

President Donald Trump: --that's helping her. Oh, I do criticize her, yeah.

Lesley Stahl: Well, that's goin' after her--

President Donald Trump: I think the way she locked down Michigan is a disgrace.

Lesley Stahl: but when you--

President Donald Trump: The way she closed churches in Michigan is a disgrace. I-- yeah, I think it's disgraceful what she's done. I do.

Lesley Stahl: You want to lock her up?

President Donald Trump: And, by the way, that's other-. Of course, I don't want to lock her up. Why would I lock her up?

Lesley Stahl: 'Cause you were in front of a rally of people saying it, encouraging it.

President Donald Trump: Lesley, it's such a vicious thing you just said. I never said, ""Lock up the governor of Michigan."" I would never say that.

Lesley Stahl: Do you take any responsibility for the country being divided against itself? Do you feel that?

President Donald Trump: I'd like not to, but, you know, perhaps everybody has to take a little responsibility for it. But when people put out phony witch hunts, you know, when they spy on your campaign, you have to fight back. And if you don't fight back, you're not sitting here very long. You go back home.

President Donald Trump: You go back home to mommy.

As we moved from subject to subject, our conversation grew more tense. President Trump brought up what he calls the unfairness of the fake media. Most prominently: a lack of coverage of his unproven and unverified charges that former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, have received millions of dollars in corrupt payments from a Russian oligarch and a Chinese billionaire.

President Donald Trump: I wish you would interview Joe Biden like you interview me. It would be so good. You know what?

Lesley Stahl: You like this, I thought-

President Donald Trump: The, the--

Lesley Stahl: I thought you liked spy-- sparring--

President Donald Trump: I don't mind it. I don't mind it. But when I watch him walk out of a store, and he's walking with an ice cream. And the question the media asks him, ""What kind of ice cream? What flavor ice cream do you have?"" And he's in the midst of a scandal.

Lesley Stahl: He's not.

President Donald Trump: And he's taking

Lesley Stahl: He's not, no--

President Donald Trump: Of course he is, Lesley.

Lesley Stahl: Come on.

President Donald Trump: Of course he is.

President Donald Trump: It's the biggest -- second-biggest scandal. The biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign. They spied on my campaign, Lesley-

Lesley Stahl: Well, there's no-- real evidence of that.

President Donald Trump: Of course there is. It's all over--

Lesley Stahl: No--

President Donald Trump: --the place. Lesley, they--

Lesley Stahl: Sir--

President Donald Trump: --spied on my campaign and they got caught--

Lesley Stahl: Can I-- can I say something? You know, this is 60 Minutes. And we can't put on things we can't verify--

President Donald Trump: No, you won't put it on because it's bad for Biden. Look, let me tell you--

Lesley Stahl: We can't put on things we can't verify--

President Donald Trump: Lesley, they spied on--

Lesley Stahl: And--

President Donald Trump: --on my campaign.

Lesley Stahl: Well, we can't verify that--

President Donald Trump: It's been totally verified.

Lesley Stahl: No.

President Donald Trump: It's been-- just go down and get the papers. They spied on my campaign, they got caught.

Lesley Stahl: No.

President Donald Trump: And then they went much further than that and they got caught. And you will see that, Lesley. And you know that. But you just don't wanna put it on the air--

Lesley Stahl: No-- as a matter of fact, I don't know that.

President Donald Trump: Okay.

Lesley Stahl: And you're out there--

President Donald Trump: So why don't you get back to your interview, and let's go.

Lesley Stahl: Do you think that your tweets and your name-calling are turning people off?

President Donald Trump: No, I think I wouldn't be here if I didn't have social media.

President Donald Trump: But the media is fake. And frankly, if I didn't have social media, I'd have no way of getting out my voice.

Lesley Stahl: Do you know what you told me a long time ago when I asked why you keep saying ""fake m-- media""--

President Donald Trump: Yeah? Yeah?

Lesley Stahl: You said to me, ""I say that because I need to dis-- discredit you so that when you say negative things about me, no one will believe you.""

President Donald Trump: I don't have to discredit you.

Lesley Stahl: But that's what you told me--

President Donald Trump: You've discredited yourself.

Lesley Stahl: You know, I didn't want to have this kind of angry--

President Trump walks out of his interview with 60 Minutes

President Donald Trump: Of course you did.

Lesley Stahl: No, I didn't--

President Donald Trump: Of course you did--

Lesley Stahl: --no, I didn't.

President Donald Trump: Well, then you brought up a lot of subjects that were inappropriately brought up--

Lesley Stahl: Well, I said, I'm gonna ask you tough questions. But--

President Donald Trump: They were inappropriately brought up. Right from the beginning. No, your first question was, ""This is going to be tough questions."" You don't ask Joe Biden, I saw your interview with Joe, the interview with Joe Biden.

Lesley Stahl: I never did a Joe Biden interview-

President Donald Trump: It was a joke. The interview, 60 Minutes. I see Joe Biden, giving softball after softball. I've seen all of his interviews. He's never been asked a question that's hard.

Lesley Stahl: Okay, but forget him for a minute. You're President--

President Donald Trump: No, but you start with me.

Lesley Stahl: You're President, and-

President Donald Trump: Excuse me, Lesley, you started with me. Your first statement was, ""Are you ready for tough questions?""

Lesley Stahl: Are you?

President Donald Trump: That's no way to talk. That's no way to talk.

Producer: Lesley, one, one second.

At this point one of our producers interrupted to advise about the time remaining in the interview.

President Donald Trump: I think we have enough of an interview here, Hope. Okay? That's enough. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go meet for two seconds, okay? Thanks. I'll see you in a little while. Thanks.

Lesley Stahl: Be careful.

We were scheduled to take a walk with the president around the White House grounds.

Lesley Stahl: I've got a lot of questions I didn't ask.



While we waited to see if the president was coming back, his press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, came in with a hand delivery.

Kayleigh McEnany: Lesley, the president wanted me to deliver his health care plan, it's a little heavy.

Lesley Stahl: Oh my god. This is his health care plan?

Kayleigh McEnany: Yes.

Lesley Stahl: Okay. Kayleigh, thank you.

Kayleigh McEnany: You're welcome and the Vice President will be with you shortly.

Lesley Stahl: Okay. And the president's not coming back?

Kayleigh McEnany: The president's given you a lot of time.

It was heavy. Filled with executive orders, congressional initiatives, but no comprehensive health plan.

Vice President Mike Pence: Hello, Lesley.

Lesley Stahl: Hi, Mr. Vice President.

Vice President Mike Pence

While our interview with the president did not go forward, the one scheduled with the vice president did.

Lesley Stahl: So what just happened with the president?

Vice President Mike Pence: Lesley, President Trump is a man who speaks his mind. I think it's one of the great strengths that he's had--

Lesley Stahl: But he walked out--

Vice President Mike Pence: --as president of the United States, is that the American people always know where they stand.

Lesley Stahl: I'll buy that—

Vice President Mike Pence: And he's always ready. And the American people know that-- in this time, it's, it's-- it's less about the back and forth with the media, and it's-- it's really more about how we bring this country all the way back.

We then asked the vice president to put on his hat as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

Lesley Stahl: Dr. Fauci. You know the president said that he's a disaster, and he and the-- other public health officials around him are idiots. Do you care to comment on that?

Vice President Mike Pence: The scientists who've worked around the White House Coronavirus Task Force, who will meet again today here at the White House have provided a great public service. They've--

Lesley Stahl: So not idiots--

Vice President Mike Pence: --brought the perspective of scientists all along the way. And I have-- I have a strong relationship with Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx but remember, the president of the United States has to consider the whole of America. The president's been balancing the broad interests of the country—and the health of the American people, and we'll continue to do that every day.

Lesley Stahl: So let's say there's a mother out there. Let's say in a hot spot in Wisconsin. And she's wondering whether she should send her children to school. Now, w-- what's your advice?

Vice President Mike Pence: Lesley, we gotta get our kids back in school. And I would say to that mother, or any mother, that we're gonna continue to work our hearts out to make sure that those schools have the testing, have the PPE, have the supplies they need to get our kids back where they belong, safe and sound, in the classroom.

Lesley Stahl: So are you saying she should send the kids back? Should the kids wear masks?

Vice President Mike Pence: I think they should adhere to whatever criteria the school administrators and local health officials determine to be appropriate. But really, again, I wanna say, the American Academy of Pediatricians made it clear early on that distance learning, this online learning, is no substitute for being in the classroom.

Lesley Stahl: What about Thanksgiving? Should people feel safe to get together with their family? With their grandparents? With their aunts and uncles?

Vice President Mike Pence: Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays.

Lesley Stahl: Me too.

Vice President Mike Pence: And-- and I'm looking forward to it with our family.

Lesley Stahl: With a big-- with extended?

Vice President Mike Pence: I think that's a decision every American family can make based on the circumstances in their community, the vulnerability of particular family members. Now, one of the things we apprehended early on is that seniors, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are the most at-risk-- for a serious outcome if they contract the coronavirus. And so w-- families may make a decision that-- that certain elderly family members might take a pass but I think the difference between President Trump and me and some of the public voices in this debate over the last year has been we trust the American people.

Escaped cloned female mutant crayfish take over Belgian cemetery - NZ Herald,4,ji6yc7,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/escaped-cloned-female-mutant-crayfish-take-over-belgian-cemetery/YZDGK4GTJKKML7Y76OELOTHGPA/,3,1603709878.0,,"The crayfish have taken root in the pools and streams of the Schoonselhof cemetery. Photo / 123rf

Escaped self-cloning mutant crayfish created in experimental breeding programmes have invaded a Belgian cemetery.

Hundreds of the duplicating crustaceans, which can dig down to up to a metre and are always female, pose a deadly threat to local biodiversity after colonising a historic Antwerp graveyard.

""It's impossible to round up all of them. It's like trying to empty the ocean with a thimble,"" said Kevin Scheers, of the Flemish Institute for Nature and Woodland Research.

Marbled crayfish, which travel across land and water at night and eat whatever they can, do not occur in nature and are banned by the European Union.

Instead, the freshwater beasts, which are about 10cm big and voracious, are thought to have been bred by unscrupulous German pet traders in the 1990s.

They are similar to the slough crayfish found in Florida but are parthenogenetic, which means they reproduce with themselves and all their children are genetically identical females.

The mutation, which occurred about 25 years ago, means populations can spring up rapidly from just a single Procambarus virginalis.

In 2018, scientists established the global marbled crayfish population was descended from a single female and didn't need males to reproduce.

The EU banned possession and release of the uncanny crayfish in 2014 but it is impossible to trace the owners because all the crayfish are genetically exactly the same.

The crayfish have taken root in the pools and streams of the Schoonselhof cemetery in Antwerp, which is known as the Flemish city's Pere Lachaise.

John Rankin Rathbone, a British MP killed in action in 1940, is among the famous people memorialised there.

Once again, the pet trade is to blame for the infestation at the cemetery, where the bodies of 1577 British commonwealth soldiers killed in World War II lie.

""Someone apparently had the animal in their aquarium, and then set it free in a canal,"" Scheers told the Brussels Times website.

""Often people get tired of their animals or the marbled crayfish population is getting too large at home.""

The beasts, which are the only known decapod crustaceans to solo-reproduce, have already been spotted elsewhere in Antwerp and in Leuven, another city in Flanders.

""The marbled crayfish ... crawls around both in the water and over land at night,"" Scheers said. ""That's how they move to other canals and pools.""

Belgian law prohibits the poisoning of the crayfish, which was a method of control used in Spain.

The crayfish has spread rapidly through Africa and Europe and has been compared to the tribbles, a fictional alien species in Star Trek that reproduces extremely quickly.

Scientists hope the science-fiction shellfish's incredible adaptability may help them understand how cancer tumours adapt to their environment by developing resistance to certain drugs.

Both the crayfish and tumours have ""epigenetic mechanisms"". This helps them adapt to different environments by switching certain genes on or off.

The animal has been reported in countries including Austria, Germany, France, Japan, Madagascar and Israel and is present in four continents. The pet trade has been blamed for the population explosion.

It is particularly prevalent in Madagascar where its rapid spread in less than a decade is because of its popularity as a cheap source of protein. Researchers have found that the marbled crayfish could out-compete seven native crayfish."
US reports second-highest day of coronavirus cases since the pandemic began. The highest day was Friday,276,ji0jsc,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/25/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html,45,1603686663.0,,"(CNN) As the US reports its second-highest day of new Covid-19 cases amid the continuing fall surge , a former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration says it may be time for a national mask mandate.

In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Dr. Scott Gottlieb wrote the mandate could be ""limited and temporary.""

""A mandate can be expressly limited to the next two months,"" Gottlieb wrote, adding that it's easier to wear a mask in the winter than the summer. ""The inconvenience would allow the country to preserve health-care capacity and keep more schools and businesses open.""

With deaths expected to rise this winter, policymakers will have to make moves to slow the spread, Gottlieb wrote. There already is no support for reinstating the stay-at-home orders from the spring.

If 95% of Americans wore masks in public, more than 100,000 lives could be saved in the United States through February, according to data released Friday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

""If people are not wearing masks, then maybe we should be mandating it,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday

Gottlieb wrote the concern about needing fines to enforce the mandate leading to confrontations with police isn't necessarily true.

""States should be able to choose how to enforce a mandate, but the goal should be to make masks a social and cultural norm, not a political statement,"" he wrote. ""Mandating masks has become divisive only because it was framed that way by some politicians and commentators.""

Gottlieb was appointed FDA commissioner by President Trump and served from May 2017 to May 2019. He is now a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank in Washington, DC.

Saturday saw 83,718 new Covid-19 cases, just 39 cases shy of the all-time record that was reported Friday. Already, national cases total more than 8.6 million and 225,212 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins.

""We're at a dangerous tipping point right now,"" Gottlieb told Margaret Brennan Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""We're entering what's going to be the steep slope of the curve, of the epidemic curve.""

Social gatherings and family events moving indoors to avoid the colder weather is largely to blame for the high rates of spread, officials said over the weekend.

In Maryland, the governor said this week family gatherings were the No. 1 source of transmission in the state, followed by house parties. In North Carolina, health officials reported its highest daily case count Friday and said they continue to see clusters ""from social and religious gatherings.""

At least 35 states report rise in cases

The Florida Department of Health on Sunday reported 2,385 additional coronavirus cases and 12 new resident deaths.

Florida has recorded a total of 778,636 Covid-19 cases statewide and 16,429 Floridian deaths, DOH data shows.

At least 35 states reported more new Covid-19 cases in the last week than the week prior, according to Johns Hopkins data.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Saturday reported an additional 1,994 coronavirus cases -- the highest single-day total since May.

""We're still in the midst of a pandemic and need everyone to take this seriously. Wear a mask. Social distance,"" Murphy tweeted.

New Jersey had eight new virus-related deaths, bringing the state's total fatality toll to 14,492.

""This virus has not gone away simply because we are tired of it,"" Murphy said.

Pennsylvania reported 2,043 new cases Saturday.

""Daily increases are now comparable with what we saw in April 2020,"" the state health department said in a statement. An additional 29 virus-related deaths were reported Saturday.

Michigan, with 3,338 new cases Saturday, marked its highest single-day total during the pandemic, according to state Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin. The state also reported 35 new deaths.

Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan's chief medical executive and chief deputy for health, said the data showed ""alarming increases"" in new infections.

""If rates continue like this, we risk overwhelming our hospitals and having many more Michiganders die,"" Khaldun said in a statement.

In Texas, El Paso County has seen such a surge in Covid-19 cases that it is instituting a curfew between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said during a Sunday night virtual press conference.

The curfew will be in place for the next two weeks with an exception for those who need to go to work for essential services, Samaniego said.

The county has seen a 160% increase in positivity rate since October 1 and a 300% increase in hospitalizations, the judge said.

The Texas Division of Emergency Management is establishing an alternate care site in El Paso to expand hospital capacity, according to Gov. Greg Abbott's office. The facility will open Monday and provide additional beds, equipment and personnel.

Abbott said extra medical staff will be able to help with surge capacity to ""reduce the strain on hospitals.""

Fauci: Widespread vaccination not possible until 2021

Fauci said Sunday that experts will know by early December whether a potential coronavirus vaccine is safe and effective, but widespread vaccination will probably not be possible until later next year.

""We will know whether a vaccine is safe and effective by the end of November, beginning of December,"" he told the BBC. ""The amount of doses that will be available in December will not certainly be enough to vaccinate everybody -- you'll have to wait several months into 2021.""

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Fauci added that the vaccination of a ""substantial proportion of the population"" such that there can be a ""significant impact on the dynamics of the outbreak"" would likely not be possible until the second or third quarter of 2021.

""What I do foresee is that with a successful vaccine and the continuation of some form of public health measures, as we go and progress through the months of 2021, getting towards the third and fourth quarter, we will see a considerable approach towards some form of normality,"" Fauci told Marr.

Gottlieb also pointed out that even if a vaccine becomes available this year and goes to the first group of patients, likely the elderly and health care workers, they won't have protective immunity until some point in 2021.

""This vaccine is not going to affect the contours of what we're going to go through, which is going to play out in the next two or three months,"" he said.

National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Friday that while he's ""cautiously optimistic"" about the US having a vaccine authorized by the end of the year, he said it ""might not happen and it might take longer."""

While Sunday’s vote is only a procedural step, it underscores that Republicans have the votes to place Barrett on the Supreme Court just days before the Nov. 3 election. The timetable will set a new record for how close to a presidential election a nominee has been confirmed to the country’s highest court.

Republicans argue that the political shift from 2016, when a Democrat was in the White House, to 2020, when Republicans control both the Senate and the presidency, is a key distinction in line with precedent.

Democrats, however, fumed as Republicans quickly made it clear they would rally behind McConnell’s pledge to give whomever Trump nominated to succeed Ginsburg a vote. Similar to 2016, when McConnell waited only hours to announce the Senate would not take up a successor for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the GOP leader quickly made it clear after Ginsburg’s death that he would bring up Trump’s nominee.

Democrats have unsuccessfully tried dozens of times over the past week to delay Barrett’s nomination, including with attempts to adjourn the Senate until Nov. 9 or take up and begin debates on long-stalled legislative priorities. In Saturday’s hours-long session alone, they tried to take up roughly two dozen bills; each maneuver was blocked by Republicans.

Republicans expect Democrats to keep the Senate in session throughout Sunday night to give speeches about Barrett’s nomination before the final vote on Monday.

But Democrats have acknowledged that, absent the help of four GOP senators, they are powerless to prevent Republicans from placing Barrett on the court just days before the election and in time to take part in the Nov. 10 case that could determine the fate of the Affordable Care Act.

Collins, who is in a tough reelection bid, is the only Republican expected to vote against Barrett on Monday. Collins said she was voting against Barrett because she does not believe Republicans should move her nomination before the election, after refusing to take up Garland in 2016.

""To be clear, my vote does not reflect any conclusion that I have reached about Judge Barrett’s qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. What I have concentrated on is being fair and consistent, and I do not think it is fair nor consistent to have a Senate confirmation vote prior to the election,"" Collins said in a statement on Sunday.

Democrats have argued that the reason Republicans are moving quickly to get Barrett on the court is so she can hear the health care case and so she can hear any election-related cases if the outcome of Nov. 3 ends up before the Supreme Court. Trump has indicated that he wants the Supreme Court to strike down ObamaCare and that he believes nine justices are needed in case the election is contested.

Barrett, during her days-long confirmation hearing, largely sidestepped weighing in on the presidential election and declined to say if she would recuse herself from election-related cases, if she thought a president should commit to a peaceful transition of power or if a president could unilaterally delay the election.

Despite the high stakes of confirming Barrett, who will lock in a 6-3 conservative majority on the court, and the injection of election-year drama, there have been no eleventh-hour surprises that threatened to derail GOP support for Trump's nominee.

Barrett also got a surprise boost when Murkowski announced that she would ultimately support Barrett during Monday’s confirmation vote, despite her objections to the decision to hold a vote before the election.

""While I oppose the process that has led us to this point, I do not hold it against her as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility,” Murkowski said on Saturday. “I will vote no on the procedural votes ahead of us but yes to confirm Judge Barrett when the question before us is her qualification to be an associate justice.”

Mike DeWine for tyranny, local news station WSYX reported.

The plot reportedly came to the attention of law enforcement when a man contacted them to say someone had called him in an attempt to recruit him to the plan.

On Thursday, a group gathered in front of the Ohio statehouse as a woman swore an oath of office and declared herself governor, according to local WSYX reporter Geoff Redick, who said he confirmed it was the same woman involved in the alleged kidnapping plot.

The plot resembled a report earlier this month that the FBI had foiled a right-wing militia's plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and overthrow the state government.

The plot came to law enforcement's attention when a man contacted them to say someone had tried to recruit him to the plan. The man who reported the plot said he had previously tried to have DeWine removed from office by filing charges of tyranny against him, but that he was not interested in operating outside the law.

His attempts to bring charges against the Republican governor were dismissed by the state. According to WSYX, he said when he received a phone call from a woman about kidnapping the governor for tyranny, he declined and told her he would be contacting the Piqua Police Department.

""At this point in my life I'm not shocked by anything,"" DeWine told WSYX reporter Geoff Redick. ""People in every state believe they can take the law into their own hands, that they have every right to basically go and overthrow the government.""

DeWine added: ""It's incumbent on all of us to denounce that, no matter where it's coming from.""

On October 22, a group gathered in front of the Ohio statehouse as a woman swore an oath of office and declared herself governor, according to Redick. He said he confirmed it was the same woman involved in the alleged kidnapping plot. The woman also reportedly said DeWine was now on ""house arrest.""

As the woman is not currently facing criminal charges, she has remained unidentified in reports on the plot.

The plot comes weeks after the FBI foiled a right-wing militia's plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and overthrow the state government. Several people involved in that plot discussed murdering ""tyrants"" or ""taking"" a sitting government, according to an FBI affidavit."

They believed their differences weren’t so vast. They believed they could talk to one another. They thought compromise might even come of it.

They were part of an experiment that brought 526 Americans, demographically and politically representative of all registered voters, to a conference center outside Dallas last September. They spent several days debating climate change, the economy and immigration — mostly respectfully. And many left feeling hopeful that American politics writ large could resemble something so civil. That was before the impeachment, the pandemic, the civil unrest and the recession. Before protesters clashed in Portland, Ore., and Kenosha, Wis., and before angry voters rallied against mask mandates and lockdowns. Now, in follow-up interviews a year later, some of the most optimistic voters in America sound, instead, despondent. “It’s really unfortunate, outside of that bubble that we had in Dallas, seeing this untamed beast that is the real world,” said Keagan Casey, a 24-year-old Republican from Providence, R.I. “It just isn’t civil, it isn’t constructive, and it’s really not conducive to us moving forward as a country as united.” Over this rancorous election year, however, the Stanford political scientists who conceived of this immersive lesson in deliberative democracy, called America in One Room, believe it continued to influence the voters. In surveys conducted a year later by NORC at the University of Chicago, these voters said they paid more attention to the presidential campaign than a similar control group of voters. To a greater extent, they’ve disapproved of the government’s coronavirus response. And most strikingly, voters at the Texas event who placed themselves in the middle of the political spectrum were much more likely to say they supported Joe Biden — even to a degree that surprised the researchers. We were there in Texas, too, and we took a portrait of nearly everyone who participated. This time, with their permission, we’ve grouped many of them by party identification, with a sample of their voting intentions in their own words. The result captures a mix of that Texas experience and the real world: American voters, still largely bound by their party alliances, but trying to reach a more reasoned decision. Republicans Grouped together, these voters reflect broad demographic differences between the two parties. But each portrait also evokes, more than a tallied vote ever could, the individual behind the choice, beyond partisan bubbles.

Republican voters at the Texas event (a sample of them shown here) support President Trump by roughly 90 percent to 4 percent. 1 Larry Oakdale, Calif.

Mr. Casey, the Republican from Providence, is not what many people expect him to be. He is gay and, by his own description, very conservative — a combination he says even his own friends struggle to understand. He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. But while he supported the president’s tax policies and Supreme Court nominees, he increasingly couldn’t support the man himself. Then came the pandemic. “That’s what really was the nail in the coffin,” said Mr. Casey, who works in health care, coordinating clinical research. The president failed to adequately respond to the virus, he said. So Mr. Casey plans to write in Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations and the kind of Republican — moderate and level-headed, in Mr. Casey’s estimation — he hopes he will one day be able to help elect. Among Republicans we interviewed backing Mr. Trump, some said they’d grown more supportive of him over the past four years as he’d kept many of his campaign promises; others said they would vote for him again but with more trepidation. Beverly Lucas, a 73-year-old Republican, described herself as living in an affluent white bubble in the Dallas suburb of Frisco. The America in One Room event jolted her from that comfort, she said. It reminded her of what it’s like to be surrounded by people different from her, and to grapple more deeply with her political views. “I’ve led a sheltered life, and I want to change that,” she said. On the day we reached her, she had just put her home on the market. She plans to move to an apartment in a more diverse community in Cary, N.C., where she knows no one. And she has been thinking more about her political values, with all the forced time for reflection the pandemic has given her. A lifelong Republican, she said she had often voted for what seemed best for her wallet. This year, she is voting out of her deep concern for abortion. “I voted for Trump again,” Ms. Lucas said. “But I did it with eyes wide open and for my reasons, not for anybody else’s reasons.” Independents and those who lean to either party Among the America in One Room group, Mr. Biden’s advantage comes primarily from voters who describe themselves as either independents or “leaning” toward one party or the other. They back Mr. Biden by about 25 points, compared with just a seven-point lead for him among moderate and independent voters in the control group. That’s a stunning difference. Few events — including the president’s impeachment and the pandemic — have moved public opinion anywhere near that much. Some hard-to-detect underlying characteristics may set these voters apart from typical moderates and independents (research suggests many of them aren’t actually that independent). Perhaps the voters at the Texas event, who agreed to fly across the country to talk politics with strangers, are more open to new experiences or new information. But the researchers who organized the event say they think the experience itself helped shape voting intentions. And if that experience explains even a quarter of the overall result, that would be a significant effect.

Independent voters at the Texas event (a sample of them shown here), including those who said they lean to either party, support Joe Biden by roughly 53 percent to 28 percent. 1 Benjamin Sangerville, Me. The presumptive two-party system, I feel it is actually destructive to our democracy and our country.

Mike LaPointe, a 64-year-old independent in Clio, Mich., used to consider himself a solidly Republican voter, and he voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. He had followed current events mostly by watching Fox News. After the Texas event, he said, he made an effort to expand his information sources: to read Reuters, national newspapers and daily email newsletters. He is trying to avoid “tunnel vision,” he said. Mr. LaPointe has been paying more attention to the news this year, reflecting the trend in the America in One Room survey data, and he has been particularly troubled by the pandemic and the president’s handling of it. “That’s based on my personal observations and just watching him — it wasn’t twisted by the news,” said Mr. LaPointe, who is now edging toward Mr. Biden. “I watched and listened to a lot.” His experience mirrors what the researchers believe has happened this year. James Fishkin and Larry Diamond, two of the political scientists who pioneered the concept of “deliberative polls,” say that voters become more informed, and even moderate their views, when they’re pulled into a room together and given neutral information to discuss. Their model of deliberative democracy isn’t meant to lead to skewed support for one candidate, or one party. But in this highly unusual year, one issue has dominated the news — the pandemic — and scientific and health experts have largely found the president wanting on that issue. “We may never see another case like this,” Mr. Fishkin said. “But for me, it’s proof of concept in that it shows a long-term deliberative effect is possible. And this is more than a year later.” Voters at America in One Room never talked about the pandemic; the novel coronavirus wasn’t known to exist then. But they practiced some skills that could prove useful in thinking about a public health emergency that becomes politicized. “What they learned in deliberation — at least for some of them – is you don’t just accept what your party says,” said Norman Bradburn, a senior fellow at NORC, which also collaborated on the project alongside Helena, a nonpartisan group that funded and helped organize it. “You think a little bit more about it. You ask questions. You deliberate, even if you only do it with yourself.” George Baldwin, an independent who changed his Republican registration after the 2016 election, said he followed as the federal government failed to better coordinate protective equipment and coronavirus testing. He noticed when the president called growing concern over the pandemic a new hoax. He was paying attention when Mr. Trump called Dr. Anthony Fauci a “disaster.” “If you had said to somebody in Dallas a year ago that a pandemic would be something that would divide the country as opposed to uniting us, it would have probably been met with a fair amount of disbelief,” said Mr. Baldwin, 62, who lives in West New York, N.J. He has already cast his ballot for Mr. Biden. Democrats Collectively, this group of Democrats reflects the party’s racial diversity. In interviews, they described many of the same fears as Republicans who have watched polarization in the country worsen.

Democratic voters at the Texas event (a sample of them shown here) support Joe Biden by roughly 98 percent to 1 percent. 1 Brian Menomonie, Wis.

"Kansas county spends $350K of COVID-19 relief money on cameras for soccer park, sparking backlash",77,jhg2km,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/522582-kansas-county-spends-350k-of-covid-19-relief-money-on-soccer-park,5,1603600087.0,,"A city council in Kansas is facing backlash over a plan to allocate $350,000 in federal coronavirus relief aid to purchase cameras for a local soccer complex.

The Overland Park City Council this week voted 10-2 to purchase cameras and video equipment to broadcast games at Scheels Soccer Complex, The Kansas City Star reported.

According to the proposal, Overland Park will grant Musco Sports Lighting the license to stream the games on its platform, giving the city 70 percent of the revenue generated from people paying to watch or download them.

Officials reportedly argued that streaming the games online would help stem the spread of the coronavirus because it would prevent crowds of spectators from gathering.

Faris Farassati was one of the two council members who voted against the purchase, along with Scott Hamblin. They called it an inappropriate use of federal funds, according to the outlet.

During the city council meeting, where residents shared their concerns, Farassati was reportedly met with applause when he condemned the motion.

“When we look at the CARES Act and where this country is going with the economy, people are losing jobs. People are not able to pay rent. People are not able to pay utilities. I personally do not find it necessary to buy a bunch of expensive cameras to essentially make money,” Farassati said, according to the Star.

Other council members defended the proposal.

“This is an appropriate program,” Councilman Chris Newlin, who voted for the plan, told local affiliate Fox 4. “We followed the rules. We filled out an application, and we asked for this.”

Newlin, who is also a soccer coach at the complex, according to the outlet, said he has not seen regular social distancing at games.

“The parents are right there next to each other,” Newlin told the network. “Yes, they have masks on, but they’re not social distancing.”

Maury Thompson, the deputy county manager, reportedly said that county officials had determined Overland Park’s requested funding for the soccer complex was eligible for funding from the CARES Act that Congress passed in March.

“In my professional opinion and that of our national consultant who is consulting with the [U.S.] Treasury, this is clearly an allowable expense,” Thompson said this week, the Star reported. “I understand the concerns, but this is clearly an allowable, eligible expense.”

However, Thompson reportedly acknowledged that “we were not aware this was a soccer complex installation.”

Documents obtained by the newspaper showed that Overland Park requested $350,000 for “video broadcasting platform” expenses but did not mention it would be used for sports or for the soccer complex.

“Live broadcasting is an effective strategy to protect staff, players and our community, including those at an elevated risk of COVID-19, while allowing operations to maintain healthy operational conditions,” the application stated.

Farassati and Hamblin said they are asking the city council to rescind the vote approving the funding.

Overall, Overland Park has been approved by the county to obtained more than $2.5 million in funding from the CARES Act. The $350,000 for the soccer complex cameras is the second-most expensive item on the list, according to documents provided to the Star.

The most expensive allocation was an estimated $455,000 for software and technology for emergency management operations."
Exclusive: U.S. State Department suspends all diversity training after Trump's directive,426,jh8xqp,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-statedepartment-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-state-department-suspends-all-diversity-training-after-trumps-directive-idUSKBN2790JC,73,1603575003.0,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has suspended all training programs for employees related to diversity and inclusion, an internal cable obtained by Reuters showed, after President Donald Trump directed federal agencies last month to end programs deemed divisive by the White House.

People enter and leave State Department Building in Washington, U.S., January 26, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

“Beginning Friday, October 23, 2020, the Department is temporarily pausing all training programs related to diversity and inclusion in accordance with Executive Order ... on Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping,” the cable said.

“The pause will allow time for the Department and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to review program content,” it said.

Trump’s Sept. 22 executive order forbid the teaching by federal agencies of “divisive concepts” including that the United States is “fundamentally racist or sexist.”

The order followed a Sept. 4 memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget that told officials at federal agencies they could not use taxpayer dollars to fund “un-American propaganda sessions” that provided instruction about critical race theory, white privilege or “taught that the United States is an inherently racist or evil” country.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the cable.

The move comes less than two weeks before the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which the debate about racial injustice in the United States has been fueled by police killings of Black Americans that sparked nationwide protests over the summer.

During the first debate with his Democratic rival Joe Biden, Trump defended his executive order saying the training programs were teaching people “very bad ideas.”

“And really, they were teaching people to hate our country and I’m not going to do that,” Trump said at the Sept. 29 debate. “They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place.”

Biden, who has accused Trump of racism, leads by 8 percentage points nationally, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, with 51% of likely voters say they are backing the Democratic challenger while 43% are voting for the president.

At the pair’s second debate, on Thursday, Trump denied the accusations and said he was least racist person in the room.

‘APPROVED PROGRAMS’

With its 76,000 employees globally and representing the face of America in the world, State Department has had a mixed track record on diversity, with racial and ethnic minorities still underrepresented, particularly in senior ranks, according to an independent federal watchdog report released earlier this year.

“Longstanding diversity issues persist,” said the report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, concluding that while the overall proportion of racial or ethnic minorities at the agency has grown, proportions of African Americans and women have declined.

The State Department cable said it was in regular contact with OMB to discuss the ‘effective implementation’ of the executive order and minimize the time needed for review to ensure ‘approved programs’ can resume in a timely fashion.

It also said the Foreign Service Institute (FSI), which trains American diplomats, will collect the relevant training materials and submit them for review.

“As the senior Department official responsible for ensuring compliance with Executive Order 13950, I share the Department’s strong commitment to building an inclusive and diverse workforce to effectively deliver on our national security and foreign policy mission goals,” Brian Bulatao, undersecretary for management at the State Department, told employees in the cable."
"No evidence for Trump claim that Joe Biden earned money in China, according to the Wall Street Journal, contradicting its editorial section",440,jgt2ls,https://www.businessinsider.com/no-evidence-trump-claim-joe-biden-earned-money-in-china-2020-10,45,1603507309.0,,"The Wall Street Journal found no evidence to support President Trump's claim that Joe Biden did business in China.

The Journal's reporters reviewed corporate records, emails, and text messages.

Trump's claim, during Thursday's debate, came the same week it was revealed he himself had a secret bank account in China.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had no role in a proposed investment venture in China, according to corporate records, emails, and text messages reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

At Thursday night's debate, President Donald Trump repeatedly asserted that Biden was involved in his son Hunter's business dealings, specifically accusing him of taking money from China — a charge he made the same week it was revealed he himself had secretly maintained a bank account in the country.

But there is no evidence to support the president's accusation that the former vice president was ever involved in his son's business dealings, in China or elsewhere.

Indeed, text messages and emails provided by the original source for the claim, Anthony Bobulinksi, ""don't show either Hunter Biden or James Biden [the vice president's younger brother] discussing a role for Joe Biden in the venture,"" The Journal reported Thursday night.

Prior to Thursday's debate, Bobulinksi held a press conference where he alleged that Joe Biden took part in a 2017 meeting, when he was a private citizen, to discuss a proposed investment opportunity in China. He cited an email from another investor, James Gillar, referring to a potential equity share for a ""big guy,"" claiming that was a reference to Biden.

""I am unaware of any involvement at any time of the former vice president,"" Gillar, a former business partner of Hunter, told The Journal. Of the proposed investment opportunity in China, he added: ""The activity in question never delivered any project revenue.""

In a statement issued Wednesday night to the New York Post, a right-wing tabloid, Bobulinski claimed the proposed investment was between him ""and the Biden family,"" an assertion that The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page took as evidence that ""Joe Biden was accepting influence payments, including from Chinese entities.""

But corporate records reviewed by journalists at the paper — owned by the same parent company as the Post and Fox News — provided no evidence for that.

A spokesperson for Joe Biden told The Journal the former vice president ""has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever.""

"Charges: Boogaloo Bois fired on Minneapolis police precinct, shouted 'Justice for Floyd'",118,jgqsb4,https://www.startribune.com/charges-boogaloo-bois-fired-on-minneapolis-police-precinct-shouted-justice-for-floyd/572843802/,14,1603500353.0,,"In the wake of protests following the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a member of the Boogaloo Bois opened fire on the Minneapolis Police Third Precinct with an AK-47-style gun and screamed “Justice for Floyd” as he ran away, according to a federal complaint made public Friday.

A sworn affidavit by the FBI underlying the complaint reveals new details about a far-right anti-government group’s coordinated role in the violence that roiled through civil unrest over Floyd’s death while in police custody.

Ivan Harrison Hunter, a 26-year-old from Boerne, Texas, is charged with one count of interstate travel to incite a riot for his alleged role in ramping up violence during the protests in Minneapolis on May 27 and 28. According to charges, Hunter, wearing a skull mask and tactical gear, shot 13 rounds at the south Minneapolis police headquarters while people were inside. He also looted and helped set the building ablaze, according to the complaint, which was filed Monday under seal.

Unrest flared throughout Minneapolis following Floyd’s death, which was captured on a bystander’s cellphone video, causing Gov. Tim Walz to activate the Minnesota National Guard. As police clashed with protesters, Hunter and other members of the Boogaloo Bois discussed in private Facebook messages their plans to travel to Minneapolis and rally at the Cub Foods near the Third Precinct building, according to federal court documents. One of the people Hunter coordinated with posted publicly to social media: “Lock and load boys. Boog flags are in the air, and the national network is going off,” the complaint states.

Two hours after the police precinct was set on fire, Hunter texted with another Boogaloo member in California, a man named Steven Carrillo.

“Go for police buildings,” Hunter told Carrillo, according to charging documents.

Benjamin Ryan Teeter, left, a North Carolina resident charged with conspiracy to provide aid to a foreign terrorist organization, is pictured with Ivan Harrison Hunter, a Texas resident who was charged Oct. 19 in a federal criminal complaint with interstate travel to incidte a riot. The complaint alleges that he fired several shots into the Minneapolis Police Third Precinct building. This photo was included with the sworn affidavit, filed by the FBI, that serves as the basis for the complaint.

“I did better lol,” Carrillo replied. A few hours earlier, Carrillo had killed a Federal Protective Services officer in Oakland, Calif., according to criminal charges filed against him in California.

On June 1, Hunter asked Carrillo for money, explaining he needed to “be in the woods for a bit,” and Carrillo sent him $200 via a cash app.

Five days later, Carrillo shot and killed a sheriff’s deputy in Santa Cruz when authorities tried to arrest him, according to charges filed in California. Authorities say he then stole a car and wrote “Boog” on the hood “in what appeared to be his own blood.”

A couple of days later, during police protests in Austin, Texas, police pulled over a truck after seeing three men in tactical gear and carrying guns drive away in it. Hunter, in the front passenger seat, wore six loaded banana magazines for an AK-47-style assault rifle on his tactical vest, according federal authorities. The two other men had AR-15 magazines affixed to their vests. The officers found an AK-47-style rifle and two AR-15 rifles on the rear seat of the vehicle, a pistol next to the driver’s seat and another pistol in the center console.

Hunter denied he owned any of the weapons found in the vehicle. He did, according to the complaint, volunteer that he was the leader of the Boogaloo Bois in South Texas and that he was present in Minneapolis when the Third Precinct was set on fire. Police seized the guns and let Hunter and the others go.

Hunter had bragged about his role in the Minneapolis riots on Facebook, publicly proclaiming, “I helped the community burn down that police station” and “I didn’t’ [sic] protest peacefully Dude … Want something to change? Start risking felonies for what is good.”

“The BLM protesters in Minneapolis loved me [sic] fireteam and I,” he wrote on June 11. According to the complaint, “fire team” is a reference to a group he started with Carrillo “that responds with violence if the police try to take their guns away.”

“Hunter also referred to himself as a ‘terrorist,’ ” the complaint states.

A confidential informant told police that Hunter planned to “go down shooting” if authorities closed in. He didn’t. They arrested him without incident in San Antonio, Texas, this week, and he made his first court appearance Thursday.

Hunter is the third member of the Boogaloo Bois, a loose-knit group intent on igniting a second American civil war, to be charged in Minneapolis as a result of the unrest that followed Floyd’s death.

Michael Robert Solomon and Benjamin Ryan Teeter were indicted in September with conspiracy to provide material support to Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization."
McConnell says 'no concerns' despite visible bandages and bruises,292,jgmaqj,https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/politics/mitch-mcconnell-bruised-hands/index.html,123,1603485470.0,,"(CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not answer questions about his health Thursday, only saying there were ""no concerns"" after reporters asked him about what appeared to be bruises and bandages on his hands in recent days.

""Of course not,"" McConnell told reporters in the Capitol when asked if he had any health issues people should know about.

McConnell, who is up for reelection, later said there were ""no concerns"" when asked directly by CNN about the apparent bruises or if he had any other problems.

The 78-year-old did not respond when asked if he was being treated by a doctor. An aide to McConnell also declined to provide any additional details when asked multiple times about the majority leader's health.

The hands of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are seen as he talks to the media after the Republican policy luncheon on Capitol Hill on October 20, 2020.

McConnell has been conducting his regular business in the Senate this week, including delivering speeches on the Senate floor as he usually does when the chamber is in session. On Thursday, McConnell spoke in favor of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court in his remarks on the floor.

The president posted the nearly 40-minute sit-down to his Facebook page with the caption: ""Look at the bias, hatred and rudeness on behalf of 60 Minutes and CBS.""

""Tonight’s anchor, Kristen Welker, is far worse!"" Trump added, referencing the NBC News anchor who will moderate the presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn.

Trump abruptly ended the interview with Stahl before a scheduled walk-and-talk with the president and Vice President Pence.

During the interview, he bemoans that Stahl opened the interview by asking if he was ready for ""tough questions,"" calling it ""no way to talk.""

Trump corrects himself to say ""the interview"" with Biden.

""I think we’re ready for the vice president now,"" a production assistant says off camera.

""OK, that’s enough. Let’s go,"" Trump says.

CBS News said earlier this week that the White House agreed that they would tape the interview “for archival purposes only.”

“The White House’s unprecedented decision to disregard their agreement with CBS News and release their footage will not deter 60 MINUTES from providing its full, fair and contextual reporting which presidents have participated in for decades,” CBS News said in a statement after Trump posted the interview.

“60 MINUTES, the most-watched news program on television, is widely respected for bringing its hallmark fairness, deep reporting and informative context to viewers each week. Few journalists have the presidential interview experience Lesley Stahl has delivered over her decades as one of the premier correspondents in America and we look forward to audiences seeing her third interview with President Trump and subsequent interview with Vice President Pence this weekend,” the statement read.

The interview will air Sunday alongside another with Biden, who was interviewed by correspondent Norah O’Donnell earlier this week.

The interview is combative throughout, with Stahl often interjecting to point out basic facts and question Trump on some of his claims and rhetoric.

“We can’t put on things we can’t verify,” Stahl tells the president after he repeats his unproven claim that the Obama administration spied on his campaign.

Trump at multiple points claims that Stahl has “discredited herself” by not covering allegations in the New York Post about Hunter Biden’s business dealings after Stahl said “60 Minutes” could not verify them.

Stahl repeatedly tells Trump that his allegations that Hunter Biden influenced his father have been discredited by Republican-led Senate committees, and she pushes him on his insistence that his administration has a health care plan ready to release despite its refusal to release any details on such a plan.

At the beginning of the interview, Stahl focuses on the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus and the rising cases in the United States, asking him to acknowledge the increase.

“I think we have done a great job with COVID,” Trump says.

“Sir, excuse me. Cases are up in about 40 states,” Stahl replies.

Trump acknowledges the increase in cases but attributes them only to an increase in testing, a claim that public health experts have said is misleading.

“Because we do so much testing, the fake news media loves to say, cases are up. The fact is we have done a very good job,” Trump says.

The president also continued to insist that the U.S. is turning the corner on the virus, a claim that is out of step with his top health officials’ warnings about the risk of a resurgence.

“We have turned the corner. We understand the disease. We understand the elderly and we are taking care of them,” Trump says.

At one point, Trump grows agitated with Stahl’s characterization of his recent plea to suburban women to “please like me” at a campaign rally. Trump insists angrily that he made the remark in jest.

“You said the other day to suburban women, 'Will you please like me?'” Stahl says in a pleading voice.

“Oh I didn’t say that. You know, that is so misleading the way you said it. I say jokingly, suburban women you should love me because I’m giving you security and I got rid of the worst regulation,” Trump says.

“See, the way you said that is why people think of you and everyone else as fake news,"" Trump continues. “I said that in a joking way. The way you have it is like I’m begging.”

Two armed men showed up outside a polling station in Florida on Tuesday and claimed to be a part of the Trump campaign, though the campaign denied any connection with them.

Julie Marcus, the supervisor for elections for Florida's Pinellas County, told local outlet WFLA 8 that the men said they had been hired by the campaign.

Marcus said they were dressed in security uniforms, and set up a tent near an early voting site on 1st Avenue North, St Petersburg.

Thea McDonald, Deputy National Press Secretary for the Trump campaign, told WFLA 8 that the men were not part of Trump's campaign and that they had not got any instructions from them.

ABC Action News reported that the men left due to the rain, but said that they would return on Thursday.

Fox 13 Tampa Bay reported that sheriff's deputies will be stationed at all of the country's early voting sites from Thursday until November 2, the last day of early voting.

ABC Action News also reported that the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office is investigating a report of possible voter intimidation over the incident.

Fox 13 noted that bringing a gun to a polling place is a third-degree felony and that political campaigners have to stay 150 feet away from the entrance.

It reported that the sheriff said the men's presence there did not violate the law because they did not bring firearms into the building.

19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Here's what their stories have in common.,348,jfjnvg,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/10/21/trump-sexual-assault-allegations-share-similar-patterns-19-women/5279155002/,49,1603336920.0,,"Today, writer E. Jean Carroll goes to court in a unique case: she accused the sitting president of defamation. But when she came forward in 2019 to say Trump had raped her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s, her story started with a familiar detail.

""The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips,"" she wrote in June 2019.

Former model Amy Dorris, the latest to come forward just last month to allege that Trump had sexually assaulted her in 1997 at the US Open tennis tournament, said it began in a similar way.

“He just grabbed me. And he just shoved his tongue down my throat,” Dorris told the Guardian. “His grip was hard, you know, you couldn’t pull away.”

Trump campaign legal adviser Jenna Ellis said Dorris' claim was ""totally false"" and an attempt to attack Trump before the election.

Thirteen of the 19 women who have accused Trump of sexual assault or non-consensual physical contact said he kissed them without consent, often out of the blue, sometimes holding them firmly in place.

Another reason the scene is familiar: It’s how Trump himself described his approach to women in a 2005 recording of what he thought was a private conversation, released in 2016.

“You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them,” he said in the now-infamous Access Hollywood recording. “It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.”

Carroll brought a defamation case against Trump after he allegedly slandered her in denying her claims. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice attempted to intervene in the case by putting the federal government, rather than Trump himself, in the position of defendant.

Today, oral arguments begin between Carroll's attorneys and the Justice Department to consider whether the DOJ can move forward.

In their own words, here is how Carroll and other women describe their encounters with Trump:

What can be learned from patterns

A USA TODAY review of 19 women's allegations — the number who allege non-consensual physical contact — as well as more than 4,000 words that Trump has spoken, tweeted or released in written statements since 2016 addressing their allegations, show patterns in both the allegations and Trump's reactions to them.

Patterns in the behavior of alleged sexual abusers may be used by prosecutors to try to lay out a modus operandi, or ""something about the way a defendant operates that is akin to a signature,"" said Deborah Tuerkheimer, professor at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law and a former assistant district attorney in New York, speaking generally.

""How do you show that a person has, let's just say, a sense of entitlement that leads him to just take what he thinks he deserves? Is that something that can be reflected in multiple instances of misconduct?"" she said. ""Some sexual predators who engage in patterned behavior have certain things that they say repeatedly or often. Sometimes they do the same kinds of things, so there's a particular interest in a body part or a preoccupation with doing something in a certain way.""

Election 2020: Accusations against both Trump and Biden leave survivors disappointed

In the case of Trump, the Access Hollywood tape is unique in that it is ""a shining example of the kind of words that could be used to help explain what's going on in someone's head,"" Tuerkheimer said.

""It is really uncommon ... to have the man accused provide a window into his thinking, where you actually get a statement that reflects a particular view of, be it women or be it an entitlement to women's bodies,"" she said.

However, Trump is not on trial for sexual assault, as Carroll's case is for defamation.

Key elements of Trump accusers' stories reveal similarities

Carroll is the only one of the 19 women to accuse Trump of rape, although his first wife, Ivana Trump, accused him of marital rape in a 1990 deposition. Trump denied it and she later said she did not mean it in a criminal sense. Jill Harth, a makeup artist who, along with a male associate, had a business relationship with Trump, accused Trump of attempted rape in a 1997 lawsuit which she withdrew from court, though she said in 2016 she stood by her claims.

From 2005 to early 2007, there were seven incidents when women alleged Trump sexually attacked or forcibly touched them. That’s at the very start of his marriage to model Melania Trump, and it’s in the early – and peak ratings years – of Trump’s hit television show, ""The Apprentice.""

It’s also in the immediate wake of when the Access Hollywood tape was recorded.

Two of the allegations took place in July 2006 — the same month Trump had his affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels, who received a $130,000 payment just before the 2016 election by the president’s former lawyer and signed a nondisclosure agreement about the affair. It is now part of a larger investigation into Trump's finances.

That same weekend, Jessica Drake said, Trump kissed her without permission and offered to pay her for sex. Ninni Laaksonen, the former Miss Finland, said that he grabbed her butt that same month before an appearance on the David Letterman show.

Though our analysis focused on 19 women who alleged physical contact, more women have alleged other inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature from Trump, including a number of participants in pageants he owned like former Miss North Carolina Samantha Holvey, who said he made her feel ""like a piece of meat."" And former Miss Teen Vermont Mariah Billado and former Miss Arizona Tasha Dixon who both say Trump entered dressing rooms unannounced while young women were topless or naked.

Trump's own comments about ""inspecting"" Miss USA contestants and claims he would touch them, Tuerkheimer said, are an example of entitlement that ""can lead to an inference that a person is more willing to just touch, just grab, just grope, just kiss.""

Ten women say it happened at Trump’s properties

More than half of the cases are alleged to have happened at Trump’s properties in New York and Florida, places where he had access to private spaces or more control over the environment.

Like Dorris, Karen Johnson said Trump caught her outside the restroom. However, Johnson was at a Mar-a-Lago party when Trump allegedly groped her, pulled her behind a tapestry and kissed her, she told journalists Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy in their book ""All the President's Women.""

Cathy Heller said Trump grabbed and kissed her when she attended a Mother’s Day Brunch at Mar-a-Lago in 1997.

In Harth's lawsuit she alleged one of the incidents of groping took place in Trump's daughter Ivanka's bedroom at Mar-a-Lago.

Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter for People magazine, published a story in the magazine alleging that Trump pushed her against the wall and forced his tongue into her mouth while giving her a tour of Mar-a-Lago in December 2005. She was visiting to interview Trump for an article.

In a 2016 Palm Beach Post article, Mindy McGillivray said she was groped by Trump during an event at Mar-a-Lago in 2003.

Most of the women were in their 20s

Ten of the 19 women were in their twenties when they say the incidents occurred. In many cases, they were decades younger than Trump.

Dorris was 24 and Trump 51 at the time the alleged assault took place.

Kristin Anderson, an aspiring model who said Trump groped her in the early 1990s, was in her early 20s at the time; Trump would have been in his mid- to late-40s. Then-Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks denied the incident with Anderson occurred and called it a ""political attack designed to tear down Mr. Trump"" in 2016.

10 women allege the incidents happened in business settings

Ten women say Trump kissed or groped them while they were meeting for a job interview or as part of a business deal.

Former ""Apprentice"" contestant Jennifer Murphy, who said she plans to vote for Trump, told Grazia magazine he unexpectedly kissed her on the lips while she was leaving a job interview in 2005.

Summer Zervos, another former contestant on ""The Apprentice,"" said her incident with Trump also happened as part of a job interview, which Trump had scheduled in his private hotel room.

Rachel Crooks was a receptionist at Bayrock Group, a Trump Tower client, in 2005 when she introduced herself to Trump outside an elevator where, she alleges, he kissed her on the mouth. Trump called it ""Another False Accusation"" in a 2018 tweet.

Juliet Huddy, a former Fox News host, said Trump kissed her after a lunch.

Trump’s denials contain false info

On at least four occasions, Trump has falsely stated he'd never met women who accused him of sexual assault, despite video or photo evidence to the contrary. There is photographic or video evidence of him interacting with at least 11 of the accusers.

“I have no idea who these women are, have no idea,” he said at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Oct. 14, 2016. “Never met this person, these people, I don’t know who they are,” he added later in the rally. We found that Trump had been photographed or appeared on national television interacting with Dorris, Murphy, Stoynoff, Zervos, Searles, McDowell, Laaksonen, Drake and Harth.

“I’ve never met this person in my life,” Trump said in a written statement responding to Carroll’s rape allegation, even though New York magazine had already published a photograph of Carroll and Trump together at a social event in 1987.

At least seven times, Trump has claimed, without evidence, that allegations against him have been discredited.

On Oct. 14, 2016 Trump said ""eyewitnesses already debunked to a People Magazine story.” But there is no evidence eyewitnesses to the alleged assault debunked Stoynoff’s story. Stoynoff said Trump’s butler walked in, but he has never spoken publicly and would have been the sole eyewitness.

Two days later, Trump said ""those stories have been largely debunked” and on Oct. 17 he tweeted twice, saying ""these totally phoney stories, 100% made up by women (many already proven false)"" and ""media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with made-up stories and lies, and got caught.” There is no evidence any allegation of sexual assault against Trump at this point had been “largely debunked” or ""proven false.""

On Sept. 27, 2018, Trump said: “I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television.""

But there is no evidence any women were paid ""to make up stories” or were “caught” making up allegations.

What about Biden?

Democratic nominee former Vice President Joe Biden has also faced allegations of improper conduct with women. The majority of claims against him include unwanted touching or inappropriate displays of physical affection.

Eight women spoke up in 2019 to say they were on the receiving end of uncomfortable touching, such as Lucy Flores’ claim that Biden smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head. The claims forced Biden to publicly acknowledge that times have changed and say he would be “more mindful” going forward.

However, one of the women, Tara Reade, claims that Biden also sexually assaulted her. She says it took place in 1993 while she worked for his Senate office, a claim the former vice president denies.

Asked about Reade’s claim against Biden shortly after she came forward with it this year, voters were split on whether they believed her. Half of Republicans and only 20% of Democrats said it was probably true.

Public perception

Just as numerous similar stories suggest the public should pay attention, the absence of a group of survivors sharing like accounts about a person in power does not mean that an individual is not credible, said Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center.

“It is important not to react to the Harvey Weinsteins and Charlie Roses, where so many women came forward, with the conclusion that if someone is making an allegation on her own… that that is false,” Martin said. “That simply isn’t the case in law or real life.”

Though Martin did not comment on the particular allegations against Trump or Biden, she said that it’s important to take any allegation seriously while still asking questions to get to the truth.

As the Me Too movement has gained traction since 2017, “it’s made a tremendous amount of difference for public perception when multiple women come forward telling similar stories,” Martin said.

Martin said when looking at incidents of alleged sexual harassment or abuse, when there are similarities in the accounts coming from multiple alleged victims about the same perpetrator, “it’s certainly hard to dismiss.”

In the case of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, for example, Martin noted the many common threads in survivors’ accounts spanning decades, even when the women came forward many years after they were abused.

“Coming forward has a lot of cost, and so the willingness of multiple women to go on the record to share their story and to expose themselves both to the embarrassment of having to share these traumatic incidents and to the backlash and the attacks that you see when survivors of sexual violence come forward with allegations against powerful people… it seems more and more unlikely that anyone would do that for any other reason than telling the truth,” Martin said, though she was not referring to Trump's accusers specifically.

However, 13 of the 19 women accusing Trump went public with their stories prior to the 2016 election and Trump still won the votes of about 42% of women.

Currently, women favor Biden by a 53%-40% margin, according to Investor's Business Daily/TIPP poll out Monday.

As the 2020 presidential election draws near, the question remains: Do voters believe these allegations — and do they care?

President Donald Trump told a crowd at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday that he came to see them only because his campaign was doing worse than he hoped.

Trump spoke for an hour at Erie International Airport, seeking to tout his accomplishments and attack Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee.

Trump has held several rallies across the US in recent weeks and is scheduled to debate Biden on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee. The US election is on November 3, in 13 days.

But on Tuesday, Trump suggested that the only reason he visited Erie was that the coronavirus pandemic had hampered his campaign so much.

""Four or five months ago when we started this whole thing — because, you know, before the plague came in, I had it made. I wasn't coming to Erie,"" Trump said. ""I mean, I have to be honest, there's no way I was coming.""

""I didn't have to. I would've called you and said, 'Hey, Erie. You know, if you have a chance, get out and vote.' We had this thing won. We were so far up.

""We had the greatest economy ever, greatest jobs, greatest everything. And then we got hit with the plague, and I had to go back to work. 'Hello, Erie, may I please have your vote?' Right?""

National polls have found Biden with about a 10-point lead over Trump. Of the 10 swing states aggregated in CNN's Poll of Polls, Pennsylvania was the state in which Biden had the largest lead: Polling there in late September and early October found Biden with an average of 52% support, compared with 43% for Trump.

ROME (AP) — Pope Francis became the first pontiff to endorse same-sex civil unions in comments for a documentary that premiered Wednesday, sparking cheers from gay Catholics and demands for clarification from conservatives, given the Vatican’s official teaching on the issue.

The papal thumbs-up came midway through the feature-length documentary “Francesco,” which premiered at the Rome Film Festival. The film, which features fresh interviews with the pope, delves into issues Francis cares about most, including the environment, poverty, migration, racial and income inequality, and the people most affected by discrimination.

“Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God,” Francis said. “You can’t kick someone out of a family, nor make their life miserable for this. What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.”

While serving as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis endorsed civil unions for gay couples as an alternative to same-sex marriages. However, he had never come out publicly in favor of civil unions as pope, and no pontiff before him had, either.

The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit who has sought to build bridges with gay Catholics, praised the comments as “a major step forward in the church’s support for LGBT people.”

“The pope’s speaking positively about civil unions also sends a strong message to places where the church has opposed such laws,” Martin said in a statement.

However, conservative Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, called for clarification. “The pope’s statement clearly contradicts what has been the long-standing teaching of the church about same-sex unions,” he said in a statement. “The church cannot support the acceptance of objectively immoral relationships.”

And Ed Mechmann, director of public policy at the Archdiocese of New York, said in a blog post that the pope had simply “made a serious mistake.”

Catholic teaching holds that gay people must be treated with dignity and respect but that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered.” A 2003 document from the Vatican’s doctrine office stated the church’s respect for gay people “cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions.”

Doing so, the Vatican reasoned, would not only condone “deviant behavior,” but create an equivalence to marriage, which the church holds is an indissoluble union between man and woman.

That document was signed by the then-prefect of the office, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI and Francis’ predecessor.

Later Wednesday, questions arose about when Francis first made the remarks. The scene of his interview is identical to one from 2019 with Mexican broadcaster Televisa, but his comments about the need for legal protections for civil unions apparently never aired until the documentary.

Director Evgeny Afineevsky, who is gay, expressed surprise after the premiere that the pope’s comments had created such a firestorm, saying Francis wasn’t trying to change doctrine but was merely expressing his belief gay people should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals. He insisted the pope made the comments to him directly, through a translator, but declined to say when.

“The world needs positivity right now, the world needs to care about climate change, care about refugees and migration, borders, walls, family separation,” Afineevsky said, urging attention to the main issues covered by the film.

One main character in the documentary is Juan Carlos Cruz, the Chilean survivor of clergy sexual abuse whom Francis initially discredited during a 2018 visit to Chile.

Cruz, who is gay, said that during his first meetings with the pope in May 2018 after they patched things up, Francis assured him that God made Cruz gay. Cruz tells his own story throughout the film, chronicling both Francis’ evolution on understanding sexual abuse as well as to document the pope’s views on gay people.

Afineevsky had remarkable access to cardinals, the Vatican television archives and the pope himself. He said he negotiated his way in through persistence, and deliveries of Argentine mate tea and Alfajores cookies that he got to the pope via well-connected Argentines in Rome.

“Listen, when you are in the Vatican, the only way to achieve something is to break the rule and then to say, ‘I’m sorry,’” Afineevsky said in an interview.

The director worked official and unofficial channels starting in 2018, and ended up so close to Francis by the end of the project that he showed him the movie on his iPad in August. The two recently exchanged Yom Kippur greetings; Afineevsky is a Russian-born, Israeli-raised Jew now based in Los Angeles. On Wednesday, Afineevsky’s 48th birthday, the director said Francis presented him with a birthday cake at the Vatican.

But “Francesco” is more than a biopic about the pope. Wim Wenders did that in the 2018 film “Pope Francis: A Man of His Word.”

“Francesco,” is more a visual survey of the world’s crises and tragedies, with audio from the pope providing possible solutions.

Afineevsky, who was nominated for an Oscar for his 2015 documentary “Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom,” traveled the world to document the film: at Cox’s Bazaar in Bangladesh, where Myanmar’s Rohingya sought refuge; the U.S.-Mexico border; and Francis’ native Argentina.

“The film tells the story of the pope by reversing the cameras,” said Vatican communications director Paolo Ruffini, one of Afineevsky’s closest Vatican-based collaborators.

Full Coverage: Religion

Ruffini said that when Afineevsky approached him about a documentary, he tried to tamp down his hopes for interviewing the pope. “I told him it wasn’t going to be easy,” he said.

But Ruffini suggested Afineevsky find the people who had been impacted by the pope, even after just a brief meeting: refugees, prisoners and gay people to whom he has ministered.

“I told him that many of those encounters had certainly been filmed by the Vatican cameras, and that there he would find a veritable gold mine of stories that told a story,” Ruffini said. “He would be able to tell story of the pope through the eyes of all and not just his own.”

Francis’ outreach dates to his first foreign trip in 2013, when he uttered the now-famous words “Who am I to judge,” when asked during an airborne news conference returning from Rio de Janiero about a purportedly gay priest.

Since then, he has ministered to gays and transsexual prostitutes, and welcomed people in gay partnerships into his inner circle. One of them was his former student, Yayo Grassi, who along with his partner visited Francis at the Vatican Embassy in Washington D.C., during a 2015 visit to the U.S.

The Vatican publicized that encounter, making video and photos of it available, after Francis was ambushed during that same visit by his then-ambassador, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who invited the Kentucky anti-gay marriage activist Kim Davis to meet with the pope.

News of the Davis audience made headlines and was viewed by conservatives as a papal stamp of approval for Davis, who was jailed for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Vatican vigorously sought to downplay it, with a spokesman saying the meeting by no means indicated Francis’ support for her or her position on gay marriage.

Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was fervently opposed to gay marriage when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires. Then, he launched what gay activists remember as a “war of God” against Argentina’s move to approve same-sex marriage.

The pope’s authorized biographer, Sergio Rubin, said at the time of his 2013 election that Bergoglio was politically wise enough to know the church couldn’t win a fight against gay marriage. Instead, Rubin said, Bergoglio urged his fellow bishops to lobby for gay civil unions.

It wasn’t until Bergoglio’s proposal was shot down by the conservative bishops’ conference that he publicly declared his opposition, and the church lost the issue altogether.

In the documentary, Francis essentially confirms Rubin’s account of what transpired. Of his belief in the need for legislation to protect gay couples in civil relationships, he said: “I stood up for that.”

Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, an organization of LGBT Catholics, praised Francis’ comments as a “historic” shift for a church that has a record of persecuting gays.

“At the same time, we urge Pope Francis to apply the same kind of reasoning to recognize and bless these same unions of love and support within the Catholic Church, too,” he said in a statement.

More conservative commentators sought to play down Francis’ words and said that while secular civil unions are one thing, a church blessing of them is quite another.

In a tweet, conservative U.S. author and commentator Ryan Anderson noted that he and some colleagues had gone on record a decade ago saying they would support federal civil unions for any two adults who commit to sharing domestic responsibilities. Such an arrangement, Anderson said, would leave churches the option of refusing to recognize these unions as marriage."
How Rudy Giuliani Got Caught Red-Handed With Borat’s Daughter,107,jfh5zm,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-rudy-giuliani-got-caught-red-handed-with-borats-daughter?source=politics&via=rss,15,1603329446.0,,"Sacha Baron Cohen has pulled a lot of outrageous pranks over the past couple of decades. None have been quite as insane as the one that ends with Rudy Giuliani’s hands in his pants.

When the trailer for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm dropped online earlier this month, it stood to reason that the climax of the highly anticipated sequel would involve Baron Cohen’s iconic Kazakh character attempting to deliver his daughter as a gift to Vice President Mike Pence at CPAC while dressed in an elaborate Donald Trump costume.

In fact, that scene, which got picked up by conservative media outlets all the way back in February—with no one the wiser that Baron Cohen was behind the prank—comes and goes within the first third of the new movie, out on Amazon Prime Video this Friday.

But while Pence emerges from the film more or less unscathed, another close confidant of the president’s does not.

The following details come with a major spoiler alert for anyone who doesn’t want to know what happens. At first it seemed as though Giuliani himself may have spoiled the ending this past July when he revealed to his favorite newspaper the New York Post that he had called the NYPD on Baron Cohen after the prankster comedian burst into an interview he was doing wearing what he described as a “pink transgender outfit.”

Speaking to WABC radio that same month, Giuliani admitted that Baron Cohen was trying to capture him in a “compromising” situation. But when he was asked if he did anything that he might be “regretful” about, he replied, “I don’t think so, I’m trying to remember.”

In Giuliani’s telling, he was answering questions on camera from a female reporter when they were abruptly interrupted. “This person comes in yelling and screaming, and I thought this must be a scam or a shakedown, so I reported it to the police. He then ran away,” the former New York City mayor and current personal lawyer for President Trump said. “I only later realized it must have been Sacha Baron Cohen. I thought about all the people he previously fooled and I felt good about myself because he didn’t get me.”

After watching the film, it becomes abundantly clear that Baron Cohen most certainly did “get” Giuliani.

The larger premise of the consistently funny sequel, nimbly directed by Jason Woliner, is that Borat Sagdiyev must redeem himself in the eyes of his country’s premier after bringing shame on Kazakhstan with the original film. Ultimately a plan is reached to wed his teenage daughter Tutar—played brilliantly by the mostly unknown and somewhat mysterious Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova—to someone in President Trump’s inner circle.

With Pence off the table—and, as they joke, most of Trump’s other close associates in prison—they set their sights on Giuliani. “Rudolph was Donald’s best buddy in whole world,” Borat says in his voiceover. “And also very dignified statesman of the highest order. This would not be easy.”

“Luckily I discover his preference for womens with ample cheese-producing capacity,” he adds, referring to yet another Page Six article that claimed Giuliani had “been bragging to pals about having an affair with a married woman with ‘big boobs.’”

After an extended bit in which Borat tries to force Tutar to get breast implants—and a long and deeply revealing detour surrounding the COVID-19 lockdown that includes the previously-leaked prank Baron Cohen pulled on a far-right militia rally in Washington state—the film arrives at the fateful interview with Giuliani.

Posing as a conservative journalist in the mold of Tomi Lahren—albeit with a strong eastern European accent—Tutar sits down with Giuliani in a Manhattan hotel suite for an “interview” in which she mostly flatters him into creepily flirting with her. “I’ll relax you, you want me to ask you a question?” Giuliani says as she giggles in response. After blaming China for the coronavirus, he agrees to “eat a bat” with his interviewer, who repeatedly touches his knee to egg him on.

Baron Cohen first interrupts the interview dressed as a sound engineer with a large boom mic, but leaves before it’s over. At that point, Tutar offers to “have a drink in the bedroom” with Giuliani, who happily obliges.

“ Giuliani then lies down on the bed and starts sticking his hands down his pants in a seemingly suggestive manner. ”

On what appear to be hidden cameras, we see Giuliani remove her microphone and ask for her phone number and address as he sits down on the bed. He starts patting her backside as she removes the microphone from his pants. Giuliani then lies down on the bed and starts sticking his hands down his pants in a seemingly suggestive manner.

But before anything more can happen, Borat bursts into the room and shouts, “Put down your chram!”—his preferred word for penis. “She’s 15! She’s too old for you!”

The startled Giuliani, who had no reason to believe his interviewer was underage, sits up abruptly and gets out of there as fast as he can. “Rudy, Trump will be disappoint! You are leaving hotel without golden shower!” Borat yells after him.

After that, the film concludes with one more big and hilarious reveal that we won’t be spoiling here.

The Daily Beast reached out to Giuliani to clarify what exactly he thought was happening in that hotel room, and how far things might have gone before Baron Cohen interrupted them. By Wednesday afternoon, neither Giuliani nor his own attorney, Robert Costello, had responded to calls, messages, or emails seeking comment.

Details of the scene publicly emerged just as the pugnacious Trump lawyer has been waging, in the closing weeks of the 2020 race, his latest campaign against the president’s Democratic opponent Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Giuliani, with President Trump’s prior approval and encouragement, has devoted his time as a prominent Trump ally and confidant to publicizing the contents of what he says is a hard drive full of Hunter’s files and private messages.

Along with focusing on Hunter’s foreign business dealings, the Trump attorney has also lambasted Biden and his son over the lurid alleged details of Hunter’s personal excesses, addiction, and struggles. Giuliani has done this much to the frustration of certain other Trump advisers who feel that focusing too much on Hunter’s private life risks making him and his father seem more sympathetic.

In an interview with The Daily Beast published on Saturday, Giuliani said that prior to the publication of the New York Post’s initial story on the Hunter-related files, he told President Trump “that there were… a number of photographs that show very explicit sexual activity, and other very personal things.”

The president’s personal lawyer said that he did not show Trump the photos or images, because he did not want Trump to talk about that content in any great detail. Giuliani added that he had specifically advised his client that if any of that salacious material were to be published, the president should just say that “he will have to have it reviewed to see if it’s a danger to national security… because this is precisely the thing that [Trump’s foes] said they had on him… [with the urinating] prostitutes on the bed.”

In less than a week after that interview, another news story would emerge that involved a bed, supposedly explicit content, and “very personal things.” It’s just that Hunter Biden wasn’t at the center of it.

"Donald Trump leaves contentious '60 Minute' interview with Lesley Stahl, goes on Twitter attack",38,jf5tam,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/20/lesley-stahl-donald-trump-leaves-contentious-60-minutes-interview/5998366002/,7,1603281809.0,,"CLOSE President Trump cut short an interview with '60 Minutes' correspondent Lesley Stahl and has since leaked the session before its Oct. 25 airing. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump cut short a contentious interview with ""60 Minutes"" on Tuesday, and threatened to protest by posting a tape of the session before the program's scheduled broadcast on Sunday.

""This will be done so that everybody can get a glimpse of what a FAKE and BIASED interview is all about,"" Trump said in a series of tweets that also attacked ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl.

Trump, who has often criticized coverage of ""60 Minutes,"" did not provide any examples of bias.

Trump abruptly ended the session – he didn't do the traditional ""walk-and-talk"" with Stahl, and said the ""60 Minutes"" crew had been given enough time – nor did he return for a joint interview with Vice President Mike Pence, said two people familiar with the incident.

I am pleased to inform you that, for the sake of accuracy in reporting, I am considering posting my interview with Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes, PRIOR TO AIRTIME! This will be done so that everybody can get a glimpse of what a FAKE and BIASED interview is all about... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2020

CBS News reported that Trump ""cut short"" an interview with ""60 Minutes"" that is part of ""Sunday’s special edition of the broadcast featuring both"" the president and challenger Joe Biden.

As for Trump's threatened release of a tape, the network said that ""the White House had agreed they were taping the interview for archival purposes only.""

After the interview, the president also sent out an attack tweet about Stahl, posting a six-second video of her not wearing a mask at the White House just a few weeks after COVID-19 raced through the building.

Even though he avoids masks himself, Trump tweeted that ""Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me.""

Stahl did wear a mask at the White House in and around her talks with Trump and Pence, said a person familiar with the interviews, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a private matter.

The brief video Trump tweeted out was taken right after his interview, the person said. Stahl is speaking with members of her crew, all of whom tested negative for COVID-19.

""Lesley had a mask on leading into the interviews as appropriate,"" the person said.

Trump brought up the incident during a rally Tuesday night in Erie, Pa., telling supporters: ""You have to watch what we do to '60 Minutes ... You're gonna get a kick out of it. Lesley Stahl's not gonna be happy.""

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany also tweeted about Stahl, posting a picture of the CBS correspondent holding a book listing the administration's health care policies.

""She couldn’t believe how HUGE it was and said, “I can hardly lift this,"" McEnany said of Stahl.

The Trump interview is scheduled to be part of a ""60 Minutes"" program on the election to air Sunday.

The CBS program will broadcast taped interviews with all four national candidates: Trump and Pence, as well as Biden and running mate Kamala Harris.

Lawyers say they can't find the parents of 545 migrant children separated by Trump administration,391,jf19ra,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/lawyers-say-they-can-t-find-parents-545-migrant-children-n1244066,79,1603265170.0,,"WASHINGTON — Lawyers appointed by a federal judge to identify migrant families who were separated by the Trump administration say that they have yet to track down the parents of 545 children and that about two-thirds of those parents were deported to Central America without their children, according to a filing Tuesday from the American Civil Liberties Union.

The Trump administration instituted a ""zero tolerance"" policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern U.S. border. The administration later confirmed that it had actually begun separating families in 2017 along some parts of the border under a pilot program. The ACLU and other pro-bono law firms were tasked with finding the members of families separated during the pilot program.

Unlike the 2,800 families separated under zero tolerance in 2018, most of whom remained in custody when the policy was ended by executive order, many of the more than 1,000 parents separated from their children under the pilot program had already been deported before a federal judge in California ordered that they be found.

""It is critical to find out as much as possible about who was responsible for this horrific practice while not losing sight of the fact that hundreds of families have still not been found and remain separated,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project. ""There is so much more work to be done to find these families.

""People ask when we will find all of these families, and sadly, I can't give an answer. I just don't know,"" Gelernt said. ""But we will not stop looking until we have found every one of the families, no matter how long it takes. The tragic reality is that hundreds of parents were deported to Central America without their children, who remain here with foster families or distant relatives.""

The ACLU and other organizations that are part of a court-appointed ""steering committee"" learned that more than 1,000 families were separated in 2017 based on data provided by the Department of Homeland Security. Of those, the committee has been able to contact the parents of more than 550 children and believes about 25 of them may have a chance to come back to the U.S. for reunification.

Gelernt said some of the families that have been contacted have elected to keep their children in the U.S. with family members or sponsors ""due to fear of what will happen to their child if they return"" to their home countries.

The group Justice in Motion is physically searching for the separated parents in Mexico and Central America. ""While we have already located many deported parents, there are hundreds more who we are still trying to reach,"" the group said in a statement. ""It's an arduous and time-consuming process on a good day. During the pandemic, our team of human rights defenders is taking special measures to protect their own security and safety, as well as that of the parents and their communities.""

A separate court order directed that the Trump administration reunite families separated under zero tolerance in 2018.

In a statement, the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency responsible for providing care to the migrant children, said, ""All of the 545 minors referenced were appropriately discharged from [the Office of Refugee Resettlement's] unaccompanied alien children program prior to June 23, 2018. [HHS] has already provided relevant information requested by the court.""

Via Twitter, a DHS spokesperson said, “This narrative has been dispelled. In the current litigation, for example, out of the parents of 485 children whom Plaintiffs’ counsel has been able to contact, they've yet to identify a single family that wants their child reunited with them in their country of origin.”

Asked about the report, White House spokesperson Brian Morgenstern said, that many of the parents “have declined to accept their children back...It's not for lack of effort on the administration’s part.""

Responding to the administration’s statements, the ACLU’s Gelernt said, “First, we have not even found these 545 parents so neither we nor certainly the administration can know whether they want to be reunited.”

“Second, in the past there have certainly have been parents who have made the agonizing decision to leave the child in the U.S. because of the danger the child would face upon return. The humane and simple solution is for the Trump administration to allow the parents to return to the U.S. to reunite with their children but the administration is not allowing that.“"

Republicans eke out Democrats in turnout on first day of Florida's early voting,17,jetxsq,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/521874-republicans-eke-out-democrats-in-turnout-on-first-day-of-florida-early,3,1603242850.0,,"More registered Republicans than Democrats turned out to vote on the first day of early voting in Florida, according to data reviewed by The Washington Post.

The difference wasn't huge, with 43 percent of those showing up to vote being registered Republicans compared to 42 percent who were registered Democrats. The remaining voters in the group of 339,152 people who cast in-person votes on Monday were registered with a third party or were unaffiliated.

Turnout on the first day of early voting in the critical swing state was up nearly 17 percent compared to four years ago when roughly 290,000 cast ballots, the Florida Department of State reported.

Vote-by-mail has seen a massive uptick in popularity this year, with more than 2.5 million ballots collected on the first day of early voting. There are more than 14 million registered voters in the state in total.

An Axios survey released last month showed 75 percent of respondents who strongly disapprove of the president's job performance are likely to vote early by mail.

The risks associated with the coronavirus pandemic have swayed many voters to submit their ballots remotely or via designated drop boxes, as over 22 million votes have already been cast this year across the nation.

Last week, Florida's Division of Elections reported that Democrats were leading in early voting, though it noted more Republicans are largely expected to vote on or around the days leading up to Nov. 3.

Trump won Florida by fewer than 120,000 votes in 2016. The Post noted that several counties that favored the president four years ago, including Clearwater, Pinellas, St. Petersburg, Duval and Seminole, showed higher turnouts of Democratic voters Monday.

Other states in the South are setting records for absentee voting, with Alabama receiving over 3 percent more mail-in ballots cast than the previous record set during the 2012 election.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/Files

(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said there had been no phone call between its chief executive, Darren Woods, and President Donald Trump after the president invoked the company’s name at a rally in Arizona on Monday when he said he could raise more money than his Democratic rival Joe Biden.

Trump, at the rally, said he could raise large sums of money if he wanted to by calling oil and Wall Street executives. He proceeded to paint a scenario of what he could do - though Trump said he would not actually make the kind of phone call he described.

“We are aware of the President’s statement regarding a hypothetical call with our CEO…and just so we’re all clear, it never happened,” Exxon said on Twitter.

Trump told the rally: “Don’t forget, I’m not bad at that stuff anyway, and I’m president. So I call some guy, the head of Exxon. I call the head of Exxon. I don’t know.”

Trump went on to describe a hypothetical conversation: “How are you doing? How’s energy coming? When are you doing the exploration? Oh, you need a couple of permits?”

“When I call the head of Exxon I say, ‘You know, I’d love (for you) to send me $25 million for the campaign.’ ‘Absolutely sir,’” Trump added.

“I will hit a home run every single call,” Trump said. “I would raise a billion dollars in one day if I wanted to. I don’t want to do that.”

Trump, who has been trailing Biden in opinion polls, has also been trailing his Democratic rival in fundraising. Trump’s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee started the last full month before the Nov. 3 election with $251.4 million in cash, after raising $247.8 million in September. The intake was about $135 million less than what Biden raised in September."

Court Vacates Trump Administration Rule That Sought To Kick Thousands Off Food Stamps,167,jedz9s,https://www.npr.org/2020/10/19/925497374/court-vacates-trump-administration-rule-that-sought-to-kick-thousands-off-food-s,45,1603180291.0,,"Court Vacates Trump Administration Rule That Sought To Kick Thousands Off Food Stamps

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Heins/Getty Images Scott Heins/Getty Images

A federal judge has vacated the Trump administration's rule that would have forced hundreds of thousands of Americans off food stamps. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's rule change was capricious and arbitrary, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said.

The USDA rule ""radically and abruptly alters decades of regulatory practice,"" Howell said in her ruling, adding that it would have ""exponentially"" increased food insecurity for tens of thousands of Americans and imposed significant costs on states.

The rule was originally set to take effect April 1, but Howell blocked it with a preliminary injunction in March, responding to requests from 19 states, the District of Columbia, the city of New York and other plaintiffs.

The rule change would have put new requirements on able-bodied adults without children, saying they should work at least 20 hours each week if they want to keep getting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits beyond a three-month limit.

""It would also have limited states' usual ability to waive those requirements depending on economic conditions,"" as NPR's Maria Godoy reported in March.

A week after Howell's preliminary ruling, Congress suspended food benefit time limits on recipients who are classified as ""able-bodied adults without dependents"" – or ABAWDs — until after the U.S. public health emergency due to COVID-19 is over.

""The agency has been icily silent about how many ABAWDs would have been denied SNAP benefits"" if the changes had gone into effect during the pandemic as planned,"" Howell wrote in her 67-page opinion. She added, ""In the pandemic's wake, as of May 2020, SNAP rosters have grown by over 17 percent with over 6 million new enrollees.""

The judge's tossing out of the USDA rule won't have an immediate effect, but she noted that the change in food aid would have taken effect one month after the U.S. public emergency is declared to be over.

The USDA rule's administrative record runs to 187,464 pages, including a trove of regulations, guidance documents, statistics and reference materials. But Howell found that the agency failed to explain adequately its rationale for the abrupt policy shift. The judge also said that the way the agency handled its public commenting process was so flawed that it alone would have been enough to set aside the new rule.

Despite warnings that the rule change would disparately harm minorities, women and people with disabilities, the USDA ""essentially kicked this problem bucket down the proverbial road"" by citing a lack of evidence, Howell said.

""That excuse rings hollow given the many comments supported by 'empirical data,' "" the judge said."
Justice Dept. Says Trump’s Denial of Rape Accusation Was an Official Act,114,jed5cd,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/nyregion/jean-carroll-trump-rape-lawsuit.html,19,1603177507.0,,"The Justice Department said on Monday that President Trump should not be sued personally for having denied a rape allegation because he made the statement while acting in his official capacity as president.

Lawyers for the government made the argument as they defended Attorney General William P. Barr’s decision to intervene in a defamation lawsuit filed in a New York court against President Trump by E. Jean Carroll, the writer.

Ms. Carroll has said that Mr. Trump raped her in a department store two decades ago and then falsely denied the attack while in office, branding her a liar and harming her reputation.

But Justice Department lawyers say that even though the allegation concerns an incident that occurred decades before Mr. Trump became president, his denial was still an official act because he “addressed matters relating to his fitness for office as part of an official White House response to press inquiries.”"

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department announced charges Monday against Russian intelligence officers in cyberattacks that targeted a French presidential election, the Winter Olympics in South Korea and American businesses. The case implicates the same Kremlin unit that interfered in the 2016 U.S. elections, but is not related to the November vote.

The indictment accuses the six defendants, all said to be current and former officers in the Russian military intelligence agency known as the GRU, of hacks that prosecutors say were aimed at furthering the Kremlin’s geopolitical interests and in destabilizing or punishing perceived enemies. All told, the attacks caused billions of dollars in losses and disrupted a broad cross-section of life, including health care in Pennsylvania, a power grid serving hundreds of thousands of customers in Ukraine and a French election that saw the late-stage disclosure of hacked emails.

The seven-count indictment is the most recent in a series of Justice Department prosecutions of Russian hackers, often working on behalf of the government. Past cases have focused on attacks against targets like internet giant Yahoo and the 2016 presidential contest, when Russian hackers from the GRU stole Democratic emails that were released online in the weeks before the election.

The attacks in this case are “some of the most destructive, most costly, most egregious cyber attacks ever known,” said Scott Brady, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, where the 50-page indictment was filed.

“Time and again, Russia has made it clear: They will not abide by accepted norms, and instead, they intend to continue their destructive, destabilizing cyber behavior,” said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.

The indictment does not charge the defendants in connection with interference in American elections, though the officers are part of the same intelligence unit that prosecutors say interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. One of the six charged in the case announced Monday was among the Russian military intelligence officers charged with hacking in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference.

The timing of the indictment was unrelated to the upcoming election in the U.S., said Assistant Attorney General John Demers. He said that despite ongoing warnings of Russian interference in the election, Americans “should be confident that a vote cast for their candidate will be counted for that candidate.”

The hacking targets described in Monday’s case are diverse, with the indictment fleshing out details about attacks that in some instances had already received significant attention because of the havoc they had caused.

The indictment accuses the officers, for instance, of hacking into the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea after Russia was punished by the International Olympic Committee for a vast doping conspiracy. It also says the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were targeted. Those Olympics have been postponed until next year.

The Japanese government’s chief Cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato declined to comment on specifics. “We cannot overlook malicious cyberattacks that could shake the foundation of democracy,” he said.

Tokyo 2020 in a statement said “no significant impact has been observed in our operations.” It said it has been taking “countermeasures” but declined to disclose them.

Prosecutors say the hackers unleashed a devastating malicious software attack during the opening ceremony in February 2018 that deleted data from thousands of computers related to the event and left them inoperable. Russia then tried to pin blame on North Korea in what prosecutors say was a failed “false flag” attempt.

Another attack was aimed at disrupting the 2017 presidential election in France through hacks that targeted local government entities, campaigns and political parties, including the party of current President Emmanuel Macron.

The controversy known as the “Macron Leaks” involved the leak of over 20,000 emails linked to Macron’s campaign in the days before his victory. The involvement of bots raised questions about the possible involvement of Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. The leaks, which gained huge media attention in France, were shared by WikiLeaks and several alt-right activists on Twitter, Facebook and others.

Other attacks targeted international investigators looking into the suspected nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the United Kingdom, as well as the country of Georgia, where roughly 15,000 websites were defaced.

“In many cases,” the indictment says, “the Conspirators replaced website home pages with an image of a former Georgian president, who was known for his efforts to counter Russian influence in Georgia, along with the caption, ‘I’ll be back.’”

Beyond that, though, the hacks had harmful impacts on quality-of-life for everyday citizens. The attacks in Ukraine, for instance, disrupted the power supply in the middle of winter for hundreds of thousands of customers, officials say.

And the global malware attack known as NotPetya that infected computers across the world harmed the operations of the Heritage Valley Heath System, which prosecutors say serves tens of thousands of people in western Pennsylvania. Work stations were locked, hard drives encrypted, laboratory records and other files were inaccessible, and Heritage Valley temporarily lost access to critical computer systems related to medical care.

Robert Lee, a security researcher who helped uncover the malware used in one of the Ukraine hacks, said U.S. and European political leaders should have done more at the time to call out Russia and make clear that attacks on power grids are unacceptable.

But Lee, CEO of security firm Dragos, also welcomed the indictment as an important message before the U.S. presidential election about American officials’ resolve to fight back against attacks on elections and civic infrastructure.

“This is a broad signal from U.S. intelligence to say, ‘We’re watching you and we’re willing to burn our resources to burn your resources,’” Lee said. “Leading up to the election, I think that’s an important signal to send.”

The six defendants face charges including conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. None is currently in custody, but the Justice Department in recent years has eagerly charged foreign hackers in absentia in countries including Russia, China and Iran with the goal of creating a message of deterrence.

“No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously and irresponsibly as Russia, wantonly causing unprecedented collateral damage to pursue small tactical advantages as fits of spite,” said Demers, the Justice Department’s top national security official.

"Inside Foxconn’s empty buildings, empty factories, and empty promises in Wisconsin",96,je6b5l,https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump,6,1603157797.0,,"Hopes were high among the employees who joined Foxconn’s Wisconsin project in the summer of 2018. In June, President Donald Trump had broken ground on an LCD factory he called “the eighth wonder of the world.” The scale of the promise was indeed enormous: a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics giant, a 20 million-square-foot manufacturing complex, and, most importantly, 13,000 jobs.

Which is why new recruits arriving at the 1960s office building Foxconn had purchased in downtown Milwaukee were surprised to discover they had to provide their own office supplies. “One of the largest companies in the world, and you have to bring your own pencil,” an employee recalls wondering. Maybe Foxconn was just moving too fast to be bothered with such details, they thought, as they brought their laptops from home and scavenged pencils left behind by the building’s previous tenants. They listened to the cries of co-workers trapped in the elevators that often broke, noted the water that occasionally leaked from the ceiling, and wondered when the building would be transformed into the gleaming North American headquarters an executive had promised.

The renovations never arrived. Neither did the factory, the tech campus, nor the thousands of jobs. Interviews with 19 employees and dozens of others involved with the project, as well as thousands of pages of public documents, reveal a project that has defaulted on almost every promise. The building Foxconn calls an LCD factory — about 1/20th the size of the original plan — is little more than an empty shell. In September, Foxconn received a permit to change its intended use from manufacturing to storage.

Soon, the office began to fill with people who had nothing to do. Many just sat in their cubicles watching Netflix and playing games on their phones

Even the handful of jobs the company claims to have created are less than real: many of them held by people with nothing to do, hired so the company could reach the number required for it to get tax subsidy payments from Wisconsin. Foxconn failed at that objective, too: last week, Wisconsin rejected the company’s subsidy application and found it had employed only 281 people eligible under the contract at the end of 2019. Many have since been laid off.

Foxconn did not return repeated requests for comment.

It’s not unusual for either the Trump administration or Foxconn to make announcements that prove hollow. But for Foxconn, the show went on — for two years, the company, aided by the vocal support of the Wisconsin GOP, worked to maintain an illusion of progress in front of a business venture that never made economic sense.

Key Findings Foxconn said it would build a 20 million-square-foot LCD complex. Instead, it constructed an empty building 1/20th that size it calls the “Fab.” Records show Foxconn recently changed the intended use of the building from manufacturing to storage.

The company said it would aim to employ 5,200 people at the end of 2020, a number that was to grow to the promised 13,000 jobs. At the end of 2019, Wisconsin found Foxconn employed only 281 people eligible under the terms of the contract.

Foxconn attempted to exploit a loophole in its contract with the state by hiring a sufficient number of employees to receive subsidies just before the end of the year. Employees were hired with no actual work to do. Many were laid off after the deadline passed.

One recruiting program targeted foreign recent graduates on student visas. Employees say these workers were targeted because they would work longer hours for lower pay, and their immigration status was used as leverage.

Employees describe a toxic workplace, where supervisors often berated and publicly humiliated employees. Many of the original Wisconsin hires have quit or been laid off.

Despite publicly insisting it was building an LCD factory, as early as 2018, Foxconn employees had been asked to figure out a business plan for the company in Wisconsin.

Foxconn’s search for a viable business led it to consider everything from fish farming to exporting dairy to renting storage space. Almost every idea collapsed in corporate infighting and a reluctance to spend money.

Very little manufacturing ever occurred with the Foxconn project. Recently, the company set up a small manufacturing line for servers.

Foxconn raced to finish buildings and set up an assembly line in time for a visit from Trump during the 2020 campaign. It obtained a temporary occupancy permit for the empty factory building and tried to finish a glass sphere, which had no clear business purpose, before falling behind.

That illusion has had real costs. State and local governments spent at least $400 million, largely on land and infrastructure Foxconn will likely never need. Residents were pushed from their homes under threat of eminent domain and dozens of houses bulldozed to clear property Foxconn doesn’t know what to do with. And a recurring cycle of new recruits joined the project, eager to help it succeed, only to become trapped in a mirage.

Months after the 2018 groundbreaking, the company was racing to hire the 260 people needed to receive the first tranche of payments from the lucrative subsidy package passed by then-Gov. Scott Walker. Recruiters were told to hit the number but given little in the way of job descriptions. Soon, the office began to fill with people who had nothing to do. Many just sat in their cubicles watching Netflix and playing games on their phones. The reality of their situation became impossible to ignore. Multiple employees recall seeing people cry in the office. “The best is when you’re in the elevator with somebody and then they just scream out of nowhere,” said an employee who experienced this several times. “They’ve had enough, because things don’t make sense here.”

“Imagine being in a job where you don’t really know if it’s real or not. Or you know it’s not real, but you don’t know it’s not real. It’s a constant thing you’re doing in your head day after day,” said one employee, who returned to the rented building Trump had spoken at, where workers had been assembling TVs, only to find the line shut down and the lights dimmed a couple of weeks after the photo op was over. “I think all of us were on the verge of a major breakdown.”

It was just the beginning. Foxconn would spend the next two years jumping from idea to idea — fish farms, exporting ice cream, storing boats — in an increasingly surreal search for some way to generate money from a doomed project. Frequent leadership changes, a reluctance to spend money, and a domineering corporate culture would create an atmosphere employees described as toxic. Many of the employees The Verge spoke with have since left the company, and all of them requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. It has been a baffling ordeal for the people who thought they were building the Silicon Valley of the Midwest — “Wisconn Valley,” Walker called it — all the more so because so many others still believe the vision.

“All people see is the eighth wonder of the world,” said an employee. “I was there and it’s not real. I mean, it’s not. This is something I can’t talk about ever again, because people think you’re crazy, like none of this could ever happen. How could this happen in the US?”

Foxconn’s Wisconsin saga began two days after Trump’s inauguration, when the company’s founder and CEO, Terry Gou, told reporters he was considering building a $7 billion factory in the US and employing as many as 50,000 people.

CAST OF CHARACTERS Who’s who in the chaotic Foxconn deal Foxconn

Foxconn is a global technology manufacturing company headquartered in Taiwan. It manufactures everything from the iPhone to the Xbox, and it owns a number of consumer technology brands, including Belkin and Sharp. It is organized as a collection of competitive business groups that do not always agree. Terry Gou

The founder and former chairman of Foxconn who made the deal with President Trump and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Gou stepped down from Foxconn after claiming a sea goddess had appeared to him in a dream and told him to run for president of Taiwan. (He came in second in a primary election and dropped out.) He remains active with Foxconn and has toured the Wisconsin site as recently as October 2020. Louis Woo

The special assistant to Terry Gou who was in charge of the Wisconsin deal until he stepped down for personal reasons. Woo has said the scrutiny of the deal was like “living in a glass fishbowl.” FEWI

Flying Eagle Wisconsin, the Foxconn subsidiary run by Alan Yeung initially tasked with laying the foundation for the Wisconsin project. Fii

Foxconn Industrial Internet, a Foxconn spinoff run by Jay Lee and Brand Cheng that was placed in charge of the Wisconsin deal in May 2019 after the LCD group stalled. Importantly, Fii is not part of the original contract with the state of Wisconsin. Alan Yeung

The head of FEWI and one of Foxconn’s point men in Wisconsin, who famously insisted that the empty buildings Foxconn was purchasing around the state to use as “innovation centers” were not empty. (They are still empty.) Jay Lee

The chairman of Fii, brought in to revitalize the Wisconsin deal in May 2019, making him the third leader to helm the project in a year. Brand Cheng

The CEO of Fii, described by employees as a “tyrant” and a “bully.” WEDC

Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, a state-run organization that administers the Foxconn deal and approves the tax subsidies if the hiring quotas are met. Scott Walker

The former Republican governor of Wisconsin who famously wrote the original Foxconn contract on a single piece of stationery. That approach has not worked out. Tony Evers

The current Democratic governor of Wisconsin. Evers ran against Walker in part by promising to bring accountability to the Foxconn project. His oversight has been thwarted by fierce Republican opposition. Robin Vos

The Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, who represents the district the promised factory is in. A staunch defender of the deal. Joel Brennan

Wisconsin secretary of the Department of Administration, appointed by Evers. The state’s main official tasked with the Foxconn deal outside of WEDC. Peter Navarro

President Trump’s top trade adviser, who has been actively involved in figuring out what Foxconn should do in Wisconsin.

Such announcements are far from unusual for Gou, and often, nothing comes of them. In Vietnam in 2007, in Brazil in 2011, in Pennsylvania in 2013, and in Indonesia in 2014, Foxconn announced enormous factories that either fell far short of promises or never appeared. Just this year, the industries minister of Maharashtra, India, which aggressively pursued one of Gou’s multibillion-dollar projects in 2015, finally confirmed the factory isn’t coming, saying the state had learned a lesson about believing businesses promising big investments.

In China, where Foxconn employs the vast majority of its million workers, these sorts of announcements are called “state visit projects,” according to Willy Shih, a Harvard business school professor and former display industry consultant. Officials get a ribbon-cutting photo op, the company gets political goodwill, and everyone understands that the details of the contract are just an opening bid by a company that will ultimately do whatever makes economic sense. And in 2017, Gou, like many manufacturing companies with a dependency on China, had an obvious need for goodwill from Trump, who was threatening a trade war that Gou later told shareholders was Foxconn’s “biggest challenge.”

From a political perspective, Gou could hardly have done better than the Wisconsin deal: a factory in a swing state Trump narrowly won, where the Republican governor was campaigning for reelection on job creation, in the district of then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. From a business perspective, the project made less sense. Experts noted an impending glut in LCDs that would drive down prices, high local labor costs that would obliterate the industry’s thin margins, and a lack of key suppliers like the glass-maker Corning that would have to be paid to come to Wisconsin as well. Undeterred, the Trump administration arranged an April meeting between Gou and Walker, who proceeded to pursue Foxconn aggressively.

Even then, Foxconn was highly fluid about what exactly it was going to build. The company had originally floated two possible factories, a “generation 10.5 fabrication facility,” or “Gen 10.5 Fab,” which would manufacture large LCD screens and employ 8,800 people, or a smaller Gen 6 to make smaller LCDs and employ 5,200 people, according to a request for proposal obtained by The Verge. But Foxconn wanted $3 billion in subsidies, according to a source involved with the project, and Walker wanted a five-figure jobs number.

As Gou and Walker met over an early July visit to Wisconsin, the plan grew to nearly the size of both proposed factories combined, employing 13,000 people, and the state’s subsidy swelled from $1.5 billion to $3 billion, according to WEDC correspondence obtained in a records request. No one, according to the source, examined whether what Foxconn was proposing was commercially viable. “There was this assumption that they’re one of the biggest companies out there,” the source said. “Surely they know what they’re doing.” Those were the numbers written onto the single sheet of stationery Walker signed on July 12th to kick off the deal.

A contract with WEDC signed in November made it official: nearly $3 billion in “refundable” tax credits, most likely to be made in the form of direct payments to Foxconn. Combined with infrastructure the state promised to build, approximately $800 million in additional incentives mostly from the small town of Mount Pleasant, where the “Fab” was to be located, and other contributions, the package totaled more than $4 billion. In a best-case scenario, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau found the state wouldn’t break even until 2043. Depending on how many people Foxconn hired, each job would cost taxpayers somewhere between $200,000 and more than a million dollars. The average subsidy in the US is around $24,000 per job.

By the time Trump, Ryan, Walker, and Gou convened for the groundbreaking ceremony in Mount Pleasant on June 28th, 2018, Foxconn had already begun to waver. Days before, the company admitted that rather than building the Gen 10.5 Fab specified in its contract, it would instead build the smaller Gen 6, but still create 13,000 jobs. Two months later Foxconn executive Louis Woo told the local press there was another change: rather than manufacturing jobs, 90 percent of the roles would be researchers and engineers, a number that would mean Foxconn was creating a research campus in Southeastern Wisconsin three times the size of MIT. Woo said these researchers would be developing Foxconn’s “AI 8K+5G ecosystem,” something that, other than being a list of different technologies, has never been coherently explained.

Though Foxconn’s plans appeared in flux, state and local governments continued work on the infrastructure Foxconn had said it would need. Mount Pleasant’s village board voted to blight the area slated for the factory and threatened residents with eminent domain if they didn’t move.

By the end of the summer, Walker found himself in a tight reelection race against state school superintendent Tony Evers, a critic of the deal. Polling showed that few people felt the project would benefit their local economy, so Walker campaigned to show that all of Wisconsin would feel the effect of the “Foxconn bonus.” He was aided in this message by a string of announcements from Foxconn: a promised gift of $100 million to the University of Wisconsin-Madison; partnerships with local companies; and the purchase of buildings in far corners of the state that would become “innovation centers,” which Walker quickly featured in campaign ads. In September, Foxconn released a video rendering of its plans for Mount Pleasant: a futuristic corporate campus where employees read books as they took self-driving cars to work in glass orbs.

It wasn’t enough. Walker lost.

The election results fell like “a dark cloud” over Foxconn’s Milwaukee headquarters, in the words of one employee. The company had little progress to show the new administration. Rather than the 1,040 people Foxconn intended to hire by the end of 2018, per its contract with the state, or even the 260 needed in order to receive subsidies, an audit found the company had managed to hire only 113. At the Mount Pleasant campus, it had erected a single structure, a 120,000-square-foot space that sat virtually empty. Its very name, “the multi-purpose building,” seemed noncommittal. As for the promised LCD factory, the “Fab,” Foxconn boasted in a letter that a contractor had moved 4 million cubic yards of dirt. As 2018 came to an end, the company froze budgets and canceled planned career fairs. The project entered a complete stall.

The problem, employees soon learned, was that Foxconn’s planning did not extend far beyond the broad promises made to Wisconsin officials: an enormous LCD plant, some other manufacturing, lots of jobs. There appeared to be no research into the market for products Foxconn might make or the costs of producing those products in Wisconsin. Employees know this because many of them, no matter what role they had been hired for, were told to figure out what Foxconn should do in Wisconsin themselves.

“They asked me to create a business in Wisconsin, to come up with a business model, whatever I thought would make money,” said one of several engineers who was training in Taiwan when Foxconn called him home to help figure out what to do. He came to a conclusion shared by many who joined the project: “The most common misunderstanding with Foxconn is people here thought Foxconn had a strategy and a business plan when they were coming into Wisconsin. They did not. They had no plans at all.”

This state of affairs was obscured by the fact that Foxconn did seem to be doing something. It had bought buildings, moved dirt, and hired people. But this apparent progress, as well as much of the chaos that followed, can be explained by the company’s distributed power structure. While Gou has likened good leadership to dictatorship, his empire is too vast to be governed alone. The company is composed of a fluctuating number of around a dozen “business groups,” each responsible for a range of products, according to Jenny Chan, assistant professor of sociology at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and co-author of Dying for an iPhone, which examines Foxconn working conditions following a string of employee suicides in the 2010s. These business groups have a large degree of autonomy and are responsible for their own profitability, and are themselves made up of smaller units that also operate quasi-independently, even doing business and competing with other Foxconn entities.

Much of what had looked like progress in Wisconsin had been done by a Foxconn subsidiary called Flying Eagle Wisconsin, or FEWI, which had been created to lay the groundwork for the business groups that were supposed to actually manufacture things. And when it came time for Foxconn’s other business groups to invest in Wisconsin, they balked.

The first half of 2019 was, in the words of one employee, a “shoving match” between Gou and Foxconn’s business leaders over committing to what employees say seemed to be viewed as a money-losing debacle. “I was told on my first day, the only reason my business unit was there is because Terry Guo told them to go,” said an employee. Another employee was told by their supervisor that they were only in Wisconsin because the Trump administration wanted them to be, while three others recall a meeting where Woo, Gou’s special assistant, said that if it were up to him, Foxconn would immediately leave the state, but that they had to make Gou’s commitment work.

Falling Short

Jobs

Capital Investments

At one point, people were stuck without desks at the Milwaukee headquarters because the Foxconn subsidiaries they worked for refused to pay rent to FEWI, according to one employee. Recruiters say the Foxconn subsidiary charged with LCD manufacturing was slow to hire and seemed uninterested in moving the project forward. “They were never really there,” said one recruiter. “Then it just kind of fizzled.”

Foxconn’s vacillations spilled into public view in January 2019, when Woo told Reuters, “In Wisconsin we’re not building a factory,” having finally discovered it was unprofitable to make LCDs in the US. The comment caused an uproar. State Republicans swiftly blamed Evers for driving Foxconn out; the administration expressed surprise at the change; Trump spoke with Gou, and Foxconn immediately announced that LCD production was back on. “Great news on Foxconn in Wisconsin after my conversation with Terry Gou!” Trump tweeted, claiming credit for bringing Foxconn to Wisconsin a second time.

If the factory was meant to earn Trump’s goodwill, the January incident showed that the company couldn’t simply vanish as it had elsewhere. Foxconn was stuck in Wisconsin, and it needed to find a way to cut its losses. Employees at every level of the project were enlisted in a search for something — anything — Foxconn could do to generate revenue.

Alan Yeung, Foxconn’s director of US strategic initiatives, had a head start. As chief of FEWI, he had relatively free rein before budgets were frozen and Woo took on a greater role. But Yeung, employees say, had always been more interested in various eccentric side projects than manufacturing. Chief among them were the “innovation centers.” An innovation center, Yeung explained, would “help inspire innovative ideas,” “catalyze cutting-edge solutions,” and “play a key role in building a vibrant AI 8K+5G ecosystem.”

In reality, the “innovation centers” were meant to be co-working spaces. “Alan constantly referenced WeWork and how we should be following that model, thinking it was brilliant,” said an employee. It was branded “Blaze.”

But WeWork, as WeWork itself would soon prove, is a difficult business model to make profitable, particularly with buildings that required major renovations and were located in far-flung corners of Wisconsin. Foxconn did not approve funds to remodel the buildings. Still, Yeung persisted in trying to make Blaze happen. He solicited designs and awarded bids to contractors, who then sat for months waiting for instructions. (One is still waiting to be told what to do with an HVAC unit he bought more than a year ago.) He hired a Blaze “concierge,” who, because Blaze did not exist, simply sat in the Milwaukee headquarters with nothing to do. The buildings remained empty, save for their original tenants — banks, an architecture firm, other small businesses — which made them, ironically, one of the only profitable ventures Foxconn had in the state.

Foxconn in Mount Pleasant

1. Multipurpose building A 120,000-square-foot building constructed in late 2018. It initially sat empty but has since been the main site of what little manufacturing has happened in Wisconsin. 2. The Globe Initially meant to be a network operation center for a complex of data centers spelling out “Fii” from the air that was never built. The most recent plan is for the sphere to be an office and event space. 3. The Fab The centerpiece of the project. What was first meant to be an enormous Gen 10.5 LCD factory, then scaled down to a far smaller Gen 6, and now an empty shell of a building. In September, Foxconn received a permit to use it for storage. 4. Smart manufacturing center A 260,000-square-foot facility built by Fii, which says it will use it to manufacture server parts and employ 300 to 500 people.

With Blaze stalled, employees began convening to discuss literally any other idea to make money. They searched for things in Wisconsin they could export to China: cosmetics, designer handbags, ice cream, carp. Yeung asked them to draw up a plan for building an aquaponic fish farm in Mount Pleasant, having been inspired by a company in northern Wisconsin and reasoning that Foxconn had access to cheap water the state provided for LCD manufacturing. They briefly explored doing something with esports, maybe sponsoring a gaming team that could use the empty innovation centers, according to one source. A plan to export dairy to China got as far as a meeting with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture before collapsing. The department confirmed it met with Foxconn representatives about the plan in the spring of 2019 but said Foxconn paused “to conduct more research” and no additional discussions have taken place.

Yeung referred a request for comment to a Foxconn media representative, who did not respond.

Yeung’s other major FEWI initiative was something called “smart cities,” and for a time, it seemed to be getting traction. Yeung had found an eager audience for his smart city pitch in Cory Mason, the Democratic mayor of Racine, a deindustrialized city with high unemployment near Foxconn’s Mount Pleasant campus. At an October 2018 announcement of a smart city-focused “innovation center” in Racine, Mason had invoked the city’s history as a manufacturing powerhouse and predicted a return of past glory. “I think people are going to be very surprised and impressed with what we have ahead of us,” he said.

In meetings at Racine’s City Hall, Foxconn representatives and city officials started developing a plan, elements of which Racine submitted to a competition called the Smart Cities Readiness Challenge in 2019: camera-festooned autonomous vehicles would patrol high-crime areas, the city said in its proposal, guided by 5G cells mounted on lamp posts. Self-driving vehicles — retrofitted golf carts at first, then shuttles as soon as 2020 — would ferry Racine’s workers to Foxconn’s campus. Foxconn, the city noted in the submission, was a “particularly important stakeholder” and would help provide financing and technology.

Bored employees would come down from the Milwaukee headquarters to race the golf carts around the empty buildings, until the batteries finally died

In March 2019, Mason and Foxconn’s Woo released a memorandum of understanding to make the vision a reality, and the next month, Racine won the competition, the smallest city ever to do so.

But when city officials started asking basic questions about the sort of infrastructure they needed to build in order to accommodate Foxconn’s technology, Foxconn employees found they were unable to get clear answers from the company. “They were losing confidence, and then we parade in more new shiny ponies, and more people who couldn’t answer what should have been easy questions,” an employee said.

“The whole thing was a facade,” said another employee. “It was an idea that Alan baked up and tried to commit the business to. The business eventually said no, it doesn’t make sense, it costs too much money. Poor Racine was left scratching their head and saying, ‘What just happened?’”

Shannon Powell, Mason’s communications director, said Woo later told officials that Foxconn had to focus on its manufacturing project in Mount Pleasant and that the Smart City project was being put on indefinite hold. The city appears to have moved on: last September, Racine announced a new Smart City initiative — with US Cellular.

Foxconn only ever got as far as buying the golf carts. They arrived from China disassembled, in orange, pink, and other festive colors. One employee described them as “the biggest pieces of shit,” like something “bought off Wish.com.” Unable to make them autonomous, Foxconn put them in storage in the multipurpose building. At one point, the company discussed outfitting them with lights and turning them into security vehicles, but the subsidiary in charge of security refused to pay FEWI for the carts, according to one employee. As the divisions bickered, bored employees would come down from the Milwaukee headquarters to race the carts around the empty building, until the batteries finally died.

As Foxconn was secretly careening from idea to idea, Wisconsin Republicans ferociously insisted that the project was on track and did their best to derail any attempted oversight from the Evers administration. In April 2019, Vos swiftly attacked Evers after the governor mentioned that the contract with Foxconn would have to be revised, given that the company admitted it had changed plans from a Gen 10.5 factory to a Gen 6, with a likely reduced number of employees. “It is beyond my level of understanding to think that a governor of Wisconsin is basically rooting for the failure of the largest economic development in our state’s history,” Vos said, adding that he had met with Foxconn more times than he could count, and that “their goal has never wavered from creating 13,000 jobs.” Foxconn’s Yeung tweeted that Evers’ statement about the contract revision was “probably fake news,” adding a laugh-crying emoji.

It turned out that revising the contract had been Foxconn’s idea. Woo had proposed it to Evers the month before. Not that it mattered, because actually revising the contract would have required Foxconn to disclose its revised plans, and possibly because it had none, it refused to do so. Evers, whose control of WEDC had been limited by the Republican assembly during Walker’s lame duck period, appeared unable to penetrate the fog. Documents show an Evers administration official emailing Foxconn representatives repeatedly in June and July 2019, saying that employees in Wisconsin don’t seem to know when the factory will be finished, what it will make, or how many people will work there.

But a growing number of people who had tried to work with the company were starting to notice something wasn’t right.

By spring 2019, business owners who had tried to become Foxconn suppliers realized they had been ghosted. The year before, WEDC had held a series of events to connect Foxconn with local suppliers. One attendee The Verge spoke with entered his business into the supply chain system and never heard back; another had the company go dark after several meetings; a third says he filled out an extensive survey only for a consultant to request approximately $10,000 to have his business vetted for Foxconn’s mysterious project. (He declined.) One explanation for this is simple: Foxconn, not knowing what it was going to make, hadn’t known what suppliers it needed. “We’d take their name, and we’d never call them again,” acknowledged a Foxconn employee.

Of the $100 million gift Gou promised the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the school confirmed that only $700,000 ever arrived

Wisconsinites who attended the company’s enormous hiring events fared little better. Especially during the late 2018 hiring spree, these events could have what employees describe as a “speed-dating”-like atmosphere, with applicants offered jobs on the spot and given 24 hours to accept. The problem was that the Wisconsin project never had a conventional budget: everything from printing business cards to hiring people had to be sent back to Taiwan for approval, a process that could last months and which often ended in a denial. (Precisely who had power to approve budgets was a mysterious and always shifting matter for the Wisconsin employees; for a time, they say expenses required the approval of a figure referred to exclusively as “Money Mama.”) This put recruiters in the position of hiring for jobs they thought were real, only to delay start dates and sometimes rescind offers entirely. “They destroyed a lot of lives with false hope and promise for something that never happened,” said an employee.

“It was such a charade, looking back on the whole thing,” said Chris, who attended a career fair in Mount Pleasant in late 2018 and asked that only his first name be used. Foxconn had heavily advertised its recruiting of military veterans like himself, and he was excited “as a lifelong cheesehead” about the prospect of Wisconsin becoming a tech hub. So he was thrilled when, after an interview with Yeung, he was handed a letter, viewed by The Verge, declaring the company’s intent to hire him in two weeks. He left his current job — he had been planning to anyway — and waited. Two weeks came and went. He followed up and was told Foxconn was just trying to find the perfect role for him. Then he was told he would be placed on a different team, but the team leaders were in China and would be back in two weeks. Then he was told to come to Milwaukee to meet them. Then Foxconn canceled. Eventually, he found another job.

“I just realized there was no there there,” Chris said. “Now whenever I see them in the news, I laugh and flip the channel, because I just don’t believe any of it. I just wonder, at the end of the day, what was their endgame? What did Foxconn get out of it? Why the elaborate statewide charade?”

Many Wisconsin institutions had reason to ask that question. Earlier partnerships announced with local companies like Rockwell Automation had been followed by total silence. (Employees say they quickly fizzled; Rockwell did not return a request for comment.) Of the $100 million gift Gou promised the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the school confirmed that only $700,000 ever arrived.

Meanwhile, employees dispatched in search of business ideas had worked out deals and partnerships with local companies only to have Foxconn leadership not move forward. Eventually, they started running into bridges that prior Foxconn delegations had already burned. “Every place we tried to go, somebody from Foxconn had already been there and they’d already pissed them off,” said an employee.

Foxconn, according to two employees, turned to one of the few remaining friendly prospects: the Trump administration. Woo flew to DC to meet with Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, who suggested Foxconn become a vendor to the US General Services Administration (GSA), the agency that procures products for the federal government, according to an employee with knowledge of the visit. Foxconn named the initiative Project Red, White, and Blue.

Every plan seemed to stall or get vetoed by Foxconn leadership

Navarro did not respond to a request for comment, but on July 12th, 2019, he told CNBC that Foxconn representatives had visited his office and that “the White House is actively engaged” with the company and helping it overcome any obstacles it might face. (He also disputed the suggestion that the project had been scaled down and said Evers was “not a friend of ours, and he’s not a friend of the project.”)

The solution had a neat circularity to it — a government-subsidized project meant to earn government goodwill finding salvation in selling back to the government — but like almost everything Foxconn tried, it ended in failure. Employees searched for products Foxconn already made that were eligible for the GSA, but everything was either unprofitable or already being sold by major Foxconn customers like Dell and Cisco, according to a source with knowledge of the project, which would mean Foxconn would risk undermining actually profitable business relationships to salvage the Wisconsin project.

Increasingly desperate, Foxconn cast about for companies willing to move into the industrial park. Employees looked for local manufacturers that might rent space in the “Fab,” restaurants and cafes that might want to use its real estate, even companies that wanted to use its abundant land to store construction equipment, snowmobiles, or boats.

Every plan seemed to stall or get vetoed by Foxconn leadership. “All we did was create slide decks to get beat up by executives,” said an employee. “It was extremely frustrating,” said another. “I left a very good job to come there.”

In May, Gou returned to Wisconsin. Meeting with Evers on his way back from another visit to the White House, the founder, now running for president of Taiwan, said Foxconn’s plans had “never changed” and that LCD production would begin in May 2020. Evers appeared to backtrack on his previous criticism, saying he didn’t doubt Foxconn’s word.

But employees saw that yet another pivot was afoot. They were told to gather in Mount Pleasant, and Gou introduced a new face: Jay Lee, a University of Cincinnati professor and vice chairman of Foxconn Industrial Internet (Fii), a Foxconn company that makes networking equipment. The third leader in less than a year had been dispatched to Wisconsin.

Employees greeted Fii’s arrival with cautious optimism. Fii was ascendant in the Foxconn empire, having spun off from the main company and gone public in China in 2018, and its focus on automation made it less subject to the higher labor cost of operating in the US. Most importantly, Fii had money: it finally authorized funds to repair the Milwaukee office’s temperamental elevators. In September, Fii announced the first manufacturing deal of the Foxconn project, a temporary contract to make coffee vending machines for a company called Briggo.

But Fii also brought a cultural shift to Foxconn in Wisconsin. Employees say that while Fii’s Jay Lee was preoccupied with starting a vague “AI Institute” and giving talks on automation, the real power lay with Fii CEO Brand Cheng. In interviews, employees referred to Cheng as “the tyrant,” “the bully,” and “mini-Terry,” for a managerial style he took from Gou, who himself cites Genghis Khan as a personal hero and whose book of quotations, which workers at Foxconn’s Chinese factories sometimes have to transcribe as punishment, includes aphorisms like “growth, thy name is suffering.”

“My god, the incessant screaming, it was like a Saturday Night Live skit,” recalled one employee. Two employees witnessed and others heard about an incident in which Cheng, leaving a meeting, saw the elevator open and began berating an employee for having failed to replace its carpeting, which Cheng found ugly. The employee, an early hire and a veteran, protested that he had only been using the byzantine expense approval process Cheng himself had demanded they follow; this process, employees say, seemed designed to not pay bills, and meant the nominal purchase of new carpet squares had to be sent overseas for approval.

“My god, the incessant screaming, it was like a Saturday Night Live skit.”

“Brand just blew up, and said, ‘This is ridiculous, I could do it myself in a couple of hours, you don’t know what you’re doing, why are you here?’” one employee recalled. “Here’s a Navy officer being publicly embarrassed like that, and everybody felt horrible for him. And the next thing is ‘oh, shit, when’s it going to happen to me?”

The employee quit shortly afterward, they said. (He did not respond to inquiries.) Afterward, others went out and bought the carpet themselves. “It was done just so Brand would stop screaming,” said an employee. “People were using a lot of their own money just to avoid bad situations.”

“I thought that was mild,” another employee said of the elevator incident. What stood out to him and another employee was a meeting in which Cheng, yelling at a co-worker, made his hand into the shape of a gun. “He said, ‘If you don’t get your job done, I’ll get somebody who can, it’ll be just like this,” the employee recalled. “He put it right to the guy’s temple and pulled the trigger.”

But everyone knew Cheng was hesitant to actually fire anyone because Foxconn still had to hit the subsidy threshold, so all there was to do was scream. Even Yeung came in for it, employees said, with Cheng making belittling comments about his bad business sense. The Wisconsin employees, accustomed to the more polite environments of Midwestern offices, were appalled by these outbursts. They learned to sit along the walls in meetings, far from Cheng; when Cheng was overseas, they jockeyed for seats out of the webcam’s frame. Someone from HR tailed Cheng around the office in an apparent attempt to intervene before disaster, one employee said. The new management seemed increasingly open in its disdain for the local workforce. “Why are Americans paid so much and do so little? I can’t tell you how many times we heard that,” said one employee. “It was certainly a toxic work environment,” said another. “There’s no reason you can’t be nice and respectful.”

Neither Cheng nor Lee returned requests for comment.

Perhaps sensing all was not well, Lee ordered everyone to watch the documentary American Factory, about a Chinese automotive glass company that buys a shuttered GM plant in Dayton, Ohio. But employees watched the film — in which hopes for a manufacturing resurgence in the Midwest founder amid culture clashes and differing labor standards, Chinese supervisors explain that Americans are lazy and need to be flattered (“Donkeys like being touched in the direction their hair grows”), and in which American management is eventually fired and replaced with Chinese leadership — with the dawning horror of recognition.

“We were like, ‘Oh my god.’ That’s exactly what’s occurring at Foxconn,” said an employee. “This is not a good thing. This is bad! But he couldn’t tell.”

It wasn’t long before Fii encountered the same lack of direction and reluctance to invest that had beset the earlier iterations of the Foxconn project. In September, Fii submitted plans for two buildings: a 261,000-square-foot manufacturing center and a nine-story glass sphere the company said would be a network operations center for an adjacent server farm, only to withdraw the sphere plans later the same day.

Fii was partly running on IT equipment an employee brought in from home, and the Mount Pleasant facilities had its internet temporarily shut off over unpaid bills

The original plan had been grandiose: the sphere was to be the dot in the “i” of a complex of data centers spelling out “Fii” when viewed from the air. But according to three employees, Foxconn balked at the cost. An employee with knowledge of the project said that Foxconn finally moved forward with the sphere — and only the sphere — when the architect told the company it had to put a deposit down for the steel if construction was going to finish in time for a long-promised visit from Trump.

But the building without the data centers was just a glass orb in a field — at best, “really, really, really expensive office space,” in the words of one employee. Adding to Fii’s troubles, FEWI, also trying to cut its losses, had “tricked” Fii into buying more land than was needed for the sphere, according to a second employee. A Foxconn executive briefly entertained an elegant solution, according to two employees: starting a Foxconn tree farm, so the company could get free trees for the terrarium-like interior of the sphere that Gou wanted, and sell the excess trees for profit.

“It’s endless,” said an employee, noting with frantic exasperation that the sorts of tropical trees Foxconn wanted can’t even grow in Wisconsin’s climate. “When you’re desperate and you have no product to sell and the only asset you have is land, what can you do? You build on it or you grow crops on it.”

Hopes that Fii would right the ship were fading. There were the same shifting plans, the same reluctance to spend money. Fii itself was partly running on IT equipment an employee brought in from home, according to an employee, and the Mount Pleasant facilities had its internet temporarily shut off over unpaid bills, according to two others.

It was the same as it always was, but now with more yelling.

There were always two hard deadlines under Fii: the Trump visit and the cutoff for hiring enough people to get subsidies. The Trump visit was codenamed the “505 project” because it was originally scheduled for May 5th, 2020, before Foxconn’s delays and then COVID-19 turned it into the “909 project,” then postponed it indefinitely.

“There was supposed to be a big announcement and a ribbon cutting that would coincide with Trump coming to town, which would also coincide with his campaign trail,” said an employee. “The joke there was, what’s he going to be cutting the ribbon to?” There was talk of reviving the still-not-self-driving Smart City golf carts. Employees joked about having someone stationed behind a curtain, steering the president around via remote control.

Some employees hoped that a visit from the president would give Foxconn the impetus it needed to finally figure out a business and begin manufacturing. But as the date approached, the event became more of a trade show. With the “Fab” empty, and certainly not making LCDs, the plan became to use the smaller multipurpose building for the event.

A demonstration manufacturing line making circuit boards was to be set up, along with kiosks from tech companies that, while not currently buying products from Foxconn’s Wisconsin operation, theoretically might have done so in the future. In lieu of the data center Foxconn had scrapped, a shipping container-sized modular data center was to be brought in to sit beside the hastily constructed sphere, an odd disco ball-like rendition of the sleek domes built elsewhere by Amazon and Apple. It would be even less real than the groundbreaking Trump presided over more than two years before — as one employee pointed out, at least they sold some of the TVs made on the assembly line set up for that event.

“We were going to have a fake data center there, and all these brands that we don’t have relationships with, and we were going to plead that we were doing business with them,” said another employee involved in the planning. “Oh my god, that was distasteful.”

But it was the other goal, the subsidy hiring quota, that would come to consume Fii and ultimately crush what few remaining hopes Wisconsin employees had for the project.

As Vos and other fierce defenders of the Foxconn deal often point out, the state’s contract is performance-based. The company only gets paid subsidies from the state if it employs a certain number of people each year. But this mechanism also creates a perverse incentive: because employees are only counted at the end of the year and their pay is annualized to see if it meets the minimum yearly salary, Foxconn could hire people in the final weeks of the year, get tens of millions in subsidies, and be free to lay them off once the quota filing deadline passed. (In an interview with The Verge, current Wisconsin Department of Administration Secretary Joel Brennan called this “one of the real weaknesses of the contract” and indicated it was something the state would like to revise.) Meeting the hiring quotas was Foxconn’s best chance at recouping some of the losses incurred after two years spent flailing around Wisconsin and erecting empty buildings. It had failed in 2018; it couldn’t afford to do so again.

Foxconn could hire people in the final weeks of the year, get tens of millions in subsidies, and be free to lay them off once the filing deadline passed

By October 2019, the company was falling behind, and Cheng instituted a daily morning meeting. “Brand came in, and started screaming at the table and saying, your group, you’re going to hire this many, so and so is going to hire this many, even if they didn’t need them,” said an employee. “It was purely nothing more than bringing people onboard to hit a number.”

Foxconn devised two programs to meet the quota. The first, called Earn and Learn, was marketed as a way for students at nearby colleges to work at Foxconn as they finished their degrees. There was no work for them to do, but provided they badged into Foxconn buildings they would count toward the company’s employment quota. “Everyone was watching YouTube or doing homework,” said an employee.

The other initiative, called Foxconn Future Leaders, targeted recent college graduates, preferably foreign students in the US on visas, according to multiple employees. “He pointed out several times that they were cheaper than US college graduates and they’ll work harder,” an employee recalled Cheng saying. There was a sense among employees familiar with the program that the need for an employer to sponsor their visa meant the recruits would be willing to relocate and work for less money. “These kids, they’re just looking to stay in the country,” said an employee.

Foxconn contracted with a recruiting service that found the students. A makeshift call center was set up, with employees hiring after cursory conversations, according to an employee who witnessed the operation.

An employee who went through the program received a message from the recruiting firm on LinkedIn. He already had a good offer in his home city on the East Coast, but in his brief phone interview, a Foxconn representative told him the company would sponsor his H1B application. He decided to take it and packed to move to Wisconsin.

“You’re an H1B, I’m an EB2, if you don’t work hard enough, if you don’t work overtime, I can get you back to Mainland China anytime.”

When he arrived, he experienced the familiar Foxconn shock: there was no work to do. More alarming, managers said if he did not find a place in a business group in six months, he’d be let go. (The offer letter, viewed by The Verge, makes no mention of this, but other employees likened survival at Foxconn to a game of musical chairs in which they had to politick their way into whichever business group seemed to currently have money.) “This ruined my career,” said the employee, who eventually found a new job in his home city and fled.

While the American employees were ridiculed for being lazy, the Future Leaders, many of whom were from China and India, were pushed to work overtime, sometimes without pay, according to employees. Two employees recalled an incident in which a manager at the multipurpose building, in which Foxconn was setting up a small circuit board manufacturing line, used a worker’s immigration status as leverage in demanding overtime work, an event also corroborated by screenshots of employee correspondence. “He was yelling, ‘you’re an H1B, I’m an EB2, if you don’t work hard enough, if you don’t work overtime, I can get you back to Mainland China anytime,’” said an employee familiar with the incident.

An employee involved with recruiting estimates that by mid-October, 90 percent of the offers he dealt with were for visa holders who would need sponsorship. Department of Labor data shows Foxconn’s Wisconsin operation filed 82 precursor applications for H1B visas in the final months of 2019 and the first half of 2020.

According to the company’s subsidy application, it employed 580 people at the end of 2019. Sixty percent were hired in the final two months

By December, Foxconn had hired so many students and graduates it had to put them in the multipurpose building and a nearby rented space, where they sat at folding card tables watching cooking videos and doing schoolwork. In the Milwaukee headquarters, cubicles were torn out and replaced with long tables where people sat shoulder to shoulder. “You needed a plunger to force people in the building, it was so packed with people,” said an employee.

The program, from Foxconn’s perspective, was a success. In December, Gou returned to Wisconsin following yet another visit to the White House, where he said Trump told him to “bring more jobs to Wisconsin.” Lee claimed they had already done so, boasting that by the end of the year, Foxconn would have “well beyond” the 520 employees they need to receive subsidies.

According to the company’s subsidy application, it employed 580 people at the end of 2019. Sixty percent were hired in the final two months.

The layoffs began with the new year. Starting in January, when the promised LCD factory was originally scheduled to open, Foxconn instead began letting employees go in batches.

“It was a pump and dump,” said an employee. Many of the Wisconsin residents were laid off, as were many of the local college students. Some of Foxconn’s first hires had already left, including Tank Murdoch, who held a golden shovel alongside Trump at the groundbreaking ceremony, and Peter Buck, who often served as the public face of the project and employees say quit in frustration. (Neither returned requests for comment.) An employee involved with recruiting estimated in June that Foxconn’s ranks had fallen by approximately half from its end-of-year peak, with foreign employees making up a large share of those who remained. “Mandarin is spoken more than English on my floor now,” the employee said.

Gou returned in February, and there were rumors a White House representative would attend. The ranks of local workers from Wisconsin had diminished to the point where, according to two employees, Asian employees were told to stay out of an employee photo with Gou “to show diversity in the company.”

In many ways, the Foxconn debacle in Wisconsin is the physical manifestation of the alternate reality that has defined the Trump administration. Trump promised to bring back manufacturing, found a billionaire eager to play along, and now for three years the people of Wisconsin have been told to expect an LCD factory that plainly is not there. Into the gap between appearance and reality fell people’s jobs, homes, and livelihoods.

The buildings Foxconn has erected are largely empty. The sphere has no clear purpose. The innovation centers are still vacant. The heart of the project, the million-square-foot “Fab,” is just a shell. In what an employee says was a final cost-cutting measure, only the portion that was to host the Trump visit was ever finished. Recent documents show the “Fab,” once intended for use as manufacturing, has been reclassified as a massive storage facility.

WEDC, as part of its audit of the company’s 2019 subsidy application, had Foxconn survey its employees about what they were working on. Not a single respondent mentioned LCDs because no one is working on LCDs, and they never were.

The project has fallen orders of magnitude short of its hiring and investment targets. WEDC found Foxconn had only 281 eligible employees at the end of 2019, 13 percent of what it had originally aimed for. (Many of the employees Foxconn tried to claim were paid too little or hired too late in the year to get a paycheck in 2019.) After this year’s layoffs, it is nowhere near meeting its 2020 target of 5,200 employees. Foxconn itself acknowledged, in its subsidy submission, that it has so far invested 2.8 percent of the $10 billion it promised. It has built less than 2 percent of the 20 million square feet of manufacturing space it originally planned.

The state is at an impasse. It can deny further subsidies, as it did last week, but taxpayer money has already been spent. The Village of Mount Pleasant took on hundreds of millions in debt that was supposed to be repaid by property taxes on Foxconn’s fantastic campus. It will now have to hope Foxconn honors its contractual obligation to make up the shortfall. (In a joint statement following the state’s subsidy rejection, Mount Pleasant and Racine officials said they were “disappointed in the State’s decision to not support the creation of the Gen 6 facility,” that they observe “significant construction activity” in the Village, and that Foxconn “continues to fulfill its financial obligations under the local contract.”)

“The state has upheld our part of the contract,” said DOA’s Joel Brennan. “Unfortunately, Foxconn hasn’t been able to do that on their side.” Brennan and WEDC officials continue to say they’re open to revising the contract to reflect whatever it is that Foxconn is now doing. Employees say that the company is now making servers, and Foxconn has announced it is making ventilators, though no employees or state officials could say whether any have been produced. Yet, Foxconn has so far refused to amend the contract. The company continues to insist, against all evidence, that an LCD factory is on its way.

Foxconn, in its desperate quest to keep up appearances, failed repeatedly and in ways more destructive than mere ordinary failure would have been

This steadfast rejection of reality is where the Foxconn debacle stands apart from other development projects that fall short of their hype. The company’s desperate quest to maintain appearances caused it to fail repeatedly and in ways more destructive than mere ordinary failure would have been: local businesses were strung along, civil servants spent years figuring out what the company is doing, residents were removed from land the company didn’t need, and again and again recruits were lured in by the vision of a grand manufacturing renaissance in Wisconsin.

That vision got Gou regular access to the White House during a trade war and gave Trump a groundbreaking and almost a ribbon-cutting, too. But maintaining the mirage required a culture of secrecy. Employees were warned not to talk to the press (including, specifically, me). Many were afraid to speak — afraid of getting fired, or of retribution even after they’d left. Publicly, the company issued announcement after announcement — innovation centers, career fairs, smart cities, AI 8K+5G, the AI Institute — each one erasing the memory of the last missed deadline. (One employee quipped that one of the few things Foxconn succeeded in making in Wisconsin was press releases.) The illusion was defended by GOP officials at all levels of government, from Mount Pleasant to the State Assembly to the White House, who accused anyone pointing out that the project was off track of trying to scuttle it for partisan ends, as if the existence of the factory were open to debate and positive thinking might make it real.

But in actual reality, the project has succeeded in manufacturing mostly this: an endless supply of wonderful things for the President to promise his supporters. This past weekend, in an interview with a local Wisconsin TV station, Trump insisted Foxconn had built “one of the most incredible plants I’ve ever seen” in Mount Pleasant and would keep its promises and more if he was reelected. “They will do what I tell them to do,” he said. “If we win the election, Foxconn is going to come into our country with money like no other company has come into our country.”

No one wanted to believe promises like this more than the people who went to work for Foxconn in Wisconsin. They each came to regret different things: the wasted time, the jobs they’d left, the integrity lost making deals and offering jobs only to have the company change course. But one common theme was frustration that it hadn’t turned out to be real and that long after they’d learned the truth, they saw the facade still standing. “There are a lot of good people who fell for this,” said one employee, shortly before departing a job at Foxconn. “Who wanted to see it succeed.”

“We got screwed,” another former employee said. “The state got screwed.”

LONDON — The number of reported coronavirus cases around the world has hit 40 million, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The grim milestone of 40,050,902 confirmed cases on Monday comes as various parts of Europe and the U.S. struggle to deal with an alarming surge in infections. The dreaded ""second wave"" began in August in Europe, following the relaxation of national lockdowns implemented in spring. European governments have scrambled to contain a surge in cases by re-introducing a raft of restrictive measures on public life and the hospitality sector, including the closure or limited opening of pubs, bars and restaurants, restricting social gatherings and even resorting to curfews, now seen in a handful of major French cities, including Paris.

The WHO warned on Friday that Europe's coronavirus outbreak is ""concerning"" as the number of available intensive care beds continues to dwindle and near capacity in some regions. When adjusting for population, the number of new coronavirus infections in Europe has now overtaken that in the U.S., with Europe reporting 187 new Covid-19 cases per million people, based on a seven-day average, compared with 162 new Covid-19 cases per million people in the U.S. In the U.S., daily new cases continue to rise in more than half of states as debate rages over the effectiveness of public safety measures touted by the country's top health experts."

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Seven years after his death to cancer at age 18, a Minnesota singer-songwriter has returned to the top of the iTunes chart with his inspirational tune “Clouds.”

The Star Tribune reports that “Clouds” by Zach Sobiech took over iTunes’ No. 1 slot from Justin Bieber on Sunday, two days after the Hollywood movie of the same name based on Sobiech’s life premiered on Disney+.

The ranking is based on downloads of the song. The profits will add to the $2 million already raised for cancer research via Sobiech’s namesake foundation.

The single first climbed to the top of iTunes in 2013, shortly after the Stillwater-area teenager’s death. He had been diagnosed with bone cancer four years earlier.

By that point, the YouTube video that led to the song’s ascent had been viewed 4 million times. It’s up over 15 million now. The song also went to No. 26 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and No. 3 on the rock singles chart.

The movie is an adaptation of the memoir “Fly a Little Higher” by Zach’s mother, Laura Sobiech.

Chileans turn bakers and pizza makers as pandemic sparks business boom silver lining,22,je1no1,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-jobs-informal-idUSKBN27418B,3,1603143001.0,,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean Pedro Campos hatched a plan to bake and sell homemade sourdough bread to neighbors after riots in Santiago last year shuttered the restaurant where he worked and the coronavirus pandemic left many shops closed. Business is now booming.

Slideshow ( 5 images )

Campos is not alone in reinventing himself. More than 2 million Chileans have lost their jobs in the past year, the result of a one-two punch from the mass protests in 2019 and the pandemic this year.

Campos told Reuters the predicament forced him to learn a new trade. “I needed to start making something,” he said.

Now he doubts he’ll ever go back to work for someone else.

The size of the informal sector - unreported, often clandestine jobs that range from selling masks on the street to ad hoc construction work - is hard to measure.

But the trend has prompted the government to launch a ‘Your Company in a Day’ campaign to legalize and cut red tape for entrepreneurs like Campos. In August alone, economy ministry data show that 16,545 companies were created, around a fifth more than a year earlier - despite the health crisis.

Small local businesses are flourishing on social media and chat groups like WhatsApp, offering items from food and beverages to jewelry and even bikes.

“This shows that people know entrepreneurship can be an alternative source of employment, and a way to reinvent themselves with economic support that allows them to get ahead,” economy ministry undersecretary Esteban Carrasco told reporters.

Andrés, who lost his job as a chef in a restaurant, joined with two partners to create a “virtual pizzeria,” whose menu he promotes with photos on Instagram. They deliver pizzas by bike.

Andres - who didn’t want to give his last name because the work remains “underground” and informal - said booming sales were encouraging them to set up a bigger, better business model.

“We have a lot of underground sales to wholesalers who buy 50 pizzas from us and resell them in their condos or to their contacts,” he said."
New York Post Published Hunter Biden Report Amid Newsroom Doubts,215,jdv3ei,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/business/media/new-york-post-hunter-biden.html,62,1603110408.0,,"Headlined “BIDEN SECRET E-MAILS,” the article appeared Wednesday with two bylines: Emma-Jo Morris, a deputy politics editor who joined the paper after four years at the Murdoch-owned Fox News, and Gabrielle Fonrouge, a Post reporter since 2014.

Ms. Morris did not have a bylined article in The Post before Wednesday, a search of its website showed. She arrived at the tabloid in April after working as an associate producer on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, according to her LinkedIn profile. Her Instagram account, which was set to private on Wednesday, included photos of her posing with the former Trump administration members Mr. Bannon and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, as well as Roger J. Stone Jr., a friend and former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump. (In July, the president commuted the sentence of Mr. Stone on seven felonies.)

Ms. Fonrouge had little to do with the reporting or writing of the article, said three people with knowledge of how it was prepared. She learned that her byline was on the story only after it was published, the people said.

The article relied on documents purportedly taken from the hard drive to suggest that the elder Mr. Biden, as vice president, had directed American foreign policy in Ukraine to benefit his son, a former board member of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company.

The article also suggested that the elder Mr. Biden had met with a Burisma adviser, Vadym Pozharskyi. On Wednesday, a Biden campaign spokesman said that Mr. Biden’s official schedules showed no meeting between the former vice president and the adviser. Last month, two Republican-led Senate committees investigating the matter said they had found no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president.

“The senior editors at The Post made the decision to publish the Biden files after several days’ hard work established its merit,” Mr. Allan said in an email.

The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal have reported that they could not independently verify the data in the Post article, which included hedging language, referring at one point to an email “allegedly sent” to Hunter Biden."

World's major social media giants, Twitter and Facebook, have limited access to a story making a controversial claim about the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Joe Biden.

Reuters reported that the story was published by The New York Post on Wednesday, October 14.

Legit.ng gathers that the story contained alleged details of Hunter’s controversial business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company.

It also claimed that the Democratic presidential candidate had met with an adviser of the company.

The story reportedly sourced details to emails that it said were given to the lawyer of Rudy Giuliani who is President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer.

Legit.ng notes that the controversial business dealings of Biden's son resurfaced again as the United States prepare for the November 2020 presidential election.

Twitter reportedly prohibited its users from posting links to The New York Post's story while Facebook reduced access to it by limiting how often it shows up in users’ news feeds and elsewhere on the Facebook platform.

Twitter explained that the story violated its “hacked materials” policy.

The policy reportedly bars the distribution of content obtained through hacking that contains private information or trade secrets, or puts people at risk of physical harm.

In its own explanation, Facebook cited a policy saying it can temporarily take action against content pending review by news organisations and others in its third-party fact-checking programme if there are signals that the content is false.

Speaking on the development, the spokesperson of the Biden campaign organisation, Andrew Bates, said the Republican-led Senate committees have previously concluded that Biden did not engage in any wrongdoing over his son’s business dealings.

President Trump in his own reaction condemned the move by the social media platforms to limit access to the story and reportedly hinted on a threat of regulatory action.

Trump blasts Michigan governor Whitmer; crowd chants 'lock her up',320,jdmrx4,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-michigan/trump-blasts-michigan-governor-whitmer-crowd-chants-lock-her-up-idUSKBN27206V,90,1603078858.0,,"JANESVILLE, Wis./WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, who played down the coronavirus pandemic from its onset, criticized Michigan’s Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer on Saturday for her policies to curb the outbreak, drawing shouts of “lock her up” from a rally crowd.

Trump made the remarks during the first stop of a three-day trip through critical swing states, some of which he won in 2016 but that polls show are supporting Democratic rival Joe Biden this year.

The president held large rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan despite rising coronavirus cases in both states. Supporters who attended the rallies did not maintain social distance. Some wore masks, some did not.

At a rally in Muskegon, Michigan, Trump targeted Whitmer several times, criticizing the state’s rules to stop the spread of coronavirus, calling her “dishonest,” and making light of a right-wing plot uncovered by the FBI to kidnap her.

“They said she was threatened,” Trump said. “And she blamed me.” The president has been critical of Whitmer, who was a candidate to be Biden’s vice presidential nominee, for months.

“Hopefully you’ll be sending her packing pretty soon,” Trump said.

The crowd’s chant of “Lock her up!” referring to Whitmer reprised the chants that Trump supporters often direct at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.

Whitmer responded on Twitter to the episode. “This is exactly the rhetoric that has put me, my family, and other government officials’ lives in danger while we try to save the lives of our fellow Americans,” she wrote.

Lee Chatfield, the Republican speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, also commented on Twitter: “Trump didn’t chant ‘lock her up’ about our Governor. But others did and it was wrong. She was literally just targeted. Let’s debate differences. Let’s win elections. But not that.”

Michigan added 1,791 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, bringing the state’s seven-day total to over 10,000 cases, a new record, according to the state’s health department. Wisconsin reported 3,861 new COVID cases on Friday, also a new record. Trump won both states four years ago but is behind Biden in them this year.

Biden, a former vice president, has hammered Trump for his response to the pandemic, which has killed more than 219,000 people in the United States, the highest death toll in the world. He said in a statement on Saturday he planned to unite the country to fight the virus if he wins.

“All President Trump is offering the people of Michigan is more lies and distractions — no plan to get the virus under control, no strategy for pulling our economy out of this recession, no vision for uniting the country,” Biden said.

‘INSECURITY AND ENVY’

His campaign called Trump’s remarks about Whitmer “toxic attacks”, and said his conduct “reflects his own insecurity and envy of Governor Whitmer’s respected record of leadership in a time of crisis.”

Trump sought to turn Biden’s criticism around on Saturday by saying that his rival would impede the recovery from the outbreak.

“Biden will shut down the country, delay the vaccine and prolong the pandemic,” Trump said at both rallies.

Trump’s advisers have long seen Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as Pennsylvania, as key to his chances of re-election. The president is also playing defense in traditional Republican strongholds, including Arizona, where he plans to campaign on Monday, and Georgia, where he campaigned on Friday night.

He plans to campaign in Nevada, a state Clinton won in 2016, on Sunday.

Trump lags in opinion polls polling.reuters.com and the latest figures from his campaign show he is also trailing in fundraising as the race intensifies. Early voting is shattering records, with more than 26 million Americans having already cast ballots.

Biden, who has stepped up travel in recent weeks after keeping a reduced schedule because of the pandemic, remained in his home state of Delaware on Saturday.

His running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, is also eschewing travel for a few days after an aide came down with COVID-19.

Harris, speaking on Saturday during a virtual fundraiser, said Trump had exhibited a “reckless disregard for human life” in his response to the pandemic.

She said a Biden-Harris administration would have a vaccine distribution plan that takes into account “the long-standing and most evident racial disparities that have wreaked havoc on particular communities.”

U.S. presidential elections are determined by electoral votes, allotted to U.S. states and territories based largely on their populations, rather than a tally of the popular vote nationwide. Candidates must secure 270 out of 538 electoral votes to win.

Wisconsin has 10 electoral votes, Michigan has 16 and Arizona has 11. Nevada has six electoral votes.

Trump, who usually avoids wearing a mask, repeated on Saturday that the country is turning the corner on the disease, shortly after the number of U.S. cases crossed 8 million, rising by 1 million in less than a month."
Hungarian restaurant reinvents the wheel for social distancing,76,jdgd4g,https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-hungary-ferriswheel/hungarian-restaurant-reinvents-the-wheel-for-social-distancing-idUSL8N2H9050,6,1603056603.0,,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hit by a plunge in turnover after foreign tourists vanished, Michelin-starred Hungarian restaurant Costes has staged a skyline dining event on the Budapest Eye ferris wheel to generate sales in a coronavirus-proof environment.

Costes owner Karoly Gerendai said that turnover at one of his reopened restaurants is down to about a tenth of pre-lockdown levels, forcing him to look for new ways to do business.

“Now that there are not many people either on the wheel or in the restaurant because there are no tourists, the opportunity arose that we could do this,” he said of the event at the landmark attraction in central Budapest.

“It is now especially important for people to be able to be separate from other guests to be safe, and the ferris wheel is ideal with its separate cabins.”

As of Sunday, Hungary had reported 46,290 COVID-19 cases with 1,142 deaths and the economy is heading towards a 5-7% contraction this year.

Tickets for the novel Costes dining experience cost up to 48,000 forints ($154.40) each for a four-course meal and sold out within days, Gerendai said, as affluent local clients sought a rare escape from the constraints of coronavirus restrictions.

Gerendai is planning to repeat the event when warmer weather arrives in the spring, though the cooler October night was no deterrent for customers on Saturday.

“We wanted to get out a bit and enjoy an experience again because we have been living quite closed in,” said Szabolcs Balazs, who took the meal with his wife and two children.

“We used to go to restaurants quite often; we have been to two Michelin-starred ones, but because of COVID we stopped going. So this is the only chance for us now because here we are really separated.”"

Divided world is failing COVID-19 test: U.N. Chief

Posted

A divided world has failed to rise to the challenge of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Saturday and warned concerted action was needed to prevent millions of people from being pushed into poverty and hunger."
"The Media Do Not Want You To Read, Share, or Discuss The New York Post's Hunter Biden Scoop",0,jd36hv,https://reason.com/2020/10/14/hunter-biden-new-york-post-story-media-facebook-burisma-ukraine/,7,1602997577.0,,"On Wednesday, the New York Post published an attention-catching original report: ""Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad."" In the previously unreleased email, which was allegedly sent on April 17, 2015, an executive with Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company, thanks Hunter Biden for ""giving an opportunity"" to meet Joe Biden, according to the New York Post.

It's a story that merits the attention of other journalists, political operatives, national security experts, and also the public at large—not least of all because there are serious questions about its accuracy, reliability, and sourcing. And yet many in the media are choosing not just to ignore the story, but to actively encourage others to suppress any discussion of it.

Indeed, two mainstream reporters who acknowledged (and criticized) the Post's scoop—The New York Times' Maggie Haberman and Politico's Jake Sherman—faced thunderous denunciation on Twitter from Democratic partisans simply for discussing the story. Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden accused Haberman of promoting disinformation, and New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg told Sherman that he was helping nefarious conservative activists ""launder this bullshit into the news cycle."" Historian Kevin Kruse asked why they were ""amplifying"" the story.

Note that both Haberman and Sherman raised serious questions about the veracity of the story, questions that certainly deserve answers. According to the New York Post, the email was obtained from the hard drive of a computer that may or may not have belonged to Hunter Biden. Someone allegedly gave the laptop to a computer repair store owner in Delaware in 2019. The FBI took possession of the laptop in December 2019, according to the New York Post—but not before the store owner copied the hard drive and sent it to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for President Donald Trump and a central figure in the Trump-Ukraine-Biden kerfuffle. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon then learned about the email and contacted the New York Post.

Giuliani and Bannon are political operatives with a long history of shady activity, so the fact that they were the intermediary sources for this story does raise red flags. But that doesn't mean the story is untrue. For what it's worth, the New York Post included photographs from the hard drive that allegedly confirms its authenticity. However, even if everything contained within the story turned out to be true, it still would not prove that the sought-after meeting with Joe Biden actually took place. A spokesperson for Biden said on Wednesday that according to Biden's schedule, he never met with the Burisma official.

This is the work of journalism—to ask questions, to probe, to find and share the truth. Haberman and Sherman were right to let their audiences know that the New York Post story exists, and they were right to challenge it. Many others in the media apparently believe the public cannot be trusted with such a challenging article. They have not merely shamed people for sharing it online, but also want to make it difficult for people to read the report at all.

Facebook Communications Director Andy Stone, a former Democratic staffer, announced that the social media platform would limit the article's distribution pending a fact-checker's review. He directed users to Facebook policy, which states that ""in many countries, including in the US, if we have signals that a piece of content is false, we temporarily reduce its distribution pending review by a third-party fact-checker.""

While Facebook is within its rights to take action against content it believes is factually misleading, this seems like a tough standard to enforce evenly. News articles in the mainstream press frequently contain information that is thinly or anonymously sourced, and sometimes proves to be inaccurate. It's one thing for social media platforms to take swift action against viral content that is very obviously false or incendiary, like conspiracy theories about coronavirus miracle cures or voter fraud. It's quite another for the platform to essentially make itself a gatekeeper of legitimate journalism, or a very selective media watchdog that appears to be more concerned about bad reporting when it comes from right-leaning outlets than left-leaning outlets, given the partisan leanings of social media company's internal policy setters.

The obvious result will be a double standard, and an unsustainable one: The right will claim (correctly) that social media companies are biased against questionable conservative content, while the left will claim (also correctly) that plenty of misinformation eludes the moderators. Of course, the oft-proposed solution to the problems with platform content curation is to reform or repeal Section 230, which immunizes online platforms from some lawsuits. This idea is popular with everybody from Trump and Biden to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R–Mo.), even though the obvious result of removing tech platform's liability protection would be even more aggressive moderation. New York Post op-ed editor Sohrab Ahmari tweeted that Facebook's handling of the Hunter Biden scoop makes the case for modifying Section 230, but without Section 230, Facebook would—for legal reasons—be even more reticent about letting users share unverified claims.

Such an outcome would be bad for a free and open society, for the same reason that it is wrong for the mainstream media to attempt to keep the public wholly ignorant of stories they would rather not tell. The information will get out, and it's better for journalists to contextualize—to add to our understanding—rather than pretend it doesn't exist.

In defending his decision to publish the Steele dossier, which contained unverified, dubious, and speculative information, then-BuzzFeed News Editor in Chief Ben Smith (now a media critic for The New York Times) wrote the following: ""You trust us to give you the full story; we trust you to reckon with a messy, sometimes uncertain reality."" That's a lesson the entire media should take to heart, and apply evenly, no matter the inconvenience of the narrative."
