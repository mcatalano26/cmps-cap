,"The political ideology of seeking to recover allegedly lost territories is called [Revanchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism) or [Irredentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irredentism).

The annexation of Crimea is ostensibly an instance of revanchism, but it could also be interpreted in cynical terms as being an expression of the Russian foreign policy goal of conquering [warm water ports](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/navy-base-syria-crimea-putin/408694/).

,"China is an interesting case that should be viewed in isolation due to its own specific fact pattern. China, while [mostly derivatives of Han Chinese](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/china_ethnic/statistics), does have a sizable number of other ethnicities, such as Tibetan and Uighur, concentrated in a few regions that have typically been restive and [rejective of the authority in Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_sovereignty_debate).

Allowing Taiwan to be independent indefinitely allows them to be a symbol and inspiration to those regions who want to be independent. 

The PRC is also facing the loss of the calming presence of the Dalai Lama in that he has [pressured down much of the violent resistance movement in Tibet.](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88460855) When he passes, China faces a very real threat of a very violent Tibetan independence movement.

 Xinjiang is already a restive hotbed to the point that [China is accused of running inhumane concentration camps to imprison, reeducate and otherwise pacify the region.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54277430)

Taiwan is just one aspect of the PRC trying to maintain cohesive control over the country in stamping down independence movements. It's why they've threatened invasion if Taiwan declares independence as it fears other regions will follow. Only now China actually has the means to make good on its threats. So I'd argue that China has a very strong ideological, political, and economical reason to favor forceful reunification as a means of preventing further breakup or independence movements.",Innovative_Wombat,,l5ibbb,gkuz5gg
,"I think that the most straightforward answer to your question is: nationalism – the belief that all members of a ‘nation’ (i.e. a People, usually understood as an ethnic group) should be members of the same sovereign state. (Best definition is in Ernest Gellner’s book ""Nations and Nationalism,"" but a tolerable summary of his ideas is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gellner%27s_theory_of_nationalism#:~:text=Gellner%20defined%20nationalism%20as%20%22primarily,the%20totality%2C%20of%20the%20population) or [here](https://nationalismstudies.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/ernest-gellner-2/).)

Both Russian [claims in Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/29/russian-nationalism-kremlin-actions-ukraine) and Chinese [claims](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538) to [Taiwan](https://thediplomat.com/2020/12/has-taiwan-always-been-part-of-china/) are typically framed in terms of national reunification. (If you're really into it, Chris Hughes book [Taiwan and Chinese Nationalism](https://www.routledge.com/Taiwan-and-Chinese-Nationalism-National-Identity-and-Status-in-International/Hughes/p/book/9781138863026) is older, but the definitive work on the question). Swedish speakers in Finland would not be considered nationalist because, to my knowledge, there is no significant drive to rejoin a Swedish state.

Whether or not this is the really motivating ideology for the leaders of Russia or China is a much thornier question. The forceful expansion of territory, or ‘right of conquest’, is against contemporary [international law](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24716&LangID=E#:~:text=%E2%80%9CInternational%20law%20is%20very%20clear,Palestinian%20territory%20occupied%20since%201967.) and norms. The international response to the Iraq’s [invasion of Kuwait](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/1/thirty-years-on-iraqs-invasion-of-kuwait-still-haunts-region) is generally considered a prime example of this principle put into practice.

The right to [‘national self-determination’](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/national-self-determination), however, is also a key norm in the modern international system, intended as a remedy to (predominantly European) imperialism following the World Wars. So if a country wants to expand its territory for strategic or economic reasons, say as a buffer against [NATO expansion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-putin-nato-idUSBREA3G22A20140417), or to secure its [maritime interests in the South China Sea](https://thediplomat.com/2015/05/taiwan-and-strategic-security/), it is a lot easier to get away with it if they call it an act of national reunification based on some historical claims. Whether or not particular historical claims are valid, or even relevant any more, is a whole other can of worms.

Why are some countries more inclined towards reunification, or to back up those claims with military force? While a lot of that is particular to individual countries (style of government, access to resources, nearby allies or rivals, domestic unrest, etc.), part of it comes down to the fact that modern borders were largely imposed on the rest of the world by European empires and (post WWII) America. China - and to a lesser extent Russia - did not get a say in how post-colonial territories were divided up in the first place, so they feel justified in challenging those borders now. This was not the case in Sweden, for example. However, if you consider the vigorous (and sometimes very violent) nationalist movements in [Northern Ireland](https://www.britannica.com/event/The-Troubles-Northern-Ireland-history), [Catalonia](https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2019/05/08/the-emergence-and-growth-of-catalan-nationalism), or the [former Yugoslavia](https://www.e-ir.info/2011/02/28/was-nationalism-the-primary-cause-of-the-wars-in-the-former-yugoslavia/), you see very similar ideological resistance to the ‘status quo’ borders, just coming from stateless actors rather than state actors.",BookOfTea,,l5ibbb,gkv62u3
,"I’m gonna try and explain this in layman terms and unbiased.

I think what you’re taking about is Nationalism and Imperialist parties. [Nationalism usually looks at the nation as having lost it’s standing and looks to bolster it’s ‘strength.’](https://www.tutorhunt.com/resource/5308/) It is also economically fastest to rapidly grow wealth is by dictating who can and can’t participate in the economy and by increasing access to more wealth and resources. I am trying to find this paper so please believe me I guess. It evaluated the cities that had high rates of death during the spanish flu and the increase in socioeconomic mobility. Basically removing people through wars and pandemics increase economic mobility in high function economies. Unfortunately, we are getting into a paper that I wrote and can’t link this nor the sources because they are behind the schools pay wall.

Expanding access to wealth

In regards to acquisition of land an example would be the history of England and their colonies. The second oldest son would go out to the colonies and by being the socioeconomic ruling class they were able to generate wealth and then come back and participate in the economy just like their fathers and eldest brothers do. However, if you take that away they can’t participate in the elite economy. These colonies increase the access to wealth. This idea of wealth generation is the reason why imperialism is so alluring.

Changing economic ruling class

An easy example is literally disbarring people who have wealth from participating in the elite or top levels of the economy and then new people take that spot. Think about the development of communist countries, French Revolution, even Nazi Germany removing the rich Jews and giving that wealth to ‘citizens’ creates fast growth in wealth for the people that the government considers citizens.

So for unification reason it’s typically not, [this is a link to a PowerPoint because it displays the info perfectly,](http://www.clovis-schools.org/chs-freshman/Resources/PowerPoints/Hawaii.ppt) about the citizens there. Its about access to resources so that you can increase the access to resources which leads to wealth generation.

Theres also different styles of imperialism [The west is known for its imperialism in the Middle East .](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/history/influences-of-western-imperialism-in-the-middle-east-history-essay.php) Even the [US War on Terror is considered imperialist policies.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40278314?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents) wars are a great way for wealth generation through government contracts, greater death rates increase the rate of wealth mobility, and there is ideas that after the wars, the US can influence the economies of those countries.

As for whether this is solely a west or east argument look currently at the areas that are trying to stop the separation. One could make the argument that forceful acquisition is no different than forceful holding of areas already owned. [The troubles, ](https://www.britannica.com/event/The-Troubles-Northern-Ireland-history) [Scottish independence,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-24/sturgeon-seeks-legal-independence-vote-as-party-sets-out-plan)[Catalonia’s independence,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/how-catalonias-push-independence-has-scrambled-spanish-politics/) [Pacific island dependent on United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pacific-Islands/Independence-movements), [and other European independence movements.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/oct/27/beyond-catalonia-pro-independence-movements-in-europe-map)

I would say that nationalist political parties whether left or right are going to call for the most unification of the country. It just depends at how they will decide what is or is not part of the ‘country.’

,"In both of your examples you have countries with a longstanding historical claim to a territory, followed by recent split, followed by a recent (successful or in progress) reunification. Additionally in both cases, the legitimacy of the pre-unification territorial claims are dubious.

Crimea was [part of Russia starting before the US existed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1768%E2%80%931774). Under the USSR Crimea was redesignated as part of the Ukrainian province for economic reasons. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, [Crimea held a referendum with 94% supporting independence from Ukraine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Crimean_sovereignty_referendum). Despite this, in 1994 Yeltsins Russia and NATO agreed to Ukraines sovereignty over Crimea.

In 2014 during the Ukrainian civil war, Russia retook Crimea from Ukraine.  [Another referendum was held](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_status_referendum) once again showing strong (97%) opposition to subordination to Ukraine and support for reintegration into Russia.

In the case of Russias annexation of Crimea, there was a democratic mandate, precedent, and helpful political conditions (civil war) supporting Crimean reintegration into Russia. Ideologies that support forceful reunifications are ubiquitous. However, opportune political conditions and a democratic mandate are rare, but present in this instance.

Taiwan is different in that there isnt a democratic mandate for unification. A recent opinion poll showed [54% support for independence compared to 13% support for unification](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/06/23/2003738708).

Strangely enough, both RoC and PRC claim [nearly the same exact territory](https://historum.com/threads/territorial-claims-of-the-roc.75913/) and both consider the others de facto territories as de jure illegitimate. These legal territorial claims have remained in place since the Chinese Communist Revolution.

Following PRCs recognition by the UN in the 70s, Taiwan has been left without international legitemacy. [Not even the US has a formal relationship with Taiwans government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Relations_Act).

In other words, this is an example of geopolitcal conditions presenting an opportunity to assert existing territorial claims militarily.

The filibuster is, in principle, a threat to engage in open-ended debate long enough to prevent some action. In practice, that's very rare nowadays, but the threat alone has the same power, since no one wants to deal with a filibuster from either side. In effect, that means that many controversial Senate actions require 60 votes.

,"Trump campaigned on cutting taxes across the board, but more specifically focusing on [cutting taxes for ""middle and lower-income classes""](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/28/donald-trump-unveils-tax-plan). He also said that it would ""eliminate federal taxes for 31 million households"", and said that ""It [will] eliminate the loopholes available to the very rich.""

The tax cut bill was passed less than a year into the Trump presidency with the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017), however it is not without [many criticisms.](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2020/10/28/492473/6-ways-trump-administration-rigging-already-unfair-tax-code/)


[An alleged 60% of the tax savings went to those in the top 20%](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/20/789540931/2-years-later-trump-tax-cuts-have-failed-to-deliver-on-gops-promises) and helped[billionaires pay less than the working class](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/09/trump-tax-cuts-helped-billionaires-pay-less) for the first time in history. U.S. workers were also promised an ""[average annual wage increases of $4,000 or more](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2019/09/26/475083/trumps-corporate-tax-cut-not-trickling/)"" due to less of their money going to paying taxes, however [studies have come out since then](https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/trumps-tax-cuts/the-secret-saga-of-trumps-tax-cuts) stating the growth to workers wage have been neglible [with an average of around a $500 increase](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/chartbook-trump-gop-tax-cuts-failing-workers-economy/). Additionally, the growth rate of wages [was only 0.4%](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-01-01/donald-trump-tax-cut-deficit) which is far less than the 0.7% that the last two years of the Obama admin experienced. And while it is true that worker bonuses went up after the passing of the tax cut, [the value of the bonuses](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/post-tcja-bonuses-were-mostly-timing-shift-not-boost-long-term-worker-pay) are now below what they were pre-tax cut. The overall benefit of the tax cuts [were for the rich](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tax-plan-consequences/)

The cuts to corporation taxes were initially promised to be a drop from 35% to 15%, however [it ended up being 21%](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2019/09/26/475083/trumps-corporate-tax-cut-not-trickling/) These gains to cashflow were rarely directed towards increasing capital expenditure/research and development (only 20%), while 80% [went to investors through things such as dividends and buybacks](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/05/31/U-S-46942), and between 2017 and 2019, overall business investment [""slowed, and then went into the negative""](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2019/09/26/475083/trumps-corporate-tax-cut-not-trickling/). The promise that the tax cuts would [benefit small businesses](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/mnuchin-gop-tax-plan-gives-small-business-lowest-rates-since-1930s.html) also seems like a stretch, noting that [only 25% of the benefits](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-01-01/donald-trump-tax-cut-deficit) went to small <$200k businesses.

The tax cuts also promised to be a boon the U.S. economy, with then Majority leader Mitch McConnell saying ""After eight straight years of slow growth and underperformance, America is ready to take off"". However, a year after the tax cuts were signed into law, the U.S. economy grew at the same rate as it did in [2015 under Obama](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/28/698884578/u-s-economy-grew-2-9-percent-in-2018-just-below-trumps-target). However, it is important to note that the stock market and unemployment was [also at historic highs and lows, respectively](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/06/785334356/job-market-surges-as-employers-add-266-000-jobs-in-november)

Trump also promised that these tax cuts would allow U.S. businesses ""trapped overseas by previous tax systems"" to return and invest in the U.S again. [This didn't seem to happen](https://tax.unc.edu/index.php/publication/the-effect-of-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-of-2017-on-multinational-firms-capital-investment-internal-capital-market-frictions-and-tax-incentives/) as the report states that the tax cut law creates more investment overseas than in the U.S.

Finally, the claim that the law would eliminate loopholes available for the very rich seemed to be neglible at most. [the law seemed to have added more loopholes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/business/trump-tax-cuts-beat-gilti.html) that the upper classes would benefit most from, with many loopholes granted for large corporations to pay less taxes after it was worried there would be a ""business revolt"".

An additional note; the effect of the tax cuts may not also add into the effect of the Trump administration's cut to [welfare programs](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/cuts-to-low-income-assistance-programs-in-president-trumps-2020-budget-are) which heavily affect lower income taxes.

However, it is very important to note that whilst many reports and evidence has come out both in favour and against the effects of Trump's tax cuts - which for all intents and purposes, he has successfully implemented - it will take many more years for the effects of the tax cut to come to fruition, and the tax cuts will mostly return to normal [over the next 4 years as the cuts are set to expire without congressional votes for extensions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/are-taxes-are-going-up-next-year.html).",Totes_Police,,l2zp5q,gk9bdvo

It may not be perfect, but it was a good first step in the right direction.",TiredOfRoad,,l2zp5q,gkas9pc
,"##Foreign policy (part 1 of 2)

President Trump took an [unconventional approach to foreign policy](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-s-foreign-policy-pure-trump-it-s-working-him-n815636) and it was arguably the most successful realm of his administration. Even though he oversaw a [serious decline in American credibility](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/09/15/us-image-plummets-internationally-as-most-say-country-has-handled-coronavirus-badly/) with respect to its traditional allies and the world, there were some notable achievements on long-standing issues.

**China.**

China has been a [thorn in the side of US administrations for the last 30 years,](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/why-has-china-become-such-a-big-political-issue/) because they're a huge and growing economy, big trading partner, and great power competitor, but also seen by many as a bad faith participant on the global stage. Upon entering the WTO, they [employed currency manipulation](https://world101.cfr.org/global-era-issues/trade/what-happened-when-china-joined-wto) to keep the price of their exported goods low on the world market, engaged in widespread [theft of intellectual property](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/07/china-intellectual-property-theft-counting-costs-united-states/) abroad, pursued a [policy of territorial expansion,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-dash_line) and [militarized islands](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/19/chinas-south-china-sea-militarization-has-peaked/) in the South China Sea after explicitly [promising not to.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-completes-runway-on-artificial-island-in-south-china-sea-1443184818)

Previous administrations had worried about overstepping with the Chinese for fear that Americans had become too accustomed to cheap Chinese imports and would disapprove of the resulting inflation from the US imposing sanctions or tariffs on China. The Trump administration [took those actions anyway](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/11/what-trumps-tariffs-on-china-are-and-how-they-work.html) and there [wasn't significant inflation.](https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/images/charts/Annual_Inflation/Annual_Inflation_2008-2019-Aug.png)

It is true that the Chinese [retaliated with respect to their US imports](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/china-to-retaliate-with-new-tariffs-on-another-75-billion-worth-of-us-goods.html) and it's also true that the tariffs [did not spark much of a ""reshoring"" initiative,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwolcott/2020/05/18/china-america-reshoring-manufacturing-and-resilience-america-play-the-long-game/?sh=4fb884154905) even when combined with the 2017 tax incentives. So, the Trump approach cannot be considered an unequivocal success. But it does show that the fears of the consequences for [getting tough with China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war) were overblown and that future administrations can try to enforce fair trade without as much concern as prior administrations did. Democrats and Republicans alike have praised Trump's approach to China and even Biden's designee for Secretary of State says [getting tough was the right approach.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-state-china-idUSKBN29O2GB)

**Israel.**

[Arab-Israeli relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict) have been problematic since the formation of the Israeli state in 1948. As the United States' most staunch ally in the region, Israel's relations with its neighbors has been a keen concern of every administration since then, yet the only one to make any substantial progress before Trump was Jimmy Carter, who helped negotiate and oversee [Egypt's peace treaty with Israel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords)

The Trump Administration helped negotiate and oversee the normalization of Israel's relations with [Bahrain, the UAE,](https://www.state.gov/the-abraham-accords/) [Sudan,](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-bahrain-israel-united-arab-emirates-sudan-07fe32a9ac1bd3afe5c503d4ff6bc859) and [Morocco.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/12/14/moroccos-partial-normalization-with-israel-comes-with-risks-and-gains/)

Previous US administrations had approached this issue through the standard diplomatic tactic of sitting down with the parties, trying to agree on a framework of discussion, and then, little by little, extracting concessions from each side, being careful not to appear to favor any one. The Trump administration took an [entirely different approach.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-plan-idUSKBN1ZR1SR) They said, essentially, ""We're taking Israel's side and here's what we're willing to offer; take it or be left out."" Surprisingly, that novel approach seems to have worked, at least on the level of normalizing relations with Arab countries. The Palestinians, unfortunately, are getting left out in the cold, at least for now. Time will tell if these normalized relations will end up benefitting the Palestinians in the long run.

**Afghanistan.**

At nearly 20 years old, the [Afghanistan war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)) is now the [longest in US history.](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/afghanistan-longest-war-american-history) Many of the American soldiers serving there [were not even born when it started.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2018/09/12/afghanistan-war-has-gone-so-long-people-born-after-sept-can-now-enlist/) As is always the case with Afghanistan, getting in is far easier than getting out. They don't call it [the graveyard of empires](https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/why-is-afghanistan-the-graveyard-of-empires/) for nothing.

The Trump Administration consistently pursued a strategy of [drawing down US forces](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-troops-afghanistan-now-down-162524497.html) there and negotiating with the Taliban. Those negotiations have [resulted in an agreement](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-taliban-peace-deal-agreement-afghanistan-war) being signed and US forces there are now significantly less than they were when Trump took office.

The question for many people is whether these actions will actually lead to a more secure Afghanistan or whether they hurt that prospect by essentially sidelining the central government and leaving them without sufficient military support. The Taliban now control up to 40% of territory in the country and [violent attacks are a nearly daily occurrence.](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/01/12/as-taliban-attacks-spike-in-afghanistan-a-test-for-withdrawal-and-peace/)

But in my view, unless the US is willing to do [what it did in Germany and Japan](https://www.theglobalist.com/germany-and-japan-a-comeback-story/) after World War II — which is basically invest a bunch of capital and send a huge occupying force that stays there for a generation while the culture shifts — the rise of the Taliban is inevitable. Leaving handfuls of troops is just delaying the inevitable. The Taliban is going to end up being the Afghans' problem sooner or later anyway, and if they can't deal with it after 20 years of US and international help, it's hard to see how another year or two is going to change that.

**North Korea.**

This one is a mixed bag. North Korea has consistently increased its militarization and bellicose statements through the last five US administrations, including Trump's. But there were talks, meetings, moderate progress, and a reduction of missile testing in the last four years. Trump's unconventional approach may yet pay dividends. We'll have to see.

**No new wars.**

Trump [promised a non-interventionist policy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-military/trump-lays-out-non-interventionist-u-s-military-policy-idUSKBN13W06L) right from the start and he essentially delivered on that. His is one of only four administrations since World War II [to engage in no new military conflicts,](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/01/fact-check-trump-not-first-president-since-eisenhower-without-new-war/6086636002/) but they all come with caveats:

* Nixon didn't start the Vietnam War, but he had an active hand in prolonging it by [sabotaging 1968 peace talks while he was running for president](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/yes-nixon-scuttled-the-vietnam-peace-talks-107623) and then [expanding the war into Laos and Cambodia](https://study.com/academy/lesson/cambodia-and-laos-impact-of-major-operations-under-nixon.html) during his presidency.
* Ford didn't start engage in any new conflicts, but also [served a shortened term.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Gerald_Ford)
* Carter didn't start any new conflicts, but did order the [failed military operation to rescue the Iranian hostages.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw) Carter is fond of [saying his administration never fired a shot,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/11/president-jimmy-carter-interview) but it wasn't for lack of trying.
* Trump didn't start any new wars, but did order the [assassination of Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) who the administration claimed was responsible for past and imminent attacks on US forces. (Note that just a few years prior, US forces had actually [worked with Soleimani](https://www.ozy.com/true-and-stories/not-so-long-ago-soleimani-and-the-u-s-worked-together-to-beat-isis/262477/) in their efforts to eradicate the Islamic State from Iraq.)",nosecohn,,l2zp5q,gk9jt2f

,"**Economy**

I’m not very savvy with economics but I’ve never understood the very boisterous claims of economic success under Trump.  From what I see, most economic trends began before Trump - the only thing he did is add to the debt...

U6 unemployment - same downward trend since 2011

[https://www.macrotrends.net/1377/u6-unemployment-rate](https://www.macrotrends.net/1377/u6-unemployment-rate)

(even African American unemployment - something Trump bragged about a lot - seems to just follow a pre-existing trend)

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=AhWL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=AhWL)

Hourly earning - the same trend ( tho upward in this case) from pre-Obama, thru Trump

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES0500000003](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES0500000003)

But… the deficit trend since the peak of the 2008 financial crisis was doing great… for the last few years of Obama it was going down every year... until Trump comes along (I'm referring to pre COVID)

[https://datalab.usaspending.gov/americas-finance-guide/deficit/trends/](https://datalab.usaspending.gov/americas-finance-guide/deficit/trends/)

This seems especially noteworthy when you consider the degree to which the Republicans freaked out over debt under Obama.  

It seems like the impact to workers under Trump was unchanged (same continued improvements that began before Trump) - but we went 1 - 2 trillion dollars more in the hole than we were headed before Trump.  Had Trump done nothing (if we extrapolate the charts from when Obama left office) we’d have the same job improvements but close to a balanced budget.  Again - I'm not great with economics so willing to be shown that I'm wrong.

A new report from the Cato Institute - [an American libertarian think tank founded as the Charles Koch Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute) (so, you know, not a bunch of goddam liberal hippies) - suggests some mixed results. 

> [***President Trump Reduced Legal Immigration. He Did Not Reduce Illegal Immigration***](https://www.cato.org/blog/president-trump-reduced-legal-immigration-he-did-not-reduce-illegal-immigration) 

> President Trump entered the White House with the goal of reducing legal immigration by 63 percent. Trump was wildly successful in reducing legal immigration. By November 2020, the Trump administration reduced the number of green cards issued to people abroad by at least 418,453 and the number of non‐​immigrant visas by at least 11,178,668 during his first term through November 2020. President Trump also entered the White House with the goal of eliminating illegal immigration but Trump oversaw a virtual collapse in interior immigration enforcement and the stabilization of the illegal immigrant population. Thus, Trump succeeded in reduce legal immigration and failed to eliminate illegal immigration.

...

> Although Trump succeeded in cutting legal immigration more than he initially planned, he oversaw the collapse of interior immigration enforcement. In 2020, the removal of illegal immigrants from the interior of the United States was the lowest as an absolute number and as a share of the illegal immigration population since ICE was created in 2003 (Figure 3). Trump failed to increase removals because local jurisdictions refused to cooperate with his administration, continuing a trend begun during the Obama administration in response to their deportation efforts. As a result, the population of illegal immigrants remained about the same as when he took office (Figure 4).",SFepicure,,l2zp5q,gknig93
,"# US-China Trade War

> [US President Donald Trump famously tweeted that ""trade wars were good, and easy to win"" in 2018 as he began to impose tariffs on about US$360 billion of imports from China. It turns out he was wrong on both counts.](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/how-china-won-trumps-trade-war-and-got-americans-to-foot-the-bill)

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-jobs/us-china-trade-war-has-cost-up-to-245000-us-jobs-business-group-study-idUSKBN29J2O9),

> U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war with China has caused a peak loss of 245,000 U.S. jobs, but a gradual scaling back of tariffs on both sides would boost growth and lead to an additional 145,000 jobs by 2025, a study commissioned by the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) shows.

> The group, which represents major American companies doing business in China, said the study by Oxford Economics also includes an “escalation scenario” which estimates a significant decoupling of the world’s two largest economies could shrink U.S. GDP by $1.6 trillion over the next five years. This could result in 732,000 fewer U.S. jobs in 2022 and 320,000 fewer jobs by 2025, it said.

&nbsp;

[Bloomberg](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/how-china-won-trumps-trade-war-and-got-americans-to-foot-the-bill),

> **The US trade deficit grew**

> Mr Trump vowed in his 2016 election year to very quickly ""start reversing"" the US goods trade deficit with China, ignoring mainstream economists who downplay the importance of bilateral deficits. However, the deficit with China had increased since then, hitting US$287 billion (S$381 billion) in the 11 months to November last year, according to Chinese data.

...

> **China's export machine rolls on**

> Mr Trump repeatedly said that China's accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001 caused its economy to take off like a ""rocket ship"", a result he viewed as unfair. As it turned out, Mr Trump's trade war with China coincided with another expansion in Chinese exports. After shrinking for two straight years in 2015 and 2016, China's total shipments grew each year after Mr Trump took office, including in 2019 when exports to the US fell.

...

> **US companies stay in China**

> Mr Trump said that tariffs would encourage US manufacturers to move production back home and in a 2019 tweet, he ""ordered"" them to ""immediately start looking for an alternative to China"". But there is little evidence of any such shift taking place.

> US direct investment into China increased slightly from US$12.9 billion in 2016 to US$13.3 billion in 2019, according to Rhodium Group data.

...

> **Economic losses on both sides**

> Mr Trump claimed that tariffs had boosted the US economy, while causing China's economy to have its ""worst year in over 50"" in 2019. However, direct economic impacts were small relative to the size of the two countries' economies as the value of exports between them is tiny relative to gross domestic product (GDP).

> China grew at or above 6 per cent in both 2018 and 2019, with tariffs costing it about 0.3 per cent of GDP over those years, according to economist Yang Zhou of the University of Minnesota. By her estimate, the trade war cost the US 0.08 per cent of GDP over the same period. The clearest winner was Vietnam, where the tariffs boosted GDP by nearly 0.2 percentage point as companies relocated.

...


> **US consumer foots the bill**

> Mr Trump repeatedly claimed that China was paying for the tariffs. Economists who crunched the numbers were surprised to find that Chinese exporters generally did not lower prices to keep their goods competitive after the tariffs were imposed. That meant US duties were mostly paid by its own companies and consumers.

> The tariffs led to an income loss for US consumers of about US$16.8 billion annually in 2018, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research paper.

> Another own goal: Tariffs on imports from China tended to reduce US exports. That was because globalised supply chains mean manufacturing is shared between countries, and the US raised the costs of its own goods by levying duties on imports of Chinese components.

> Companies that together account for 80 per cent of US exports had to pay higher prices for Chinese imports, according to analysis of confidential company data by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the US Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve, reducing export growth.

...

> **The Rust Belt stayed rusty**

> Mr Trump campaigned hard back in 2016 on pledges to revive the Rust Belt by taking on China and bringing the jobs back home. It did not happen.

> Growth in US manufacturing jobs flatlined in 2019, partly due to falling exports. Even regions home to industries such as steel, which received explicit protection from Mr Trump's tariffs, saw declines in employment, according to research by New York University Stern School of Business economist Michael Waugh, suggesting that the trade war did not significantly alter the trajectory of US manufacturing.

...

> **China changed at its own pace**

> The Trump administration claimed that tariffs provided leverage over the Chinese, which would force them to make reforms to benefit US companies. ""I love properly put-on tariffs, because they bring unfair competitors from foreign countries to do whatever you want them to do,"" Mr Trump said.

> The biggest victory claimed by the administration as part of its trade deal were promises from Beijing to enhance intellectual property (IP) protections. But that was probably in China's interests anyway.",SFepicure,,l2zp5q,gkh6wxs

Trade was a highlight, attempting to spur domestic manufacturing.

**Environment**

Largely considered pretty poor on account of cutting back regulations. On some level, some of the signatories the Paris Climate Accords [were deliberately circumventing it to produce more fossil fuel plants.](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/climate-change/china-is-erasing-the-paris-climate-accord/) This was the impetus for the withdrawal, however, no great initiatives were launched to replace it, nor were overhauls demanded. One new major regulation was put on ships regarding the burning of bunker fuel.

**Foreign policy**

A mixture. Repealing the Iranian deal, meeting with N. Korean leadership, and more firsts. Making strides to come closer with some countries such as Taiwan and Japan, while also driving foreign relations apart. Didn't launch any new major wars, which is a departure from the previous few administrations.

**Healthcare**

Did not repeal the ACA. Attempts were made, but little of major consequence occurred despite all. ""Right to Try"" passed to allow pharmaceutical companies to run trials for willing terminal patients. 

**Immigration**

Did not build the cages, but also didn't break the cages, either. 

**Rule of law**

A tumultuous summer in America in which fires were lit, buildings and public property destroyed, and the Capitol stormed, the notion of 'Rule of Law' seems to have fallen apart. [Faith in the American Justice System has been low for a couple decades,](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/189106-1.pdf) but it has become increasingly politicised, [with DA offices being bought outright.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/aug/20/george-soros-funded-das-oversee-big-cities-skyrock/) An overall lack of faith in the authorities, from doubting the head of the FDA and WHO, to a citizens' lack of faith that criminals would be charged by a politicized DA office and the attempts to not prosecute minor crimes in states like California, to citizens concerned they would be provided for in the event of a lockdown barring them from working their normal jobs, to the growth of Sovereign Citizen movement, has meant Rule of Law is falling apart.

**Public safety**

Coronavirus has made it dangerous to go outside. The cases of COVID were not tracked properly due to inaccurately returned results for COVID, making contact tracing appear at first to be effective, but revealed only past the point of effective containment procedures.

**Taxes**

Largely benefitted the top half of the country in allowances and cuts.

**Tone of political discourse**

Degraded, but also more honest. If one relied on the media for analysis, they got a very different story to reality, which itself was very different to what the President often said. For once, everyone lied, and no one seemed to really care. 

**Trade**

Trade wars, trade re-negotiations. It shined an interesting limelight on the conditions of the free market- market forces shift, but free trade agreements often don't come with an expiry date. It was worth wondering whether that was wise. Many tariffs got re-negotiated, some were put in place to push for domestic manufacturing. The inherent quality of trade became questionable as we saw masks disappear from within our own borders for foreign nations, while our own hospitals and first responders ran out of PPE as an element of trade.

**Appointments**

Success beyond all expectation (from the GOP). [Obama was warned he'd regret changing nominations to 49/51 majority, and this allowed the Republicans to do what they've needed to in order to keep up with the increasingly politicised federal judiciary branch (exempting SCOTUS, which was changed to majority later).](https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/191057-mcconnell-youll-regret-this) By ""securing"" the SCOTUS in This hands the SCOTUS into conservative hands for the near future, and it has had a 'big payoff,' for the GOP. I'll add that the candidates largely seemed generally uncontroversial on professional grounds. In this, I mark it as a ""success"" (for the GOP.)  In terms of cabinet, despite being largely considered unqualified, the DoE was headed by someone who performed a mixture of motions, almost all of them largely in-line with conservative values. Title IX was scaled back to its original scope of equal sexual rights and harassment, and removed administrators from their roles as judges in sexual assault cases, charter schools (private and public alike) were promoted and protected from the axe, carving away at enrolment in traditional public schools. Ajit Pai of the FCC struck down net neutrality. The head of the EPA was largely seen as in the pocket of corporations. Federal Reserve Chairman printed US Dollars and propped up Wall Street from its massive losses.",EndTimesRadio,,l2zp5q,gkee26k

,"This is a really, really weird question to read because on surface, we know what you’re talking about. But if we drill down the wording in attempt to answer your question properly, it gets awkward.

By my understanding, definition of a protest in this context is a group of people gathering to express an objection, and a rally means a group of people gathering to express an objection(or support).

So reading “protest rally”, while to those who’s been keeping track, is conceptually understanding what you mean but it still reads like a word repeated or an oxymoron depending on how you view the nature of the rally prior to the insurrection. But either way, I’m context we understand it’s a group of people who are ultimately protesting(verb) against something. Or rallying in support of the president who’s issuing a protest(noun). 

But, to attempt to answer your question:

From my understanding: The nature of the US President being on the very top of the federal government means that if there’s anything he doesn’t like, he can do *something* about it. If he can’t, it’s none of his business. Therefore, a protest(verb) which is for people not in power to express their opinions, are by nature speaking out against the president if he’s involved in one.

It is possible for the president to see things he doesn’t like. But again, being on the top of the federal food chain means he can just take the issue directly to the people in charge. It’s like seeing a company’s CEO participating in a worker’s strike for better wages. He can either make the change himself, or bring it up to the board if they can’t.

Past US presidents have had varying approaches to mass protests and activism. Some were reluctant to bring up their causes, but were eventually pushed by politics. Others ignored calls from the masses or charged them with unruly behavior. Others brought them into the White House for discussions.

President John F. Kennedy delivered an [Oval Office address](https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/historic-speeches/televised-address-to-the-nation-on-civil-rights) on June 11, 1963, proposing anti-discrimination and anti-segregation legislation.

That address, according to the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, happened ""only after the effective and public grassroots movement brought international attention to the violence and undemocratic reality of segregation and forced him to take a stand.""

In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech and march on Washington was credited with bolstering support for Kennedy's proposed civil rights legislation. The day of the march, Kennedy met with civil rights leaders in the Oval Office.

President Lyndon B. Johnson made civil rights a main tenet of his Great Society agenda after Kennedy's death, which propelled the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through Congress.

In the wake of riots across the country over King's assassination, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968 into law. The legislation also made certain actions relating to inciting a riot a felony under federal law.

,"The one that comes to mind would be the ""Brooks Brothers riot"" in 2000 to protest the counting of votes in Florida during that presidential election.

I'm going off the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Brothers_riot) for it (apologies if that's not allowed), but there are sources for the salient points.

It's [alleged](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/02/the-dirty-trickster) to have been organized by Roger Stone (hired by James Baker, chief legal advisor for three Bush campaign), and led by Matt Schlapp. There seems to be some controversy in that (like much with Stone), but the other claimants also worked for the campaign).

* The [May Day Riots of 1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day_riots_of_1919) might fit, but seem too early to clearly associate it with the campaign.

,"Simply put, this order does not reach that question. The policy section of executive orders (as you note) is designed to provide context and motivation for the subsequent enforceable provisions. In this case, the enforceable provisions are all related to executive branch agencies analyzing actions taken under the previous administration that may have discriminated on the basis of sex or gender identity.

A good rule of thumb (reinforced by this helpful [website](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/what-is-an-executive-order-/)) is that executive orders are restricted to executive branch agencies in impact. The president, as head of the executive branch, may alter the functions of executive agencies in limited ways. That is precisely what is being done in this instance. This executive order is an administrative action and would not apply in the hypothetical you described.

Via executive order, the Department of Education may be able to withhold funding to states that, say, do not allow transgender students to participate in their preferred sport. *This EO does not do that.* It is a backward-looking review of federal actions with some provisions against future discrimination by federal agencies.

,"> would this Executive Order give a transgender person legal ground to challenge a decision made by a public school to prevent them from joining a school-sponsored team of their stated gender?

Didn't they already have that legal ground under [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity_under_Title_IX)? And/or the [Equal Protection Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause)? There's some history there:

* The Obama administration (as put forward in a 2010 letter and clarified in 2014 and 2016) interpreted Title IX as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity and enforced it accordingly.
* The Trump administration (in 2017 and 2018) withdrew that interpretation and specified that Title IX does not allow students to use bathrooms that match their gender identities. A later memo proposed a strict definition of birth sex that would exclude transgender students from recognition altogether, but after some protests that policy was not enacted.
* In 2016 the Seventh Circuit ruled that a transgender boy in Wisconsin must be allowed to use the boys' bathroom at school because of Title IX.
* In 2016 the Fourth Circuit granted a preliminary injunction allowing a transgender boy in Virginia to use the boys' bathroom at school, in part because of the Obama administration's guidance letter, but in 2017 the Supreme Court allowed the case to be reheard because of the Trump administration's withdrawal of that guidance. The district court still ruled with the boy, this time citing the Equal Protection Clause as well as Title IX, but on appeal... (to be continued)
* In 2018, after a switcheroo in which cisgender students sued to end a school district's policy allowing transgender students to use either restroom, the Third Circuit ruled that the policy did not violate the rights of the cisgender students and was constitutional.
* In 2020, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that a transgender boy in Florida must be allowed to use the boys' bathroom at school because both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity.
* In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in [*Bostock v. Clayton County*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County) that [Title VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_VII%E2%80%94equal_employment_opportunity) prohibits discrimination against employees (not students, but stay with me) on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.
* ...Returning to the Virginia case, the Fourth Circuit cited *Bostock* and inferred that Title IX therefore also prohibits discrimination against students on the basis of gender identity, thus reaffirming the boy's right to use the boys' bathroom.

(summarized from Wikipedia and its sources; please add detail or corrections)

So even though the Supreme Court hasn't directly ruled on gender identity and Title IX, every federal appeals court that's considered the matter has concluded that Title IX protects transgender students. And that was despite the Trump administration's explicit interpretation to the contrary. Even though transgender students may still need to take their schools to court to assert their rights, it seems very likely the courts will continue to take their side with or without an executive order in their favor.",Epistaxis,,l27qc3,gk4ugwl
,"I think it remains to be seen.  At first glance, it appears state law will supersede this Executive Order.  

In an article about Montana passing a law that would contradict the EO: ""The administration concludes that under the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Bostock v. Clayton County, Title IX of the Education Amendments also prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, “so long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.” [(1)](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/535274-after-biden-reestablishes-transgender-protections)",grimli333,,l27qc3,gk4gnnj
,"Yes, and to explain why, I should explain the background.

It ultimately comes down to federal interpretation of [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX) of the Education Acts of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any scholastic activity that receives federal funding. This was passed years ago in responce to what used to be very routine sex discrimination especially in school sports, which would likely surprise many people here today. For example, it used to be quite common for women to be barred from college gyms, even if they were federal funded, because schools just found it inconvenient to accommodate them and didn't see the point, figuring that sports were mainly a male thing anyway.

The question comes down to defining the word ""sex"" for this particular law. While it's probably obvious that few or none of those involved in the original legislation thought it should include gender minorities, that does not prevent more recent government from making that interpretation.

(For anyone who considers that stupid or outrageous, consider that the law protecting your laptop or phone from unwarranted government intrusion was written in 1789. While legal philosophers may differ, it's generally broadly accepted in American jurisprudence that the underlying principles of a given law should inform its interpretation over time. The fact that you no longer store your private documents on parchment in a physical lockbox does not prevent the Fourth Amendment from protecting them from unwarranted government search and seizure.)

The Obama administration interpreted Title IX in a modern context, to include gender minorities, and implemented a federal policy to enforce it on that basis. The Trump administration disagreed, and reversed that. Biden's EO effectively reverses that reversal, though more narrowly. However, it almost certainly augurs an imminent return to the Obama-era interpretation and enforcement of Title IX. And this time, that's backed up indirectly by the Supreme Court, who made similar interpretation of federal wage regulations last year.

Be aware, however, that this re-allowance is not without limitation. The same qualifications, trials, and rankings will still apply for all student athletes, regardless of gender. If those systems operate as intended, then there should be no noticeable difference in outcomes. And if there are noticeable differences, then this policy would hold that it's those criteria which need to be adjusted, not the over-arching law that calls for such adjustment.

Also, the power of any federal policy can never exceed the reach of federal authority, and the same is true here. This therefore only pertains to those schools that receive federal money for sports, and only for those sports programmes receiving that money.",tway15q1,,l27qc3,gk7vr41

https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/506/224

>After petitioner Nixon, the Chief Judge of a Federal District Court, was convicted of federal crimes and sentenced to prison, the House of Representatives adopted articles of impeachment against him and presented them to the Senate. Following proceedings pursuant to Senate Rule XI—which allows a committee of Senators to hear evidence against an impeached individual and to report that evidence to the full Senate—the Senate voted to convict Nixon, and the presiding officer entered judgment removing him from his judgeship. He then commenced the present suit for a declaratory judgment and reinstatement of his judicial salary and privileges, arguing that, because Senate Rule XI prohibits the whole Senate from taking part in the evidentiary hearings, it violates the first sentence of the Constitution's Impeachment Trial Clause

(This is a separate Nixon from the POTUS).

The ruling at every level, upheld by SCOTUS, was:

>Nixon's claim that Senate Rule XI violates the Impeachment Trial Clause is nonjusticiable.

Further detail:

>A review of the Constitutional Convention's history and the contemporary commentary supports a reading of the constitutional language as deliberately placing the impeachment power in the Legislature, **with no judicial involvement, even for the limited purpose of judicial review.**

This is, quite simply, a sole power of the senate, and the judiciary has zero power to be involved in any manner at all.",PragmaticSquirrel,,l1gpal,gjzduhc
,"The arguments on this fall very strongly on the side of allowing the impeachment trial to proceed in the case of Trump, for four reasons:

**The Removal and Disqualification powers are separate.**

The Constitution in Article I, [says](https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a1_2_5.html)

>Judgement in Cases of Impreachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgement and Punishment, according to Law.

The Constitution specifically allows two judgments for impeachment: removal, and disqualification from future office.

Historically, these powers have been exercised separately.  In particular [8 individuals  (all judges) have been removed by the Senate in US history, but only 3 have been disqualified.](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46185)

The Senate has historically held a second vote after conviction to determine whether or not to disqualify.

Further, the Article II impeachment clause says:

>The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

Assuming there is [no surplusage](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/surplusage) in the Constitution, it doesn't make sense to have the punishments clause in Article I and the separate removal clause in Article II, if the questions of removal and disqualification are inseparable.

**Trump, having been impeached while in office, is in the worst possible position to make this argument.**

We can imagine four categories of people about whom an impeachment might be made:

1. Persons currently holding office.

2. Persons who held office when impeached but subsequently left office.

3. Persons who formerly held office before any proceeding began against them.

4. Persons who have never held office.

I think we can basically go down this list in terms of how strong a case there is that they're impeachable.  Category 1 obviously is, and category 4 is very very likely not.

If any former officials are going to be impeachable, it would be the type of Category 2.  In that case, the proceedings to initiate impeachment were clearly valid and constitutionally permissible, and the only question is whether their leaving office invalidates the impeachment.

**There is strong historical precedent that impeachment can proceed after an official leaves office.**

In particular, the impeachment of Secy. of War William Belknap [was tried by the Senate](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/War_Secretarys_Impeachment_Trial.htm) even though he resigned before the House passed the vote impeaching him.  This is a weaker position for Belknap than Trump, since Belknap resigned even before formal impeachment by the House (just barely, he resigned with minutes to spare).

And indeed, it makes sense that impeachment could proceed after resignation.  Otherwise, all an impeached official would need to do to avoid disqualification would be resign 1 minute before the Senate begins voting on their guilt.  It would make the disqualification penalty utterly toothless.

**The Senate is the ultimate arbiter of the rules on impeachment.**

As laid out in [*Walter Nixon v. United States*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/506/224/) the courts have held that because the Senate is granted the ""sole"" power to try impeachments, the courts have no role in supervising that power, and will not intervene to stop an impeachment.  In particular, the court in *Nixon* said essentially that only three requirements on the Senate are binding:

>the Senate shall be on oath or affirmation; the Chief Justice shall preside when the President is tried; and conviction shall be upon the concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present. 

Anything else would be a nonjusticiable political question, about which no recourse exists in the courts.",huadpe,,l1gpal,gjzhh2g

,"The timing of these situations is key to informing some of their differences. 

I would speculate that the concern with Flynn was at least *partially* motivated by how early Flynn had been in talks with other countries -- concerns were voiced to the incoming Trump admin [almost immediately after Flynn was offered the position](https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-warned-trump-against-hiring-flynn-1494263961). 

Just to make this super clear, the Obama administration voiced their concerns in a private meeting less than 48 hours after the general election. Trump gave a victory speech around [3am on November 9th, 2016](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/presidential-election-updates-trump-clinton-news), and the meeting in question took place [November 10th.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-warned-trump-against-hiring-flynn-1494263961)

Flynn [already had accepted a payment from Russian state media in 2015 and failed to declare that just a month later while renewing his security clearance.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/michael-flynn-trump-investigation-defense-department.html) 

This would indicate to me (again, this is offering speculation) that the scope of the investigation into Flynn only reached Russia because it already probed his issues in Turkey and was seeking to determine if Flynn had violated the Logan Act at any point between the RT payment and his appointment as National Security Advisor. The phone call that the FBI questioned him about may not have actually been a violation of the Logan Act, and remember, as you said, Flynn's crime wasn't the conversation, it was lying to the FBI about the conversation. 

You [mention below](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/l0twr7/presidential_transitions_and_the_logan_act/gjvzlyt/) that the impetus for the FBI investigation was a violation of the Logan Act, and I don't have time to read through all of the documents. Can you show that the violation they believed he committed was during the phone call specifically , and not some other action related to Russia before his selection as National Security Advisor or even related to his failure to register as a foreign agent for Turkey? Because those things both sound much more likely to have been the impetus for an investigation that at some point would have him questioned over the phone call.


On a less legal note, and strictly one about how comparable these actions are, there's also something to be said for the directly retaliatory nature of the phone call. Flynn spoke to Ambassador Kislyak [directly about the Obama presidency's decision to expel Russian diplomats and sanctions **that day**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/transcripts-of-calls-between-flynn-russian-diplomat-show-they-discussed-sanctions/2020/05/29/cc3d29c6-a1f0-11ea-b5c9-570a91917d8d_story.html). This was *direct* meddling in the Obama administration -- Flynn was trying to get Russia to not undertake certain activities *during the Obama admin* to help the incoming Trump admin. I can't identify any way in which the Biden admin is trying to get the members of the Iran deal to undertake activities *during the remainder of the Trump admin* to help the incoming Biden admin, or at least I can't in a vacuum, though admittedly details in the reporting are sparse enough that I could obviously be wrong about that. I'm not super sure about this line of reasoning in general though, so I probably won't defend it very aggressively.

This is why in a vacuum, I would say that is the strongest argument for why Flynn's phone call may have been a violation of the Logan Act: it was a negotiation for foreign policy actions (""don't retaliate"") negotiated by someone who was not a public official, but would have immediate ramifications while that person still was not a public official. There was an intent to *defeat the measures of the United States.* But in the case of hypothetical Biden talks, there is not an intent to defeat measures, because any changes would happen after Biden was already in office.

That said, I would definitely willing to accept that neither the Flynn phone call nor the rumoured Biden talks are violations of the Logan Act.",meikyoushisui,,l0twr7,gjx78ev

Even this bill wouldn't do as much as one might hope, though.  Because the pardon power is granted directly by the constitution, the Supreme Court has concluded that Congress cannot constrain it, and the only limits are themselves constitutional.  In [Ex Parte Garland](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/71/333/), the court held:

>The power of pardon conferred by the Constitution upon the President is unlimited except in cases of impeachment. It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment. **The power is not subject to legislative control.**

So Congress can impose a requirement that the president disclose pardons, but a failure to do so wouldn't invalidate the underlying pardon.  Because Congress can't regulate the pardon power, the only limits are defined by common sense and what the term ""pardon"" means.  This mostly depends, in the constitutional context, on the  [founding era practice](https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2444&context=wmlr) of pardons by the British crown.

,"As a matter of legal necessity, yes. [Public law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_law) must, by its very nature, be known or knowable to the public, or else it cannot have the desired legal effect. A pardon cannot benefit the person pardoned unless it's at least publicly knowable.

That does not mean that it must be broadcast, though, or that there must be a press release about it. But the fact itself must be available to the public by some means, or else the pardon would not have the legal effect it's intended to.

Try to imagine what a 'secret' pardon would look like, and you'll see why this is so. Joe Schmo was convicted for something and sent to prison. That's already public knowledge, because [criminal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law) must also be public knowledge in order to be valid. So, last the public knew, Joe was behind bars. Then one day, you see Joe at a bar. WTF? How is that guy out of prison? You go back and look up his case, and sure enough, his sentence says that he absolutely must be in prison right now. But he's clearly **not**. So what's the explanation? Normally, it would mean that Joe escaped and is on the run. So you call the authorities, who tell you that it's okay. But they can't tell you why, because it's a secret.

Okay, so maybe you're just now lost and confused. But that confusion will follow Joe around. Joe applies for a job, and his employer finds out he's supposed to be in prison, so he calls the cops, who tell him it's okay but they can't say why. And so on.

Obviously, this would not be workable. First of all, Joe is going to have a lot of problems if his pardon is not public knowledge. Second, even it the public eventually figure out what's going on, that only has the same effect, of the pardon being public.

The Idea behind it is that unions collectively bargain with the industries, and take into consideration factors like inflation.

,"The answer is yes, but not for the reason you might suppose.  As discussed below, Congress is free to expel any member at any time for any reason.  So Congress has the constitutional authority to remove members for speeches opposing certification.

At the same time, the speech or debate clause provides categorical protection to those members for any other form of liability for those speeches.  It was perfectly legal to give them.

I'll start with the legality of the speeches.  Members of Congress have extremely broad protection from legal consequences for their official speeches or utterances under the [speech or debate](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-6/clause-1/privilege-of-speech-or-debate) clause of the Constitution.  This makes it essentially impossible to sue or prosecute a Congressman for something they say on the floor of the House (or another Congressional proceeding) even if that conduct is otherwise unambiguously criminal.

In [United States v. Johnson](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/169/), the Supreme Court ruled that a Congressman who had taken a bribe to give a speech on the floor of Congress could not be held criminally liable given the protections of the speech or debate clause.  The court held:

>The Speech or Debate Clause forecloses inquiry not only into the ""content"" of a congressional speech, but into circumstances involving the motives for making it...  Prosecution under a general criminal statute involving inquiry into the motives for and circumstances surrounding a congressional speech is barred even though the gravamen of the offense is the alleged conspiracy, rather than the speech itself.

In short, it's never a crime for a Congressman to say something in a Congressional speech, even if that is connected to other conduct that would be completely unalwful.

But, the speech or debate clause does not protect members of Congress against **Congressional** action (the clause reads:  ""for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any **other** Place \[my emphasis\].""  Just as the Constitution gives very broad latitude to members under the clause, it gives Congress very broad latitude over its own members.

[Article I Section 5](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-i) provides:

>Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.

This grants each house of Congress an unreviewable and discretionary power to expel members.  In [In Re Chapman](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/166/661/), the Court held:

>The right to expel extends to all cases where the offense is such *as in the judgment of the Senate* is inconsistent with the trust and duty of a member \[my emphasis\]

So it's entirely up to the two chambers to decide what justifies expulsion.  There is no requirement that the underlying conduct be criminal (and the first expulsion of William Blount in 1797 [concerned non-criminal conduct](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Constitutional_Law_being_a_view_of_the_p/aWVjAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22In+the+resolution,+the+Senate+declared+him+guilty+of+a+high+misdemeanor,+though+no+presentment+or+indictment+had+been+found+against+him+and+no+prosecution+at+law+was+ever+commenced+upon+the+case,+and+it+seems+no+law+existed+to+authorize+such+prosecution%22&pg=PA302&printsec=frontcover); see also SCOTUS discussion in the case above). As the [Congressional Research Service](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20120105_RL30016_e2006ed1dd0ebc5ce38a2a3f1730bf3170866d15.pdf) observes:

>Except as to the requirement for a two-thirds approval, the authority of each house of Congress to expel one of its own Members is unrestricted by the language of the Constitution. Although such authority appears to be extensive as to the grounds, nature, timing, and the procedure for the expulsion of a Member, policy considerations, as opposed to questions of power or authority, may have generally restrained the Senate and the House in the exercise of their authority to expel.

That is, there is no legal limitation on Congressional expulsions, though Congress has generally declined to use the power except in extreme circumstances.  

This leaves Congress perfectly free to expel members for their speeches against certification (inclusive of doing so on the view that these speeches implicate Section 3 of the 14th amendment).

I think the answer is in your link. Bush is introducing a resolution to expel the representatives. The house can expel a representative with a 2/3rds vote. (Constitution article 1 section 5) for ""disorderly behavior"" or really for any reason.

They don't really have to prove they broke any laws or were a part of an insurrection, they can simply expel them just because with a vote. 

Wikipedia notes that only 5 members have been expelled before, some of them for supporting the confederacy.

Basically, if one Representative and one Senator object to certifying a state's electoral ballots, the issue is then debated for two hours in each chamber and then a Congressional vote occurs. A state's electoral votes could be 'thrown out' with a majority vote.

Historical counterargument(s) here: [https://www.lawfareblog.com/imaginary-unitary-executive](https://www.lawfareblog.com/imaginary-unitary-executive)

While there are many debates about how and why and should this be the case, I am choosing it as the backbone of this point: if the President is the arbiter of his own authority (notwithstanding contrary Congressional Acts, Constitutional Amendments, or Supreme Court decisions), the President also acts as the delegator of his authority. That's a clear de facto result, in my understanding. See e.g. Special Counsels.

So, those premises - while arguable - standing, the only question remains is ""Did he delegate any of his authority to the protestors?""

In my reading, no. The President relies on softer and vague language that OP points out:

>We’re going walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators, and congressmen and women.  
>  
>I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.

Nationalism in the US has created a blatant anti-China bias in the media, so the American media is going to sell the worst possible narrative. Here's an example.

Now read this (hilariously biased) article:
https://www.mango-press.com/who-is-zhang-zhan/ 

I'm not saying that this is a very credible source. But don't you think that if any of these allegations are true (many of which come with primary sources), that maaaaybe CNN should have mentioned them to provide appropriate context?

* She has been filmed harassing public workers attempting to enforce quarantine restrictions

* She has alleged that COVID-19 was an engineered bioweapon

* She is a Christian fundamentalist 

* She has openly protested the CCP multiple times

Two mentioned briefly by CNN (and the least damning):

* She's not from Wuhan, but traveled there to ""report"" on the ""conspiracy"" 

* This is not her first run in with the law

To me that doesn't sound like a """"""citizen journalist."""""" That sounds like a Q-anon blogger storming the capitol. Maybe she had nothing to say at her defense not out of a ""protest"" but because they have her dead to rights. Anyway. 

FWIW I think that it is more plausible than not that some Uyghurs are having their personal freedoms curtailed, just as the closest thing to a mutually agreed-upon narrative. (I know there is a substantial contingent who would not even agree to that.) So this is the state of play: https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/asia/china-xinjiang-united-nations-intl-hnk/index.html

China says it's nothing more than Gitmo-lite. (lol, not that innocent-sounding.) But I've seen a number of arguments made here that are kinda... not relevant? used to defend the practice. That it's a small program, that it's optional, that these are just boarding schools/vocational programs, that it's just to ""acclimate them into China's growing society"" or whatever. Often comes with a quick pivot to the US prison system. (which is absolutely worse and I'll cite that with some ""greatest hits,"" but that's not what we're talking about. https://www.statista.com/statistics/262962/countries-with-the-most-prisoners-per-100-000-inhabitants/

Maybe some or all of these justifications are true. Among CCP defenders, some may just have blind devotion to China. But for those who are actually ideologically engaged, those arguments aren't the ""real"" defense of what's going on. Here's what they won't say, because it sounds really bad to western ears from liberal societies: it doesn't matter, and ""cultural genocide"" isn't a crime against human dignity. As long as people are living in humane conditions, it's the prerogative of the ""capital-S"" State to deprive them of their personal freedoms in what it believes to be to the best interest of the nation.

That last bit I agree with. I don't believe that unlimited free expression is a fundamental freedom. Of course, it isn't one under the laws of any nation I'm aware of. The question is one of where do you draw the line. In the US, it's more of a free-for-all than in a country like Germany, which I'm sure no one would dispute is a liberal democracy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a

In China, personal liberty is more curtailed. (actually, the freedom of speech isn't as clamped down on so much as the freedom for that speech to be heard. Same in the US these days, no? The only ""zero tolerance"" interference in China is with the freedom of assembly. Read this: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/chinas-bizarre-program-to-keep-activists-in-check Chinese political censorship may not look like what you think it does. But I digress.) 

As far as re-education as a concept, that's just... prison. If your values or conduct are repugnant to the state, you may be forced into a facility that tries to expunge those values or behaviors. They're allegedly throwing people in jail for being Muslim. (which, uh. Yeah.) The US throws people in jail for smoking marijuana. Tomato, tomato.

I know that this is a deeply disturbing argument to Americans, but the fact is that this is not substantially different to the conduct of the US. Indoctrination in the US is in the service of creating a strong right-wing tendency and is covert and indirect. (Here's the fastest way I can justify that assertion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93King_suicide_letter) 

In China it is in service of creating a unitary society, and it's more overt and direct. I think that goal is justifiable. Now is ""re-education"" of these people necessary to achieve that goal? Maybe, maybe not. It certainly makes it easier to control a country with one culture. I'm sure that with perfect knowledge, it would be possible to allow each person the most individual freedom their tendencies allow without harming society, but with human administrators, it may still be worth the trade of reducing freedoms to a ""lowest common denominator"" for additional societal stability. (Apologies to Ben Franklin.)

Some of the more disturbing allegations seem to be over the line, to me at least. (forced sterilization, etc) But that is the least corroborated, and again, not an unheard of practice in the US either.

To sum, I think that this is not necessarily an exceptional or immortal practice, but that determination is difficult to make without China being more open about the facilities. Others here have presented arguments about those facts and I'll defer to them. In the mean time, the West will spin this to sound as bad as possible. 

Anyway, that's my take of the matter as an American with no connection to China. I hope that's informative and adequately frank.

,"The [Electoral Count Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Count_Act) as well as § 15 of the US code covers most of how the votes are counted today.For context, When the constitution was written we have to remember the first telegraphs wouldn't be commercially available until the [late 1830's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph#Commercial_telegraphy), so the only form of communications was by snail mail.  Electors met in their [own capitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) in order for the governor to oversee the election and ensure its validity, in which he will certify the vote, make 6 copies and send them to [designated state and federal officials](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/roles).

The sustainment of the objection is stating ""I don't think this piece of paper accurately represents the votes from this state"".  Back before radio, television, and the internet, it was really only that piece of paper that showed who the Electors voted for.

In the objection, both a [senator and a representative](https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/provisions#15) must object.  If that happens, both the senate and House vote independently on the objection.  If a majority of both chambers agree (sustain) to the objection, the Votes are thrown out.

To the root of your question, directly the objection would not overturn the election.  The votes would be discarded - they don't immediately transfer to the other party.  Additionally, the [12th amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) states that in order to be president, you need the majority of Electoral votes (270 today).

Even *IF* both objections we're fully sustained by congress, Biden would still be president. Arizona only has [11 Electoral Votes](https://www.270towin.com/states/Arizona) and Pennsylvania has [20](https://www.270towin.com/states/pennsylvania).  Biden would have still ended up with 275 votes, giving him the presidency.",EnemysGate_Is_Down,,kth1t6,gim2g1q
,"Worth noting, all the Senators (and presumably the Reps, but who knows, there were a lot of them) who were objecting to the vote acknowledged ahead of time that they weren't going to overturn any votes, but that they were essentially going to be a nuisance until the rest of congress agreed to establish a committee to look into voting irregularities in the 2020 election, real or percieved. [Example: Ted Cruz, morning of](https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/1346894325217718276?s=20)


Basically, if you have an objection from a member of one house, sustained by a member of the other, the two houses remove to their respective chambers for a 2 hour debate on whether to accept that state's electors. They then return to the chamber and vote. Those 2 hour debate sessions were essentially going to be brow beating sessions, where the objecting senators were going to make everybody else misserable until they capitulated and agreed to set up an investigatory commission. 

Trump, on the other hand, continued to push the notion of a path to victory until after the riot broke out. 


Also worth noting, they weren't the first to object to electoral college votes. [Democrats objected after EVERY SINGLE STATE that voted for GWB in 2000 and some i  2004, as well as Trump in 2016.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/opinion/democrat-republican-electoral-votes.amp.html).

,"So, there's some complexity here, and I'm sure I can't fully explain it. 

First comes the certification process, and that needed to be completed by December 14th this last election. It was in every state. 

However, if they are completed by December 8th, you hit what is called ""Safe Harbor"" date, where legally the vote cannot be rejected by congress. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/5)

What this means is, Congress, under no circumstance could legally have refused to accept the vote. 

However, there was in conspiracy circles the idea that congress could still reject the vote, when legally they couldn't. I don't know if there's any prescribed punishments for violating safe harbor by objecting, but there is a strong argument that violating it could be considered sedition as objecting past the safe harbor deadline is in effect pushing to overthrow the legally elected leader of the nation.

Seems to be quite widely used to measure democracy in countries. It may come in for some criticism as the organisation measuring it is UK based and their methodology is not clear.

It has the UK at 14th. Not a bad spot compared to other EU countries. It's an old system and has shaken somewhat, but far from fallen apart, even under the stresses of the complex nature of brexit cutting across political party lines.


This is speculation, but hopefully not against the rules of the sub:

I suspect a far bigger impediment to any rejoining would be the government of France. I would imagine it plays very well to the domestic political crowd to exercise their veto (see comments by French politicians). It would be based on the quite legitimate concern that readmitting the UK to the EU would just invite another Brexit in the future. I would imagine that it would, at the very least, require some long term commitments and a great deal of persuasion to overcome these objections.

The Senate has [limited time in session](https://www.congress.gov/days-in-session) and McConnell chose to spend most of that time [confirming judicial nominees rather than passing legislation.](https://www.vox.com/2019/11/29/20977735/how-many-bills-passed-house-democrats-trump) The Senate has [confirmed many judges to fill those vacancies](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/) during the Trump presidency, ultimately benefitting American citizens awaiting justice.

There have been [a few contributing factors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/24/why-does-it-take-so-long-confirm-trumps-appointments/) during the last four years, including Trump taking a long time to submit nominees, but Republicans also charge that Democrats are using Senate procedures, especially post-cloture debate, to delay each and every judicial appointment as much as they can. If judicial appointments is what the Senate is spending its time on, and Democrats are slowing down that process, then the argument goes that they have nobody but themselves to blame for the body spending all its time on that and not taking up other legislation.

There are, of course, countering views to this. One of them is that the large number of vacancies was the result of McConnell himself [using the Senate to prevent judicial confirmations during the Obama administration.](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/05/fact-check-did-obama-leave-trump-with-128-judges-to-appoint/114225090/)

Against  holding the votes: The votes cost time and money, deepen animosity  between Americans, and don't achieve anything positive, being entirely  used by the side forcing the vote for propaganda at the expense of  literally millions of dollars and ripping America apart.

For  holding the votes: Representatives should go on the record for how they  act, and they ARE elected TO VOTE on things, whether for or against.

You should realize that Harry Reid did this exact same thing before McConnel, so it's not at all limited to the Turtle of the Senate.  Further, the use of the Filibuster in the Senate has been used by the minority excessively, with each President since Clinton (Bush then superseded by Obama then superseded by Trump) being the more and more gridlock, even to the point of Trump having the most nominees in history Fillibustered (which is saying a lot since Judicial nominees no longer can be...).  So this is that rare, genuine case of a ""both sides"" thing.

That said, pros and cons:  


.  


Against forcing such votes/For refusing such votes:

A lot of time, an unpopular minority might try to push laws to make the other side look bad and win future elections.  They will do this even if their OWN positions as unpopular.  For example (in reverse of this), the GOP passed repeals of Obamacare/The Affordable Care Act something like 80 times between 2010 and 2016.  Yet when they actually had the power to do it, they had ONE vote under Trump, and it failed to pass.

This is a PR game where one side may have positions that AREN'T popular with the American public, but if they can get their side on the record where it fires up their base (the GOP with repealing the ACA) or the other side on the record of an unpopular position, then they would love to do so.  Because then they can go to voters in the election saying ""See what the other side wants/see what your representative is doing to further your interests?"" and win.

...but because THEIR OWN position is unpopular, when they win, the people of the nation actually get the worse end of the stick.  Basically, they voted under duress/lies, and then get the policies they might have actually hated more.

These are show votes to try to force a moderate candidate from a moderate district to take an unpopular stance so they can be voted out of office, usually only to be replaced with a non-moderate from the other party in that next election.  It basically comes down to the fact that power swings on what the moderate districts do/elect, but the moderate districts want moderate candidates, and taking a stand on either side of MOST issues is going to alienate at least some moderates.

So for example, suppose you have a moderate district on gun rights/control.  The GOP would love to make a Dem representative from that district go on record supporting lots of gun control so that their strongly pro-gun rights candidate can win the next election, while the Dems would love to make a GOP representative from that district go on record supporting repeal of existing laws on guns so that their strongly pro-gun control candidate can win the next election...but the people of that district THEMSELVES likely want a candidate that is neutral on the gun issue, neither favoring new laws nor wanting to repeal existing ones.

So the tactic of forcing people to take such votes that EVERYONE KNOWS will not pass is entirely for propaganda.

Not only does it waste time, it wastes money, as all of those votes and such require Congress people traveling, experts being called in, lobbyists sitting down to present their input, and so on.  It's just hundreds of millions of dollars, which isn't a lot compared to the trillions the US spends per year, but it's still a massive waste of time and money AND it consistently stokes the culture war fires, which largely get nothing done in this nation other than further dividing people.

.

For forcing such votes/Against refusing such votes:

""I was elected to LEAD, not to READ"" -The President in The Simpsons movie

The argument FOR having such votes is that these ARE our representatives.  We elect them to represent us, and that means representing us IN VOTES.  In either saying yes or saying no - decisively - to things we want/oppose, respectively.

By them not having to take a stand, they ride the fence and often you have more extremist candidates present as moderate.  At the very least, it calls into question if these representatives ARE representing their district well.

And also, though ""EVERYONE KNOWS"" these votes will not pass, that's not a sure thing.  There are some votes that, if they came to a vote, would pass.  For example, right now it's pretty likely a $2,000 stimulus check to every American WOULD pass if it came to a floor vote, even though neither side's leadership REALLY wants it to (which is why the House Speaker \[Dem\] wants poison pills with it so it will fail and the Senate Majority Leader \[GOP\] doesn't want to bring it to a floor vote.)

Indeed, on some issues like repealing the PATRIOT Act, you see the ""odd bedfellows"" of both the far left and far right agreeing on the issue, and that there MIGHT be enough votes to pass such a repeal, but the Establishment center of both parties, Dem and Rep, doesn't want it to be repealed and so won't bring it to a vote, or would only do so with poison pills.

So we don't ACTUALLY know that these votes WOULD always fail.

There was a case of this under Obama when Speaker Beohner (GOP)'s House voted to deny then President Obama funding for the Libya war.  It was supposed to be a show vote to say ""bad Mr President! bad!"" and slap at Obama's wrist...

...but then something was quickly realized: It was going to pass it if went to the floor!

As it WAS only supposed to be a show vote, not a resolution that actually DID anything (e.g. they expected it not to pass), the party Establishments were terrified of it passing, so they changed the wording to make it a ""non-binding resolution"".  Which is how Congress says ""we're going to pretend we just did something spending millions of American dollars and time to vote, but we're not actually doing anything.""

So ""don't count your chickens (votes) before they hatch (are cast)"" does apply.  By allowing/forcing these votes, you MIGHT find more (rare?) compromise between the two parties, or cases where the extreme wings of the parties ally (the far left and far right are largely both anti-war, for example), but the American people are robbed of these potential compromises due to the votes never coming to the floor.

.

So in recap:

Against holding the votes: The votes cost time and money, deepen animosity between Americans, and don't achieve anything positive, being entirely used by the side forcing the vote for propaganda at the expense of literally millions of dollars and ripping America apart.

For holding the votes: Representatives should go on the record for how they act, and they ARE elected TO VOTE on things, whether for or against.  By not doing so, districts are not really getting representation (""taxation without representation""..?), and we are robbed of potential compromises and softening of the divisions between Americans that we MIGHT get if more of these votes came to the floor (note the all caps ""MIGHT"", since as noted above, if used as a cudgel it can also DEEPEN those divisions easily...)

,"I'm not sure any of these have been studied in enough detail at large enough scale with low enough research interference to fully answer the question. One of the problems with measuring efficacy of sophisticated psychological or social interventions is the Hawthorne effect: improvement based on receiving attention from a caring research team observing your life. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect

Generally speaking, working from first principles of efficient taxation and benefits allocation, the least complicated system with the lowest administrative overhead across the broadest revenue base generally works the best as long as it isn't done in a regressive way. 

One of the problems I am seeing is that people are not in agreement about what a UBI actually is and how it would work, so the studies are all over the map on effectiveness based on what policy package they are discussing. 

If I look at one of the largest UBI pilots tried in the US, by a young mayor who is a Stanford trained public policy expert, it was broadly successful and provided participants a lot of freedom that they used to get education and better jobs, break generational poverty by improving their care for their kids, and help their families eat better and get better medical care and thus perform better:

However because it's a small closely watched pilot the intervention process itself could easily cause a big share of the improvement compared to the funds given. 

We need to try something state-sized to see how the fraud / waste / abuse would turn out and whether there could be a big disincentive toward other employment that might damage the policy. 

There would also have to be a careful phase out on the UBI funds in order to make it compatible with other entitlements, EITC, the pay you can get in a quote unquote real job, etc. or all of the various programs will be at cross purposes and sabotaging each other instead of cooperating as expected.",blbd,,kog6j5,ghtd9fv
,"I'm no expert, but Negative income tax is equivalent to UBI, it's just a matter of numbers. To use a super simple example imagine there are two people in the country. One earns 60k and the other earns 20k. We'll be ignoring any other taxes aside from those used to fund this program. Say there was a negative income tax such that all income up to 20k is taxed at -50% and all income above that is taxed at 50%. The 20k earner would have -50% tax for all their income, and so would receive 10k. The 60k earner would have -50% tax for their first 20k, and so would receive 10k for that, but then would have 50% tax for their next 40k, and so would pay 20k from that, bringing that to a total of 10k paid in tax. As you can see, we have simply moved 10k from the 60k earner to the 20k earner, bringing them to 50k and 30k respectively.

Compare this to a UBI with the following rules. Every citizen shall receive 20k UBI, which shall be funded by an income tax of 50% for all earners. The 20k earner would pay 10k but then receive 20k, meaning they receive 10k in total. The 60k earner would pay 30k but receive 20k, so they would just be paying 10k in total. You can see that again we have simply moving 10k from the 60k earner to the 20k earner, bringing them to 50k and 30k respectively.

Obviously those are extremely oversimplified, but you can see that it's only a difference of numbers between those two. Maybe it would be better to frame it as a Negative income tax or as a UBI because of how it would be received, but from a mathematical perspective they are equivalent.

So really your question is just ""Is UBI or Earned Income Tax Credit better for reducing poverty?"" I would say UBI. From my understanding EITC can only ever reduce your taxes to zero, which means those who are earning very little would not be helped much at all. Under our current system low income workers already pay very little. It would certainly help them to pay less, but it wouldn't do that much, compared to UBI which could be a large benefit depending on the numbers. You could certainly argue against UBI, and say that the best method is through funding public social programs, but that is different. You could also argue for means-tested systems rather than UBI.

I ran the numbers in an [earlier comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/kaubu5/what_is_the_evidence_supporting_and_refuting_the/gfsqhzs/), which I’ve reproduced here:

----

An improper comparison is being done for the Georgia numbers, as the quoted numbers were produced using unrelated methods that aren't guaranteed to produce comparable numbers.

Their 2016 and 2018 numbers are from the US Election Assistance Commission [Election Administration and Voting Survey](https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/studies-and-reports), but no such report exists for 2020. Instead, they try to manually calculate the number from the [Georgia voter absentee file](https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/voterabsenteefile.do) using this methodology:

>This total was calculated by adding all accepted, rejected, and spoiled absentee/mail-in ballots (1,330,507) and dividing the sum of rejected and spoiled ballots (7,987) by the total.

However, when run on 2016/2018 data, this method does not produce the number quoted in the EAVS report. This is a very strong implication that the number produced using this method cannot be compared with numbers from the EAVS reports.

The absentee files are CSV files. These can be imported into SQLite quite easily:

    SQLite version 3.33.0 2020-08-14 13:23:32
    Enter "".help"" for usage hints.
    Connected to a transient in-memory database.
    Use "".open FILENAME"" to reopen on a persistent database.
    sqlite> .mode csv
    sqlite> .import STATEWIDE.csv statewide

The described methodology appears to imply the following queries (first query is for all accepted, rejected, and spoiled absentee/mail-in ballots, the second query is for just rejected/spoiled ones):

    sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM statewide WHERE ""Ballot Style"" = ""MAILED"" AND (""Ballot Status"" = ""A"" OR ""Ballot Status"" = ""R"" OR ""Ballot Status"" = ""S"");
    sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM statewide WHERE ""Ballot Style"" = ""MAILED"" AND (""Ballot Status"" = ""R"" OR ""Ballot Status"" = ""S"");

My results:

|Year|Accepted/Rejected/Spoiled|Rejected/Spoiled|Percent Rejected/Spoiled|Ballotpedia quoted percent rejected|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|208620|6128|~~1.02%~~ 2.94%|6.42%|
|2018|227718|7987|3.51%|3.10%|
|2020|1317000|8553|0.649%|0.60%|

So clearly Ballotpedia's 2020 methodology is different from that used in the EAVS report, and so the numbers cannot be properly compared. It also appears that the 2020 file is being actively updated, so there's room for the numbers to change.

Prior to the electoral college vote, 59 lawsuits brought by the Trump campaign were dismissed for lack of evidence/standing or were withdrawn.

> “This Court has allowed plaintiff the chance to make his case and he has lost on the merits,” US District Judge Brett Ludwig wrote in an opinion on Saturday, dismissing a Trump campaign lawsuit that accused Wisconsin election officials of violating state law and asking the court to effectively void Biden’s 20,000-vote lead and let the Republican-controlled state legislature decide what to do.

Most opinions follow a similar legal reasoning: lawsuits lack standing (jurisdiction), merit (lack of evidence) or were brought too late (challenges to process after the election and not before). 

For something to be disputed in the legal sense, the arguments have to hold up in court. The fact that all of those lawsuits were dismissed, shows there’s no legal standing to call any EC votes as “disputed”.

Note that it played out differently, but was also only resolved due to a pretty significant ""great compromise"" moment (which also effectively ended Reconstruction and allowed for the following Jim Crow era and had far ranging impacts lasting decades, if not all the way to the present day.)

Granted, that period had some pretty wild election results, such as the 1872 election (where one candidate died and the Democratic party didn't even run a candidate themselves, instead endorsing the Liberal Republican candidate - who was the one that ended up dying) or how basically no one was able to get two terms/reelection for several cycles due to the craziness and a lot of societal/political disruption.

In the 1876 election, if not for the Compromise of 1877 (basically, Democrats/the South agreed to Hayes winning, provided Republicans withdrew troops from the former Confederate states and ended Reconstruction), then the outcome would likely have been disputed to the point of a Constitutional crisis.

>Are there procedures in place if a Vice President refuses or is unable to fulfill this role?

The statute provides that the president of the Senate shall preside over the special joint session of Congress to count electoral votes.  Under [Article I, Section 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei), the Vice President is the president of the Senate but the president pro tempore fills that role if the VP is absent for whatever reason. At present, that is Senator [Chuck Grassley.](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/President_Pro_Tempore.htm)

>What , if any, procedures are in place to verify the certificate presented to the four tellers? Has a Vice President ever falsified the certificate?

In practice, I think it would be quite obvious if the Vice President attempted something like that.  We all are already aware of the electoral college votes, and the certificates are more of a formality.  [3 U.S. Code § 15](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15) does address this though if you keep reading:

>If more than one return or paper purporting to be a return from a State shall have been received by the President of the Senate, those votes, and those only, shall be counted which shall have been regularly given by the electors who are shown by the determination mentioned in section 5 of this title to have been appointed...

Which in turn refers back to [3 U.S. Code § 5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/5), establishing the so-called ""safe harbor"" deadline, which has already passed.  In short, if a state certifies its electors by the deadline (as all states have done), then its determination is conclusive.  Ultimately, there are more provisions if there is a debate, and the final deciding factor is the certification of the governor of the state in question.

Now, the law doesn't really envision fraud on the part of the VP, which is what you seem to be asking about.  In this respect, it's important to note that the Vice President is not fulfilling a discretionary role here, but rather a [ministerial act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ministerial_act).  The language is mandatory.  The Vice President has no choice:

>the result of the same shall be delivered to the President of the Senate, who **shall** thereupon announce the state of the vote, which announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons, if any, elected President and Vice President of the United States",chadtr5,,kefnzg,gg28ybd

A) He could be impeached and removed by Congress.  The Vice-Presidency would be empty until the President nominates a candidate who is then approved by Congress.

As per the first source referenced, the Senate's president *pro tempore* (Grassely) would take his place as acting President of the Senate and assume VP's Senate duties (but not his executive duties). 

B) Congress could do nothing.  In this case, the electoral votes would languish in limbo.  The current President's term would end on January 20th at noon /[source](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xx).  Since no electoral votes have been counted, there would be no President Elect to take office January 20th.  The Speaker of the House (Pelosi, atm) would assume the acting role of President until Congress counted the votes or otherwise chose a President. [Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15).

>What , if any, procedures are in place to verify the certificate presented to the four tellers? Has a Vice President ever falsified the certificate?

Electoral votes are accompanied six copies of Certificates of Attainment, each copy signed by all the electors.  The signed Certificates are sealed and distributed by registered mail as follows: one certificate to the President of the U.S. Senate (the Vice President); two certificates to the Secretary of State of the electors; two certificates to the Archivist of the United States; and one certificate to the judge of the U.S. district court of the district in which the electors met.

The Nevada Supreme Court unanimously rejected a case stating   “that there is no credible or reliable evidence that the 2020 General Election in Nevada was affected by fraud.”

In this one a Trump appointed judge penned the opinion which stated  “Charges of unfairness are serious, but calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.”

And here is one overarching article from the Christian Science Monitor that outlines more cases and their rulings.

So judges across the spectrum, and even those appointed by Trump himself, have not seen anything to merit even hearing many of these cases, and dismiss them outright. 

So far, none of Trump's attorneys have actually stated in court that they have evidence of specific fraud. Here are a couple more articles about the cases detailing what claims Trump's attorneys have actually made in court. 

[https://time.com/5914377/donald-trump-no-evidence-fraud/](https://time.com/5914377/donald-trump-no-evidence-fraud/)

And as most recently as today, Trump's attorneys stated their filing to intervene in the case that Texas filed with the Supreme Court that  *""Despite the chaos of election night and the days which followed, the media has consistently proclaimed that no widespread voter fraud has been proven.

In short, there is no evidence of fraud, and even Trump's attorneys are not making that claim in court where they are bound by legal and ethics rules for what they can claim.

,"I'd make the case that the best evidence we have for fraud would be contained in the legal challenges to the results. 

Even though affidavits are admissible in court, it's important to make a distinction between individual allegations and legally presented evidence of fraud that's widespread and/or systematic enough to have effected the outcome of the election. The latter is really the relevant issue. 

The Trump campaign [has raised over $200 million](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55192699) since the election to pursue cases in various courts across the country with the apparent goal of overturning the results.

Most of the failed claims so far have been repackaged in [the Texas suit](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/12/texas-tries-hail-mary-to-block-election-outcome/) (joined by other states) that petitions the US Supreme Court to intervene and invalidate results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In Georgia, the Republican Secretary of State who ran the election, the Republican Governor who certified the election, the Attorney General who represents the state, and the Lieutenant Governor, all claim they voted for Trump, and simultaneously assert that their state's election was free, fair and secure, resulting in a conclusive win for Joe Biden.

US Attorney General Bill Barr, considered by many to be [one of Trump's staunchest allies,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/15/william-barr-attorney-general-donald-trump-enabler) said in [a recent interview](https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/12/barr-no-evidence-of-widespread-voter-fraud-in-2020-presidential-election/) that the Department of Justice has ""not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.""

There's also the fact that [Republicans as a whole had a very good showing in this election,](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/11/933435840/the-2020-election-was-a-good-one-for-republicans-not-named-trump) picking up seats in the House, likely holding onto the Senate, and enjoying widespread success at the State level. So, if there were widespread fraud aimed at enhancing the Democratic vote or suppressing the Republican vote, it's hard to see how that fits with so much electoral success for Republicans across the board, excepting the President.

To conclude, I think it's reasonable to assume that the best evidence of widespread voter fraud is contained in the lawsuits the Trump campaign and its supporters have filed, and so far, those have been largely unsuccessful. Even in the few cases where they've gained a concession, the resulting remedy hasn't come close to shifting the outcome of the election. On top of that, the allegations of irregularities don't stand up to logical scrutiny.",nosecohn,,kaubu5,gfdcdh6

>When Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen (D) reviewed a list of voters who President Trump’s campaign claimed cast illegal ballots in the state, three names caught her eye: two friends and a constituent.  
>  
>For days, Nguyen pored over public records, spoke with voters by phone and even knocked on doors in person to vet the Trump list. She found that it included dozens of voters who were eligible to vote in Georgia — along with their full names and home addresses.

In short, she was able to show that the Trump campaign didn't do the slightest bit of fact-checking on their allegations, and the people named in the suit as having committing voter fraud are all legal Georgia residents and voters.

,"As a political science student, all the research papers I've ever read on elections and fraud point to election fraud being exceedingly rare in this election and every election in the past century or so. [This article from the Brennan center cites a few of these studies, done by journalists and academics alike. It sums up the issue nicely.](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Briefing_Memo_Debunking_Voter_Fraud_Myth.pdf)  There is not enough actual fraud to have any significant effect on this election nor any other as long as researchers have had access to resources to analyze voting. That is not to say there is not fraud, in fact we've seen cases reported this year. The thing to remember is there is an insignificant number of them to flip any race. Also a most common source of ""fraud"" in any election is legitimate mistakes from voters like filling out forms incorrectly or with outdated information for example. Many of these mistakes can be explained away by confusion and lack of understanding of laws and procedures rather than malice. 

Think about it this way, 155 million votes were cast in this past election. The upper level of fraud found in studies cited by the Brennan Center was 0.02% or 31,000 spread across the country but that is a working paper that hasn't been reviewed. Other papers have it at 0.0003% or lower which is less than 500. Efforts by law enforcement to pursue voter fraud end in dozens of convictions out of millions of votes. It's not efficient or feasible to win an election by voter fraud and the risks are crazy high. You'll get more votes by supporting and  campaigning for your preferred candidate than you will by setting up an elaborate scheme to commit voter fraud. It's much easier to pay for some facebook ads or to tweet a bunch of nonsense to support or attack a candidate than commit actual voter fraud

,"Many of these points are listed on [https://democracyinstitute.org/reasons-why-the-2020-presidential-election-is-deeply-puzzling/](https://democracyinstitute.org/reasons-why-the-2020-presidential-election-is-deeply-puzzling/), you can read the whole article there and it presents all the reasons to have to be at least a little bit suspicious of the election, the sources below I've provided.

1. Late on election night, with Trump comfortably ahead, many swing states stopped counting ballots. In most cases, observers were removed from the counting facilities. Counting generally continued without the observers. \[Observers were falsely told by officials that counting was stopping. Georgia [Source](https://www.ntd.com/georgia-poll-observers-say-they-were-effectively-told-to-go-home_536471.html) Observers forced to stand 30 feet away from ballot counting, despite state laws Pennsylvania [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/philadelphia-vote-counting-ballots/2020/11/04/ea9169f4-1ee2-11eb-ba21-f2f001f0554b_story.html) \]
2. General Abnormalities. Not since President Grover Cleveland’s re-election campaign in 1888 has a sitting president won more votes the second time around and still lost, which is one reason he successfully ran again four years later. To put this in perspective, Obama [lost](https://reason.com/2012/11/19/barack-obama-first-president-re-elected/) 5 million votes between his 2008 and 2012 elections. He is the only president to have lost voters and still won re-election. By comparison, Trump not only added about 10 million votes to his 2016 haul but also shattered the record for most votes received by a sitting president. Trump won a greater share of [minority votes](https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2020/11/05/trump-the-racist-won-more-minority-votes-than-any-gop-candidate-since-1960-n1126235) than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 and brought more Democrats [over to his side](https://www.newsweek.com/10-percent-democrats-will-vote-trump-poll-says-1516431) than in 2016. More than nine in 10 [evangelical Christians](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/13/poll-90-percent-of-evangelicals-support-donald-trumps-re-election/) voted to re-elect the president. For Trump to [expand his coalition](https://nypost.com/2020/11/07/why-trump-grew-his-numbers-with-black-and-latino-voters/) of voters so substantially and still lose is historic.
3. The failure to match signatures on mail-in ballots.  \[Source: [https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-election-2020-pittsburgh-elections-presidential-elections-fc464c287c18823ff57fedc13facf7e5](https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-election-2020-pittsburgh-elections-presidential-elections-fc464c287c18823ff57fedc13facf7e5)\]
4. Historically low absentee ballot rejection rates despite the massive expansion of mail voting. Such is Biden’s narrow margin that, as political analyst Robert Barnes observes, ‘If the states simply imposed the same absentee ballot rejection rate as recent cycles, then Trump wins the election’. \[Low rejection rates of swing states specifically Georgia and Pennsylvania in 2020 compared to prior years is listed here with corresponding sources: [https://ballotpedia.org/Election\_results,\_2020:\_Analysis\_of\_rejected\_ballots](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2020:_Analysis_of_rejected_ballots)\]
5. Missing votes. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 50,000 votes held on 47 USB cards are missing. \[Expert witness testimony [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3WK0M4S\_Qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3WK0M4S_Qw), article describing content: [https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt\_app/poll-watcher-describes-pennsylvania-election-irregularities-including-47-missing-usb-cards\_3594549.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_app/poll-watcher-describes-pennsylvania-election-irregularities-including-47-missing-usb-cards_3594549.html)\]
6. Non-resident voters. Matt Braynard’s Voter Integrity Project estimates that 20,312 people who no longer met residency requirements cast ballots in Georgia. Biden’s margin is 12,670 votes. \[Braynard, Voter Integrity Project: Findings and Conclusions, at 25:35, YouTube (Nov. 24, 2020) (This video encapsulates the findings of the Voter Integrity Project's analysis and presents Matt Braynard's conclusions and recommendations.), available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9ihoLi1NA&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9ihoLi1NA&feature=youtu.be) and article describing content [https://tennesseestar.com/2020/11/29/voter-integrity-project-leader-matt-braynard-to-submit-absentee-vote-findings-to-georgia-case/](https://tennesseestar.com/2020/11/29/voter-integrity-project-leader-matt-braynard-to-submit-absentee-vote-findings-to-georgia-case/).\]

,"As a point of confusion, the linked PDF there has 43 pages, [while the one from the Texas Attorney General has 154.](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/SCOTUSFiling.pdf)  I live in Wisconsin, and it's interesting that the only actual instance of the word ""Wisconsin"" in the [supremecourt.gov](https://supremecourt.gov) link is in the title and a later footnote, when the one from Texas has an entire section.  Looking more closely, it seems your linked document only contains the Pennsylvania section.  Is the supreme court breaking these into multiple cases? I don't know how this normally works, but worth pointing out.

As for the one from the Texas AG in regards to Wisconsin, there's essentially four separate claims, two of which are things that definitely, provably happened and their legality is being challenged, and two that there are accusations of that I can't find proof for.

I'll start with the two (imo) biggest claims. 

1) Wisconsin law has strict rules about ballot dropboxes that were allegedly not followed in Dane and Milwaukee counties

2) Wisconsin law has signature and voter ID exceptions for persons that are ""indefinitely confined"".  Officials in Dane and Milwaukee counties encouraged voters to declare themselves ""indefinitely confined"" due to covid.

To start, there were ballot dropboxes some manned and some unmanned.  Per the Wisconsin law referenced in the suit, unmanned dropboxes are illegal, and allegedly the people running the manned dropboxes and the way in which they ran them and delivered the ballots were also illegal.  I'll defer to the suit for more details, since the legalese is wordy and I don't have a source for how the manned dropboxes were actually ran.

The ""indefinitely confined"" voter laws were intended for people who are extremely ill or otherwise... indefinitely confined.  The argument is that officials abused this law and the current covid situation to circumvent voter ID laws.  [The election commission did put out a statement that basically said ""it's up to you to decide, but don't do it to circumvent voter ID laws"".](https://elections.wi.gov/node/6788) There is no proof required to claim you are indefinitely confined.

Ultimately, the number of ""indefinitely confined"" voters [increased to 215,000, 11% of all voters, or 4x compared to the 2016 election.](https://wkow.com/2020/11/13/concerns-over-indefinitely-confined-voting-law-as-thousands-use-the-option-due-to-covid-19/)  This is ten times the \~20,000 vote margin of the 2020 election.  I could not find a number for ballots collected by drop boxes in Dane or Milwaukee county, but given these are the largest and most liberal counties in Wisconsin, I'd wager it's probably in the five figures.  It will be up to courts to decide if Wisconsin law was violated, but at the very least there are more than enough votes here that could be thrown out to swing the election.

The other claims, which seem harder to prove and unlikely to swing the election, are:

3) Per poll watchers, officials in Milwaukee county were filling in addresses for ballots that did not include the witness's address, when Wisconsin law states they should be returned.

4) Per one USPS contractor, USPS workers were backdating ballots that were mailed too late.

Personally, I expect nothing to come from this lawsuit. The only reason I even looked this up was because the claims themselves weren't in any of the local news articles, only comments that they were ""delusional"", ""baseless"", and ""debunked"", despite omitting the claims.",Keith_McPherson,,kaubu5,gfferft

,"I hate to play the ""this is moot"" game, but my understanding is that the very Bush v. Gore precedent that they cite is exactly the reason that the Supreme Court will (or at least *should*) refuse to hear this case.

The Texas AG argues that

>[The Supreme] Court is the only forum that can delay the deadline for the appointment of presidential electors under 3 U.S.C. §§ 5, 7.

but Bush v. Gore implicitly ruled exactly the opposite, that in Florida, not meeting the Safe Harbor deadline would be a violation of Florida Election Code. Under [3 U.S.C. § 5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/5), the determinations made in each of these states are conclusive. It is the judicial precedent established in Bush v. Gore that precisely makes this case moot. 

And at risk of engaging in too much snark for this subreddit, I wonder if the Texas AG sees the obvious irony of claiming that the election methods used in each state were unconstitutional because they did not follow the election laws in each state, and then asking the Supreme Court to change the election laws in those states.

The Texas AG alleges that

2. Revise section 230 to state legal speech can't be censored and censoring legal speech would make these companies liable to lawsuits in the event they censor legal speech.

This argument seems like an attempt to paint Republicans as engaging in hypocrisy by characterizing Section 230 as laissez-faire.  But it seems like Section 230 is actually the opposite of laissez-faire policy.

>As a system of thought, laissez-faire rests on the axioms[1] that the individual is the basic unit in society and has a natural right to freedom; that the physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system; and that **corporations are creatures of the state and therefore the citizens must watch them closely** due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian spontaneous order.[2]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire

,"I suggest everyone actually read the text of [47 U.S. Code § 230 - Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material] (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230) Paragraph f(2) that clearly defines what an Interactive Computer Service is: ""The term “interactive computer service” means any information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational institutions."" which is precisely what Twitter, Facebook, and similar platforms are. 

Paragraph (c)(2)(A) is the root of the problem: ""any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or **otherwise objectionable**, **whether or not such material is constitutionally protected**"". This gives Twitter, Facebook, and any other ""interactive computer service"" the right to arbitrarily restrict access or availability (i.e. censor) any content that they find objectionable, even if the content is constitutionally protected. Fix this language in the legislation.

That's their out for censoring content they find objectionable, even if it is political discourse, and they know it. 

The problem is that our lawmakers aren't versed enough in technology, and even if they are, they are the ones who have the power to modify or adjust the current legislation. The addition of something along the lines of ""**No interactive computer service, as defined in this statute shall censor or otherwise restrict, enable, or participate in any way in political discourse that is published or created by any of their users.**"" would easily close that loophole.

,"You can pardon someone preemptively for a *specific* offense or act, but it's probably unconstitutional to grant a pardon that is both pre-emptive and open-ended (does not specify the offenses or conduct being pardoned).    This is an unclear area because the Supreme Court has never ruled on it, but it follows as a matter of both original meaning and logic.

There's an important difference between a specific and a general pardon.  Carter's [pardon](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/proclamation-4483-granting-pardon-violations-selective-service-act) of draft dodgers was pre-emptive (in most cases) because the individuals had not been charged or convicted, but was also specific and limited to the relevant offenses.  Ford's pardon of Nixon which was totally open-ended.  Ford [pardoned](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/740061.asp) Nixon for ""for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9,1974,""  It wasn't just a Watergate pardon.  If it later came out that Nixon had snuck out one night in 1971 to murder someone in DC, that would also have been (apparently) covered.

Both case law and history support the first form of pardon.   The Supreme Court endorsed pre-emptive pardons of this kind in [Ex parte Garland](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/71/333/) (1866):

>The power of pardon conferred by the Constitution upon the President is unlimited except in cases of impeachment. It extends to every offence known to the law, and may **be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken** or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment. The power is not subject to legislative control \[my emphasis\].

The history is also supportive.  This is one of the rare issues that the founders actually discussed.  One [of the delegates](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_827.asp) at the constitutional convention made a motion to insert the words ""after conviction"" into the sentence on pardons, ruling out pre-emptive pardons.  This motion failed in response to the argument that ""pardon before conviction might be necessary in order to obtain the testimony of accomplices.""

Pre-emptive but open-ended pardons are, however, much more exotic and would not have been known to the founders.  The Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of an open-ended pardon.  On an originalist basis, such pardons are probably off limits insofar as pardons granted by the English crown (which served as the model for the undefined term ""pardons"" in the constitution) could only be granted for specific offenses ([Duker](https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2444&context=wmlr) 532-533).  When the founders referred to a pardon without further describing (the clause is terse and has no detail), they were presumably invoking this English concept.

Under English common law, pardons for open-ended offenses were invalid insofar as a pardon was an act of mercy [granted for a specific offense](https://opencommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1319&context=law_papers) of which the King was aware.  As William Hawkins (one of the most prominent sources of founding era common law) wrote:

>A felony can not be well pardoned \[if\] the king, when he granted the pardon, was not fully apprised of the state of the case ... much less doth it seem reasonable that a felony should be well pardoned where it doth not appear that he knew anything of it.

That is -- how can you show mercy and grant a pardon if you don't even know what you're showing mercy for? Thus under English practice, Hugh MacGill [writes](https://opencommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1319&context=law_papers):

>The king's knowledge of the particular crime or penalty imposed for it must appear on the face of the charter, or it will not be assumed that he intended to pardon it. The specificity of the king's intention must be reflected in the specificity of the language of the charter

I think this also follows quite logically as a matter of policy.  A pardon for unknown offenses is open to all manner of abuse, and is inconsistent with the checks and balances intent underlying the pardon power.   Given the absence of precedent, the matter is unsettled but the case against open pardons seems fairly clear.

Thus, Trump is plainly free to pardon Giuliani for specific crimes that Giuliani has committed.  He probably does not have the power to issue an open pardon to Giuliani covering his conduct generally.   This creates a general problem: Giuliani would need to confess to Trump all the various crimes he has committed with some level of specificity in order to be pardoned for them (whether or not investigators are presently aware of the behavior).  Trump's pardon of Giuliani would also need to disclose those crimes with some level of specificity in order to be (clearly) valid.",chadtr5,,k4oya4,geacjym

,"I think it's important to appreciate that courts operate in two different modes regarding how they view evidence and legal claims, depending on whether they're viewing evidence for the first time (like a typical jury trial) or reviewing the entire case upon appeal. In a 'first review' or 'de novo' trial, such as a jury trial, each party introduces evidence to prove how specific points of law should apply to their specific situation. For example if a party is suing their employer for discriminating against them on the basis of religion, they would probably first argue that their behavior should be protected as a 'sincerely held religious belief', and they would then introduce evidence to prove their sincerity, such as testimony from their fellow church members. **It would then be up to the jury to determine whether that evidence is believable**.

By contrast if that same case goes up for appeal, even all the way to the US Supreme Court, the court will typically accept the evidence in the factual record as true and accurate. That means if the lower court (i.e. the jury) agreed that one of the parties sincerely held the beliefs of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, then the appeals court will not question that and just accept it as fact. 

See section on 'appellate procedure' at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_procedure_in_the_United_States. 

This is generally the same way that courts will judge any type of 'reasonableness' standard, meaning they will rely on the jury to determine what's reasonable under the specific circumstances of each case. 

These are not definitive sources, but rather two different law review articles that make generally the same arguments:
http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/fac_artchop/1152

https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/questioning-sincerity-the-role-of-the-courts-after-hobby-lobby/",jcmtyler,,k3rvvw,ge531bx
,"Let's clarify your question a little. You're talking about three distinct areas of law with four different standards. 

We can dispense immediately with disparate-treatment employment discrimination, which [doesn't include sincerity as a prong](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/section-12-religious-discrimination#_Toc203359488). In workplace discrimination claims, only religious accommodation requires a showing of sincerity. 

The document I linked shows the EEOC's broad guidelines on evaluating sincerity in these cases. It also shows that, in these cases, adherence is indeed a highly relevant factor, but not necessarily dispositive.

Ultimately, a jury is instructed to find whether a plaintiff held a sincere religious belief, and that's a finding they must make explicitly. [Here](http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/161230.P.pdf) is a random Fourth Circuit appeal on such a case that observes the jury was correctly instructed and made such a finding. (A judge can make such a finding in a bench trial, in which both parties have waived their right to a jury. It's also possible for the defendant to stipulate sincerity.)

Prisoner food is another animal entirely, so to speak. It's a claim under the [Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000](https://www.justice.gov/crt/42-usca-2000cc). It has no sincerity prong, so there's no need to make such a claim. Instead, it focuses on balancing whether the government ""substantially burdens"" religious practice against its own interests and whether they use the least restrictive means to do so.

Finally, draft exemptions. Forget about *US v. Seeger*. It's not bad law, but [Welsh](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/398/333) is now controlling. *Seeger* took place when there was a ""supreme being"" clause in the conscientious objector statute, but since it was amended the Court found that its protection was more expansive. The finding in *Seeger* that practice of religion isn't necessary is no longer relevant, since the statute no longer suggests such a thing. 

However, sincerity is important. In both *Seeger* and *Welsh*, the government stipulated sincerity. Had they not, it would be a question for a jury.  This isn't a question of sincere *religious* belief, however; under *Welsh* the standard is "". . . those whose consciences, spurred by deeply held moral, ethical, or religious beliefs, would give them no rest or peace if they allowed themselves to become a part of an instrument of war.""",almillarskovich,,k3rvvw,ge5i84f
,"The standard of review is highly deferential, meaning that claims of a sincerely held religious belief are nearly always accepted.  As [Chapman](https://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2152&context=fac_artchop) summarizes: ""No one has offered a defense of the adjudication of religious sincerity under the ordinary pleading and evidentiary standards."" 

That is, sincerity is a factual question that can, in principle, be settled by a trial court but it is handled differently than any other factual question on a basis that ends to assume that claims are true.  The third circuit summarized in [Davis v. Fort Bend County:](http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/13/13-20610-CV0.pdf)

>\[J\]udicial inquiry into the sincerity of a person’s religious belief “must be handled with a light touch, or judicial shyness... Indeed, the sincerity of a plaintiff's engagement in a particular religious practice is rarely challenged and claims of sincere religious belief in a particular practice have been accepted on little more than the plaintiff's credible assertions.

This is an incredibly low bar within the standards of our legal system.  The underlying issue here is the [religious question doctrine](https://docs.rwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1091&context=law_fac_fs), which precludes courts from diving into theological questions.  In [Presbyterian Church v. Hull](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep393/usrep393440/usrep393440.pdf), the court held that the first amendment ""plainly ... forbids civil courts"" from engaging in the ""interpretation of particular church doctrines and the importance of those doctrines to religion.""  

As a logical matter, it is difficult to address sincerity without some kind of (prohibited) judicial inquiry into the beliefs themselves.  The famous case here is [United States v. Ballard](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep322/usrep322078/usrep322078.pdf), which concerned the prosecution for fraud of the Ballard family who claimed they could use religious powers to heal people of otherwise incurable diseases and solicited millions of dollars from victims who were promised such healing.  The case is a bit complex, but the court reiterated that it could not assess whether or not such claims were true given their religious nature (that is, it was not relevant as an evidentiary matter whether or not the Ballards could actually heal people):

>The religious views espoused by the respondents might seem incredible, if not preposterous, to most people.  But if those doctrines are subject to trial before a jury charged with finding their truth or falsity, then the same can be done with the religious beliefs of any sect.  When triers of fact undertake that task, they enter a forbidden domain.

This holding eventually led to the dismissal of the case, but the majority deliberately ignored the issue of sincerity despite the fact that, as noted in the dissent, the trial court had concluded that the claims were fraudulent (knowingly false):

>The representations \[of the power to heal, etc.\] were ""falsely and fraudulently"" made .. \[the Ballards\] ""well knew"" that these representations were untrue, and that they were made by respondents with the intent to cheat and defraud those to whom they were made... \[the jury found\] on ample evidence that the respondents were without belief in the statements which they had made to their victims.

The majority was, therefore, a bit disingenuous in what it was doing, but Justice Jackson wrote separately to say the quiet part out loud:

>I should say that the defendants have done just that for which they are indicted... They were brought to trial for mail fraud on an indictment which charged that their representations were false that they ""well knew"" they were false... The trial judge ... ruled that the court could not try whether the statements were untrue, but could inquire whether the defendants knew them to be untrue; and, if so, they could be convicted.  
>  
>I find it difficult to reconcile this conclusion with our traditional religious freedoms... I do not see how we can separate an issue as to what is believed from considering what is believable... any inquiry into intellectual honesty in religion raises profound psychological problems... I would dismiss the indictment and have done with this business of judicially examining other people's faiths.

That is, Jackson thought courts could not even legitimately inquire into sincerity.  As sometimes occurs, Jackson's opinion  [subsequently became](https://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2152&context=fac_artchop) more influential than the majority.  The result is that any religious claims are granted extraordinary deference, and even the plausibility of such claims is not an element of tests for sincerity.

This does not make it *impossible* to assess sincerity, though it makes it very hard.  Courts are left to consider evidence about the the witness's [overall credibility](https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/questioning-sincerity-the-role-of-the-courts-after-hobby-lobby/) and non-religious motivations.  The key case here is [Witmer v. United States](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep348/usrep348375/usrep348375.pdf), which involved a Jehovah's witness claiming exemption from military service as a (religious) conscientious objector.   Witmer had initially objected to military service seeking exemption as a farmer without raising religious objections.   This was denied.  He then claimed to be a full-time minister.  This too was denied and he only then raised explicit religious objections.   The court found that Witmer ""stated his \[religious\] beliefs with apparent sincerity,"" but also that his initial claim to be a farmer was fraudulent:

>We note that when Witmer asked his \[draft\] Board for classification as a farmer, he knew that the land involved in his request had not been cultivated for 23 years... \[this\] goes to his sincerity and honesty ... it would not be mere suspicion of speculation for the Board to conclude, after denying Witmer's now abandoned claims of farmer and minister, that he was insincere in his claims of conscientious objection.

Thus given the evidence that Witmer was lying about *other* things, the court allowed an inference that his religious beliefs were insincere.  What's important here is that this didn't actually involve any inquiry into Witmer's religious beliefs or practices -- it was the other evidence that was important.   Let's assume that the board was right and Witmer *was* insincere.  If he had simply stated that (insincere) belief without first providing the false justifications, then he would have received the exemption.   The religious question doctrine closes off questions that would intuitively seem relevant such as whether or not the theology of Jehovah's witnesses prohibits military service or whether Witmer was someone who genuinely followed the relevant teachings.  

This is roughly how courts handle ""opportunistic"" claims of sincere belief -- not by looking into the beliefs themselves but by looking at other forms of evidence that surround it and inform judgments of credibility.  [US v. Quainatance](https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/09/09-2013.pdf) is one of the most prominent, involving a couple who claimed to be adherents to the ""Church of Cognizance"" which teaches that marijuana is a sacrament.  The court made no inquiry into the purported theology of the church but instead identified other evidence suggesting the defendants were lying and permitting their conviction.  

Courts are also incredibly reluctant to draw a line as to what qualifies as ""religious.""  The Supreme Court has [never](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1205&context=jbl) offered a definition of religion (though they have considered various standards), and the standard is again very deferential if you claim that the beliefs are religious in nature; the relevant question is whether the belief is religious in the person's ""own scheme of things."" 

There is, however, considerable variation under state vs. federal law on this issue.  Veganism, for example, is not considered a religion under California law [but is](https://ghslaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Defining-religious-practice-under-federal-anti-discrimination-laws.pdf) considered a religion under federal law.

TL;DR: Review is highly deferential for both ""sincerity"" and ""religious"" and tests for sincerity focus on external, non-religious evidence about credibility.",chadtr5,,k3rvvw,ge5v3zp
,"I'm not sure about your second question, but I don't believe religious institutions are ever treated for sincerity. Yes, it's true that someone like John Oliver can set up his own [money-making church](http://www.ourladyofperpetualexemption.com/), but that's what freedom of religion is.

From what I can tell, the VP's role comes down to tradition and a willingness to wield power at the risk of disruption. The legal restrictions are not very well defined, though Senate rules can constrain them.

The Vice Presidency is [one of the only positions in government whose role straddles two branches: executive and legislative.](https://people.howstuffworks.com/vice-president4.htm) Unlike the House, where the members elect the leader, the Constitution explicity makes the VP the presiding officer over the Senate. That gives them a lot of power to set the body's agenda, but Senate rules allow members to elect a president pro tempore who fills the role when the Vice President is absent. 

Recent tradition is that the Vice President simply doesn't show up unless there's a tie to be broken, deferring to the president pro tempore to preside. But historically, [many Vice Presidents did show up:](https://www.senate.gov/general/Features/pro_tem_display.htm) 

> For many years, the vice president routinely presided over the Senate, and presidents pro tempore were elected to serve *only during the absence of the vice president.* [emphasis added] [...] Since the mid-20th century, tradition has dictated that the position go to the senior member of the majority party.

If the VP does preside, they have considerable Constitutional power to determine what does and doesn't come to the floor for a vote, even extending to the ability to block the election of the president pro tempore. In order to guard against this possibility, the Senate has endeavored through its own rules to [limit the powers of the body's president,](https://www.legislativeprocedure.com/blog/2018/8/10/how-the-vice-president-limits-the-power-of-senate-majorities) because they have no way to prevent the VP from taking over the role from the pro tempore at any time.

>On Capitol Hill, for the first time the vice president sat in on the Republican caucus meetings. Former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson tried to do that when he became vice president, but as former Vice President and Sen. Walter Mondale reports, Johnson was quickly rebuffed.

It inhibits free discussion among senators and, he adds, ""it's a tip-off to the executive branch about what the Senate's going to do.""

As to the advantages and disadvantages, others will have to provide evidence for that, I can only give my opinion. I'm not sure it makes a lot of difference, unless the president has not a single supporter in the legislative body, he is still able to have bills prepared and to have them proposed in the legislature ([because anyone can write a bill, but only a member of Congress can introduce one on the floor](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-legislative-branch/)), though if his supporters are in the minority, the leadership may choose to deprive these bills of consideration through their control on the legislative agenda.

I'll point out though that just because the President can submit bills directly to the legislature doesn't mean he can force their passage. The legislature is still free to amend it or shoot it down. So the potential for abuse is, in my opinion, not really high.",kchoze,,k1ruio,gdsbf68

It says that legislation introduced by the Brazilian President has a higher chance of success than bills introduced by legislators, but that's largely because the President can also determine, in some circumstances, which bills are brought up for debate.

It goes on to talk extensively about Costa Rica, where the Excecutive branch does have the ability to introduce legislation, but it strongly suggests that this ability is far less influencial on legislative success than agenda control. If the President, through his legislative allies or his own powers under the Costa Rican constitution, can control which bills are debated and voted on, it matters much more than who introduced the bill.

I welcome being corrected, but couldn't the President (as well as executive agencies and the executive in general) gain the power to introduce legislation by amending the House of Representatives (and potentially the Senate) Rules of Procedure? While the [non-voting representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-voting_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives?wprov=sfla1) can't vote on legislation (they can in committee), they are allowed to debate bills as well as introduce them.

,"In addition to Brazil, you can look to parliamentary systems where the cabinet is part of the legislature and writes and introduces legislation directly all the time.

I think this is superior because the non-partisan public service which works with this legislation everyday is the one that is shaping it (though stake holder consolations still happens through the public service and in the parliamentary process).

Compare that to the US where a lot of legislation is made by interest groups or policy think tanks which results in very lopsided legislation.

1. Trump's staff has [historically high turnover](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/), so replacing folks seems to be business as usual for the White House.
2. In the first article you link to, the advisor they talk about the most (retired Col. Douglas MacGregor) advocates for troop withdrawals from various places.  That seems like a good sign for those who are against a strike.  As you mention, the article also states that other appointees are ""Iran hawks"" but is much less specific on those.

3. I find the second article you linked to encouraging, quite frankly.

Claim: The suit objected to an extension allowing mail-in voters to show identification, if originally missing. The deadline was extended to Nov. 12; the suit said the deadline should be Nov. 6.  

Status: On Nov. 5, the court ordered the affected ballots separated and held for verification. The Republican Party of Pennsylvania then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. On Nov. 6, the Supreme Court ordered ballots to be separated and counted separately. That means the ballots could be excluded in later rulings.

,"[I think the most efficient summary one could present at this point is one word](https://globalnews.ca/news/7457776/trump-election-lawsuits-record/): Dead. 

They might well continue, potentially all the way up until the Electoral College meets and renders the whole question moot—but the fact is, Trump's lawsuits are incredibly shaky. What few have not already been thrown out for lack of grounds are often over matters affecting virtually no votes. Put bluntly, Trump could win every single case in the courts right now and it would not even make a blip on the overall election. His legal team, as evidenced by the fact it is run by Rudy Gulliani is, quite frankly, not actually a legal team. It has no hope of overturning the results in any swing state by legal means (and any hope they had that the states themselves might overturn the results[ died days ago](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-biden-states-senate-electors-1.5802587)) and it would require not only unlikely wins in cases which are, quite bluntly, utterly meritless, but would require the courts to respond to them with unprecedented steps (namely, actually ignoring the results of the election as they stand) even if he won. In Bush v. Gore, stopping the count [handed Bush the win because Bush was ahead when things stopped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore). Trump would need the courts, not to stop the count, but to retroactively remove ~100K votes across several states to squeak out an electoral college win. 

What does this mean? It means that their legal strategy is in fact, entirely political. There is literally no path to victory through the courts, nor has there been since Biden's win was called in Georgia. Winning now would require Trump to flip 3-4 states (depending on which ones flipped) and even that would put him so close to 270 that faithless electors might play a role. This whole effort seems laser-focused, not on changing the actual results of the election, but on undermining public trust in them. [Compare how Trump and his surrogates talk about things to how his lawyers do](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-cries-election-fraud-in-court-his-lawyers-dont-11605271267). One group alleges extensive evidence of fraud amounting to hundreds of thousands of ballots and thousands of tips—the other files lawsuits over how many steps away poll watchers had to stand during a pandemic and procedural rules that affect a couple of votes. This is a contradiction that only makes sense if one considers it from a PR perspective. It cannot be a legal strategy—because quite frankly, saying one thing in court and another in public is only effective at pissing off the judge. Instead, it's a PR strategy. The campaign asserts massive fraud, then tells its voters that they have filed lawsuits. Most people will neither read nor understand the details of those lawsuits, so this creates a natural assumption—that the lawsuits are an attempt to prove the claims of massive voter fraud. The Trump campaign has to know by this point that they cannot win legally—and so they are instead acting to make it look like the election was stolen by fraud, then that fraud ignored by the courts. And the scary part is, it's working. [With absolutely **no** evidence, between 70 and 80% of Republican voters believe there was some form of fraud.](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/09/republicans-free-fair-elections-435488) And I feel the need to point out—those results are a week old now.

We have no high ground coverage, there's a lot of exposure to small arms fire, we cannot secure these areas, and it is not safe,"" the [White House] staff has definitely said, ""All right, we'll move it around, we'll find something else.""

So for instance where it talks about the POTUS not being able to just pick up a phone to dial a friend--well if you work with them to setup a time frame where you can Zoom call your best college buddy, they might be able to setup the secure network and stuff for you to do that on.

,"This is not a direct answer to your question but since you mentioned the explicitly partisan efforts in North Carolina, Michigan, and Wisconsin as well as the Supreme Court cases over gerrymandering I feel its useful to copy my comment from a somewhat similar post to provide extra context to you and other about the extent of the gerrymandering being practiced by Republicans:

>Problem with simply diverting power back to the sates comes from the fact that Republicans have, and still are, putting in [years of research and effort in gerrymandering states](https://theintercept.com/2019/09/27/gerrymandering-gop-hofeller-memos/) so that they can unilaterally control state governments. Many of their gerrymandering efforts are explicitly racist and push to minimize the political power of minorities. It is part of how they get such crazy situation like Wisconsin where Republican's control 63 out of 99 Assembly seats and 18 of 33 in the State Senate despite earning less than 40% of the vote sate-wide. [If they pick up 6 more seats in the state they will be able to pass any legislation they want regardless of the Governor's veto.](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/wisconsin-republicans-look-to-flip-6-seats-for-veto-proof-legislative-majority/article_a20fa78d-129c-5369-aa97-42d235e3a334.html) And they will have ultimate authority in redrawing district maps and making their gerrymandering even more powerful in the future. 

Essentially, the Republicans are operating a decades long tactic to swing state governments by controlling districts through gerrymandering. Much of the gerrymandering being used is explicitly racist but uses the language of the VRA to make explicit minority-majority areas so minorities are guaranteed representation while also making those the (as close to as possible) only districts of the state that are Democrat controlled. This type of gerrymandering allows Republicans to work around the VRA without being in violation of it. This increasing control of state government also allows Republicans to be in charge of redistricting every 10 years to further cement and expand on their gain.

,"Before the SCOTUS decision, it's important to remember that the usual counting had already been finished, and there had already been [a number of recounts using various methods](https://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/13/got.here/index.html), including hand recounts, that still left Bush with a marginal lead.  Perhaps in an alternate universe with less restrictive election laws this statistically insignificant result would have triggered a runoff, but that's not how the US system works.  It's one day, one shot, winner take all.

The full machine recount reduced Bush's lead considerably, but still left him in front.  Meanwhile hand recounts continued in various counties, but the Republican Secretary of State set a deadline that was too early for many of them to finish. 

The arguments therefore focused instead on ballots that were not counted, or were in doubt, particularly with regard to ballots where vote counters would have to individually determine the voter's ""intent"":   

> Many Americans hear the word ""chad"" -- a reference to the small piece of paper punched out of punchcard ballots -- for the first time. Soon, ""hanging chad,"" ""dimpled chad"" and ""pregnant chad"" are phrases that enter everyday conversation ...  In Palm Beach County, an unexpectedly large vote for third-party candidates leads to questions about the ""butterfly ballot"" there, where the names of candidates are placed on the left and right columns of a page and a series of punch holes are found in a center column. Large numbers of disqualified ballots, or ballots where no vote is registered for president, are found in other counties.

Because voter intent could only be determined by a hand recount, and because other counties had already certified their results with machine recounts, SCOTUS ostensibly ruled that the hand recounts violated equal protection -- which I suppose is to say, if Palm Beach and Dade County were to conduct hand recounts, all the other counties should have had the opportunity to do the same, using the same rules, and it was too late to do so.

There are any number of problems with this decision, which is why the majority decision included the following disclaimer (from the Wikipedia article you link):

> Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.

If you read the text of the decision (and the dissent) you'll see cogent arguments on both sides; nevertheless the fact it was a 5-4 split along political lines suggests the decision was entirely partisan and wholly unfounded in legal precedent -- and would have been so if the judges had ruled the other way.   Are all voters entitled to have their votes treated equally?  Of course.  Are all voters also entitled to have their *legal* votes properly counted, especially in cases where their votes might have been discarded for specious or politically-motivated reasons?  Also, of course.  The Equal Protection clause is a fuzzy metric that can be used to justify many different decisions -- much like nearly every other law, when you get down to it.

It may help to think of this as less about the number of votes and more a precedent-setting rubric to decide future elections.  Consider Florida 2000 to be a ""dead tie"" and the tie-breaking votes cast by the SCOTUS justices.  This tells political parties that the only way to win close elections in the future will be to control the Supreme Court -- along with, naturally, all of the other benefits that come from permitting or preventing certain legislation.",neodiogenes,,jszvus,gcc1vad

>Under then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act, which poured federal dollars into U.S. colleges and universities — and into students' pockets — all in the name of playing academic catch-up with the Soviets.

>Included in the legislation is one tightly packed sentence that says the government's appointed student loan commissioner (there was no education secretary back then) ""shall have the power to agree to modifications of agreements or loans made under this title and to compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, or demand, however arising or acquired under this title.""

>Put another way: The education secretary has the same kind of discretion as a criminal prosecutor, says Luke Herrine, a lawyer and Yale Law School Ph.D. student who has studied this authority extensively. (He's also a full-throated advocate for what he calls a ""student debt jubilee."")

The way I read this is SecEd would have the authority to forgive any loans issued under the NEDA. Since I doubt many loans outstanding are currently tied to the NEDA, the pathway to forgiveness would require DepEd to procure enough funding to refinance all the loans (~$1.5T-$1.6T) and set up a loan refinancing program that people would need to apply for and then SecEd could forgive from there.

,"The state of Georgia had a crisis in 1946 that we call ""The Three Governor's Controversy"" that some of y'all may find interesting. Basically the governor-elect, Eugene Talmadge, died after getting elected but before taking office and Georgia's constitution provided no clear guidance on how to select a new governor after such an event.

Talmadge's campaign knew Talmadge was sick and might die before taking office and they thought that if this happened that the Legislature would just choose between the runner up candidates. Since Talmadge ran unopposed, the campaign secretly organized an effort to write in Talmadge's son for a few hundred votes so that he would come in second place and the Georgia Legislature would just choose him. However, once Talmadge Sr. died the lieutenant governor-elect (Melvin Thompson) claimed that he should become Governor immediately after he was sworn in just like he would if the governor had died during his term. 

So the Legislature quickly elected Talmadge Jr. governor but the lieutenant governor-elect refused to accept the results and said that he was the rightful governor. Meanwhile, the outgoing governor (Ellis Arnall) stated that he would continue being governor until the state figured out who was going to be the actual governor. So three different men claimed to be governor and locked themselves up in various parts of the capitol. 

Eventually the sitting governor relinquished his claim and stated that the lieutenant governor-elect was the rightful governor, refusing to concede to Talmadge Jr. And the Legislature's claim. Then the Georgia Supreme Court came out and said that the Legislature had violated the state's constitution by electing Talmadge Jr, voided the results, and ordered that the lieutenant governor-elect be made governor until an emergency election for governor was held the following November. 

Talmadge Jr. ran against the lieutenant governor-elect in the democratic primaries, defeated him, and then won the general election a few months later to become the next governor anyway lol.

,"We have an incredibly strong *norm* in the United States of accepting the results of an election.  It's what keeps us a democracy.  There's no precedent for a president refusing to accept election results once they became clear, and there's no procedure in place to deal with this.  As Lawrence Douglas [has written](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Will_He_Go/I2i8DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22Our+Constitution+does+not+secure+the+peaceful+transition+of+power,+but+rather+presupposes+it%22&pg=PT24&printsec=frontcover):

>Our Constitution does not secure the peaceful transition of power, but rather presupposes it  The peaceful transition is a background condition of democratic governance, a condition created and maintained through tradition and norms.  A democracy cannot exist without leaders who respect these norms.

At the subnational level, the [three governors crisis](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/three-governors-controversy) in Georgia is the closest parallel.  Eugene Talmadge was elected Governor of Georgia in 1946, but he died before he could take office.  There were some ambiguities in the legal framework for this situation -- the Lieutenant Governor clearly became Governor if the Governor died, but it wasn't clear this applied to the Governor Elect.  Talmadge's allies in the state legislature therefore decided to choose a governor of their own and selected Eugene's son, Herman Talmadage.  Melvin Thompson, the lieutenant governor elect, claimed that he should become governor.  This chaos prompted outgoing governor Ellis Arnall to refuse to give up office.

From there, low level violence broke out between Arnall and Talmadge's supporters.  Talmadge had the support of the state police, who forcibly removed Arnall from his office.  Talmadge had the locks changed and seized physical control.  After this, Arnall gave up.  The courts eventually resolved the dispute between Thompson and Talmadge in Thompson's favor and Talmadge honored the ruling, but the disputed period did last about two months (January to March 1947).

To be honest, though, this doesn't provide a clear precedent for what we're going through now.  In a dispute over subnational office, the national government is still there to provide order and prevent violence.  It's different if the president launches a coup and refuses to go.

So what processes are there? None, really.  The laws are quite clear that the winner of the election becomes president, but if you've decided to seize power illegally, then laws aren't much of a constraint anymore.  Assuming that the person launching a coup has support from loyalists throughout the government, there's no clear constraint other than people taking to the streets or the military taking action.

The United States is the *only* [presidential democracy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/levitsky/files/1.1linz.pdf) in the world with a ""long history of constitutional continuity"" in the world.  Every other stable democracy has a parliamentary system.  Any president is a dictator in waiting.  For a couple of centuries, we've been lucky enough to have people of sufficient moral character to step aside when their time was up.  We've never really been tested, so this is the moment and I certainly hope we pass.

US history doesn't help us here, but there are much clearer parallels in [Latin America](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/523990-anxious-about-the-fate-of-americas-democracy-latin-america-offers).  If push really comes to shove, the military holds the cards to force an outcome.  In Honduras in 2009, the military forced President Manuel Zelaya to [step aside](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/29/world/americas/29honduras.html) and go into exile after he attempted to illegally remove term limits on the presidency.  That's arguably the ""good"" outcome but it got pretty rough.  

So, ultimately, if Trump refuses to go and manages to hold onto the support of people like McConnell and Barr, our fate lies in the hands of the military.",chadtr5,,js166s,gbyf858
,"No sitting US president has refused to give up office after an election, so there is no ""precedent"" as such.  There is only custom, with some backing in law, according to the[ timeline of events](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11641) from the Congressional Research Services.

Right now there's a lot of public rhetoric and private legal wrangling, but this matters only until three key dates:  December 8, December 14, and January 6.

**December 8 is the ""Safe Harbor"" deadline:**

> The U.S. Code (3 U.S.C. §5) provides that if election results are contested in any state, and if the state, prior to election day, has enacted procedures to settle controversies or contests over electors and electoral votes, and if these procedures have been applied, and the results have been determined six days before the electors’ meetings, then these results are considered to be conclusive, and will apply in the counting of the electoral votes. 

This seems to mean that, if recounts or legal challenges have not been resolved by this deadline, the currently counted numbers will stand, and Biden will have won a majority of electoral college votes.  

Note it was this deadline that finally gave Bush the win in 2000 -- the Supreme Court ruled that counting had to stop, even if many ballots were still in dispute.  This was also the point where Gore formally conceded, and, presumably, the point at which Trump *should* concede, again assuming no change in states' results.

**December 14, electors vote in their states:**

> Monday after the second Wednesday in December of presidential election years is set (3 U.S.C. §7) as the date on which the electors meet and vote  ... The electors count the results and then sign six certificates, each of which contains two lists, one of which includes the electoral votes for the President, the other, electoral votes for the Vice President, each of which includes the names of persons receiving votes and the number of votes cast for them. These are known as Certificates of the Vote, which the electors are required to sign.

There follows some procedures for sending these results to the various government offices responsible for sending them on to Washington, and while I suppose there is some opportunity for political legerdemain here, there are many copies and it would be difficult for one person to hold up the results, and certainly not without potential criminal penalties.

Historically, at this point the president-elect has been determined and the loser has long since conceded.  This year there is [considerable fear of faithless electors](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/10/21/can-the-electoral-college-be-subverted-by-faithless-electors/); however, ""faithless electors have never changed an election outcome,"" and [many states have laws restricting this possibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_elector#Faithless_elector_laws).

It's pure speculation what happens if there are numerous faithless electors that actually switch the results of the popular election, but mass demonstrations, worker's strikes, international condemnation, and political turmoil are all likely.

**January 6, 2021: Joint Session of Congress to Count Electoral Votes and Declare Election Results**

This is where things can get fun again:

> While the tellers announce the results, Members may object to the returns from any individual state as they are announced. Objections to individual state returns must be made in writing by at least one Member each of the Senate and House of Representatives.

However to be sustained and the votes discarded:

>  An objection to a state’s electoral vote must be approved by both houses

It's entirely possible we may see numerous objections slowing down the process, with the Senate approving and the House rejecting each, but again assuming the current vote counts stand and have been faithfully affirmed by electors, these objections should not change the outcome.

After this point, under the law Trump is no longer President after January 20, 2021.  Again we can only speculate what will happen if Trump refuses to leave the White House after this date, but it's important to recognize that it is difficult for any political coup to succeed without the strong support of numerous military leaders, and I can't see that Trump has done anything to endear that kind of fanatical loyalty.

But you never know.

Also, the White House is just a building.  If Biden is President, and Trump refuses to leave, then he is trespassing and subject to civil prosecution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit:  To quote Omar:  ""If you're going to come at the King, you best not miss.""  

State legislators know that if they do appoint a slate of electors who will vote contrary to the popular vote, there will be a serious backlash.  This can be mitigated if these votes have a chance of actually putting Trump in power.  

From what I have read, **they do not**.  There are simply not enough votes.

I can't see them throwing themselves on the fire needlessly.

I don't see any indication that Trump has an obligation to concede until he has exercised his right to investigate anything questionable, but it has to be done by December 8th.

,"The Cabinet is very different than the Supreme Court, and there's a reduced incentive to block nominees.  Once appointed, a Supreme Court justice is independent and holds office for life.  Cabinet members serve as the pleasure of the president, and the president is legally entitled to direct them to take whatever otherwise lawful actions he chooses.

If the Senate won't confirm nominees, then Biden will necessarily have to depend on acting officials, but I think there are some important misconceptions about acting officials.  There's a *very* important difference between Trump's ability to use acting officials and Biden's hypothetical ability to do so.

Under the [Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44997.pdf), three types of people can serve in an otherwise Senate confirmed capacity on an acting basis:

1. The first assistant (generally the deputy secretary if there is one).  Because, in almost all cases, these are themselves Senate confirmed positions, you must be able get your nominees confirmed to something in order to get them into office in this way.
2. Someone confirmed to another position in the federal government by the Senate (again if the Senate blocks all nominees, then this path is closed).
3. A senior officer or employee of the agency (who does not need to be in a Senate confirmed position) if they held that position for at least 90 days **before** the vacancy.  

This leaves no path for Biden to install the people of his choosing into acting positions.  President Trump has been able to make unprecedented use of acting officials to bypass the Senate but only because he initially had a Senate confirmed Cabinet, allowing him to put people of his choosing in the relevant positions to assume Cabinet posts in an acting capacity.  When has failed to abide by the FVRA, courts have struck down the appointments -- for example, leading to the invalidation of regulations issued by the invalidly appointed [Ken Cucinelli](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/811023475/judge-says-ken-cuccinelli-was-appointed-unlawfully-to-top-immigration-post).

So, if the Senate is dead-set on obstruction, then there's no way for Biden to put the people of his choice in Cabinet posts.  But, does he really need to?  In the event of complete Senate obstruction, the FVRA still gives Biden a fair amount of latitude via #3.  ""Senior"" is defined in this context as GS-15 or higher pay grades (essentially SES employees).  That's [5%](https://ourpublicservice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/abd589d0e0dcd9336101e81858a0d2f6-1399994024.pdf) of the total federal workforce.  Given that, it's fair to imagine that there's someone, somewhere at GS-15 or higher in every agency who could be installed as a reasonably suitable Cabinet officer.

The president also has total authority to select the White House staff without Senate confirmation.  Crucial roles like White House Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor do not require confirmation.  Presidents commonly appoint [""czars""](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/what-exactly-does-a-government-czar-do/439371/) on the White House staff who coordinate policy areas.  

Hypothetically, if the Senate will not confirm anyone, President Biden could appoint a ""czar"" on the White House staff corresponding to each Cabinet position.  So, for example, a ""Diplomacy Czar"" corresponding to the Secretary of State.  Then, he could select some GS-15 or SES employee of the relevant agency to serve as the figurehead acting secretary with the understanding that this person's role is solely to legally implement the wishes of the ""Diplomacy Czar"" and that they will be immediately fired if they ever disobey a directive.  This would be a clunky workaround, but it would functionally accomplish the same thing as a Cabinet of the president's choosing.

If the Senate fails to actually hold a vote and reject the appointment, that silence should be taken as implied consent and the appointment shall take place.

The whole tradition of the President making an appointment and the Senate having hearings and a vote to confirm as a requirement before the appointee seems to be just that, a tradition.

Now if we go back and look at the original cabinet members nominated by Trump, several received zero votes from the opposition party, and several more only got low single digits.

If you go back and read what Democrats were saying about those candidates that they didn't support, their statements fall very clearly within the realm of, ""or ones who are controversial with ~~conservatives~~ liberals"".

My conclusion, you might not like it, but this is quite precedented.  What will happen is Biden will nominate more middle of the road by slightly left leaning Democrats, and someone like Warren will need to wait before becoming Education Secretary.

,"This is truly a political question. Presidents typically enter with a [mandate](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/presidential-mandates-arent-real-but-congress-sometimes-acts-as-if-they-are/) based on their status as someone who just won a nationwide election from the people. So politically it is dangerous to obstinately oppose the newly elected President. This is politically very different from obstinately opposing an outgoing President near the end of his terms, which happens more often.

Politically speaking, if Republicans simply refuse to approve any new cabinet members, they'd be clearly seen as opposing the will of the people, and would start seeing some of their own members who want to be re-elected break with the party.

What's more likely early in a term is that the Senate would oppose a small handful of the President's nominees, labeling their views as extremist. In fact, [that's exactly what OP's link states](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mcconnell-reportedly-eyes-constraints-possible-biden-cabinet-picks-n1246581) \- not that they'd oppose the entire cabinet.

,"The Constitution gives the State Legislatures broad power to define the ""time, place, and manner"" of elections.  It allows for modification of those regulations by Congress.

The arguments made by the Trump campaign will largely boil down to two categories:

1.  State actors didn't follow the regulations defined by the State Legislatures
2.  State and Federal courts don't have the authority to modify election regulations.

The first category will be straight forward. They did or didn't. There's evidence or there isn't. The effects were material or they weren't. I would not expect anything meaningful to come out of these since no credible source is reporting massive voting irregularities.

The second category is more interesting and may be what reaches the Supreme Court again. The court has so far sidestepped making a broad interpretation but does seem inclined to hear more.

,"I'm going to comment mainly on this:

> Beyond the ruling, are there secondary benefits/consequences associated with filing these lawsuits?

I think that the Trump campaign's strategy here is to cast doubt on the validity of the process and the results. To make the republican base think that the election was stolen, or at least doubt the full integrity, and thus to give them something to hang on to and rally around for the next election.

This has received some reports, e.g.

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-lawsuits/trump-lawsuits-unlikely-to-impact-outcome-of-u-s-election-experts-say-idUSKBN27L2IB):

> “The litigation looks more like an effort to allow Trump to continue rhetorically attempting to delegitimize an electoral loss,” said Joshua Geltzer, a professor at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy & Protection.

Another political science professor has echoed the same idea, Dr Aaron Houck has been quoted in several places (

This piece from [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-campaigns-election-fraud-claims-arent-really-designed-to-win-in-court-01604875368) suggests (rather realistically, I'd say) that the point for Trump isn't actually to gather evidence and present it in order to demonstrate the truth of his claims.

Obama's second term was very obstructed by republicans, so he mostly had to focus on foreign affairs and executive actions to get anything done. This is especially frustrating because he was interested in finding overlap to work with republican, but was soundly rejected in those efforts.

For 2016 data, NPA and ""Minor"" parties are combined into a single ""Other"" category, so for quick comparisons, I did the same with 2020 data. FWIW, in 2017, Minors had around 65k and in 2020, 188k.

These numbers are accurate as of August 31st, 2020.  The last month Florida DoS reported before the books closed.  Registration in Florida closed on October 5th, so it's unknown with this data how many registered in September.

,"For: The carry of firearms is a longstanding American practice. 

>From our review of founding-era sources, we conclude that this natural meaning was also the meaning that “bear arms” had in the 18th century. In numerous instances, “bear arms” was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. The most prominent examples are those most relevant to the Second Amendment: Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens to “bear arms in defense of themselves and the state” or “bear arms in defense of himself and the state.” [Footnote 8] It is clear from those formulations that “bear arms” did not refer only to carrying a weapon in an organized military unit. Justice James Wilson interpreted the Pennsylvania Constitution’s arms-bearing right, for example, as a recognition of the natural right of defense “of one’s person or house”—what he called the law of “self preservation.” 2 Collected Works of James Wilson 1142, and n. x (K. Hall & M. Hall eds. 2007) (citing Pa. Const., Art. IX, §21 (1790)); see also T. Walker, Introduction to American Law 198 (1837) (“Thus the right of self-defence [is] guaranteed by the [Ohio] constitution”); see also id., at 157 (equating Second Amendment with that provision of the Ohio Constitution). That was also the interpretation of those state constitutional provisions adopted by pre-Civil War state courts.[Footnote 9] These provisions demonstrate—again, in the most analogous linguistic context—that “bear arms” was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia.

The carrying of a gun (pistol in holster, safe carry of a long gun) is not a threat of violence. It's the same as saying someone who carries a knife to a polling place must want to threaten people, even though that is rarely, if ever, the case. This is a negative claim: I have never heard of a case of someone being charged or convicted for brandishing a firearm in a holster or a long arm carried responsibly if that activity is legal.

Against: Polling locations often are located in sensitive places (schools, government buildings, etc), and the Supreme court in Heller reaffirmed the prohibition of carrying weapons in those areas.

,"> Legal: Given that the administration is getting sued, how legal is the order, and how true is the NTEU's lawsuit wordings about the order?

That's a bit of a doozie. In so far as I can tell, the President's actions are (relatively) unprecedented, so the NTEU's suit is as well. Their [complaint](https://www.nteu.org/~/media/Files/nteu/docs/public/schedulef/schfeocomplaint.pdf?la=en) relies on 5 U.S.C. §3302, which [states that](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3302):

> The President may prescribe rules governing the competitive service. The rules shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for— (1) necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service; and (2) necessary exceptions from the provisions of sections 2951, 3304(a), 3321, 7202, and 7203 of this title.

To clarify, the issue has to do with two types of Executive employees: those who serve in the ""competitive service"" and those in ""excepted service"". The competitive service follows all of the regulatory rules designed by the Office of Personnel Management which give protections against politically motivated hirings and firings, allow the employee to be promoted, and which designate who can even be hired by the government in the first place. But, there are cases where a federal agency needs to be more flexible in hiring and firing decisions. For example, the CIA has its own rules about hiring because they want to vet people for a year or more before bringing them in on the nation's secrets. Likewise, a lot of agency attorneys are in the excepted service because they needed to be hired to fill some niche, often temporary, role that the regular process wouldn't be good at filling. Therefore, [about half of all federal jobs are in the excepted service](https://www.fedsmith.com/2010/11/28/federal-job-classifications-competitive-vs-excepted/).

The President's order essentially takes anyone in the **competitive** service “in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating positions” and gives them their own **excepted** service category (""Schedule F""). This strips the protections they enjoy as members of the protected service against politically motivated hirings and firings. This is where we get the accusation that they are being turned into ""at-will employees."" The stated purpose of the Executive Order is to make the federal bureaucracy more efficient by allowing more flexibility in hiring and firing decisions. The legal issue is whether the President has been given the authority by Congress to do so.

As far as I can tell, 5 U.S.C. §3302 has neither been used nor litigated in this way. There's only a few noteworthy cases, including *US ex rel Crow v. Mitchell*, 89 F.2d 805 (App. D.C. 1937), in which the DC Court of appeals found, in part, that because the statute is a little vague about what authority Congress gave to the President, the courts should defer to the President more often than not. But *Mitchell* concerned a rule change about a single federal agency, the FCC, and not the entire federal workforce. There is also *National Treasury Employees Union v. Horner* 654 F.Supp. 1159 (App. D.C. 1987), which clarifies that decisions about re-categorizing federal employees are indeed subject to judicial review.

But that's about it. I can't find anything about politically motivated decisions at all. In their argument, the NTEU cites *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* for the proposition that the President's actions are contrary to the express and limited delegation of authority given by Congress. That's a nice, flashy start, but it doesn't help us understand much about this case because of the lack of relevant precedent.

There may also be a threshold question of standing that the NTEU has to get beyond before their suit can proceed (on the theory that their injury is too generalized), but it's hard to say. That's also not the same issue as whether or not the order itself is legal.

Without pouring much much more work into this and doing the DoJ's job for them, the best I can do is say that this order may or may not be legal. Sorry. We're still in the murky legal waters of the Trump Presidency, in which the conclusion in important cases is often: ""Who knows? Call me back in two years.""

As always anyone with a different perspective or information is free to correct me.

Edited because words are hard.",HomeAliveIn45,,jk8v36,gahw4rc
,"Please let me start by saying that this is a *very* big deal.  Personnel policy is not ""sexy"" and gets little attention, but this has the potential to fundamentally reshape the federal government.

The vast majority of positions in the federal government are staffed on an apolitical, merit basis.  There are [about 9,000](https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/presidential-transition-directory/federal-government-structure/plum-book) positions in the federal government that can be filled on a political basis instead at present.  This includes the high profile positions you associate with political leadership (e.g., the Cabinet, agency leaders) as well as the considerably larger body of ""Schedule C"" positions.  Schedule C includes ""confidential or policy-determining"" positions.  Take a look, for example, at the Schedule C positions in the [Department of Education](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016-8-6.pdf) for a sense of what this includes: mostly policy advisors to senior leadership, confidential assistants, some attorneys and so on.

The [federal personnel system](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rnqz) balances two needs: competence/expertise (achieved through competitive, merit-based appointment) vs. political control (achieved through politicized appointments -- at worst, these might also amount to patronage).  In the nineteenth century, the U.S. had an ineffective and highly politicized civil service -- in the intervening years, the federal bureaucracy has become much more efficient and effective by allowing political appointments only at the very top levels, ensuring competence for all other positions.

A substantial body of scholarship shows that federal agencies perform *much* better when led by career management.  The [more political appointees](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rnqz.11?refreqid=excelsior%3A3c89bec7610756ac50f2c541884dff82&seq=9#metadata_info_tab_contents) in an agency, the worse its performance is.  Politicization has also been used as a deliberate strategy to prevent agencies from performing effectively, and it's not hard to imagine that this is President Trump's goal.  Politicization also [makes it much harder](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4620105) to attract talented career managers, who recognize that they will have limited opportunities as professionals.

That's a long wind up, but the point is that we are talking about something very important here.  We don't know yet how many positions will be placed on ""Schedule F,"" thereby politicizing them, but the executive order explicitly applies to:

>career professionals in positions **that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition**

So let's be clear that the explicit goal of the policy is to politicize new areas of federal service.  The new policy allows for non-competitive, politically-biased hiring of:

>career positions in the Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character

Contrast this to Schedule C, which only impacts positions of a ""policy-determining"" character, and it's clearly much broader.  The Office of Personnel Management has now provided more specific guidance on the matter.  According to the guidance, the [following ](https://www.chcoc.gov/content/instructions-implementing-schedule-f) characteristics place a position on Schedule F (my numbering):

1. *""*Substantive participation in the advocacy for or development or formulation of policy*""*
2. ""the supervision of attorneys""
3. ""substantial discretion to determine the manner in which the agency exercises functions committed to the agency by law""
4. ""viewing, circulating, or otherwise working with proposed regulations, guidance, executive orders, or other non-public policy proposals or deliberations generally covered by deliberative process privilege""
5. ""conducting, on the agency’s behalf, collective bargaining negotiations""

It will take a while for agencies to determine who falls into those categories, but look at how enormous those are.

I also want to emphasize the importance of #2 if it's taken literally.  One of the central threats posed by the Trump administration has been its politicization of the Justice Department and the administration of criminal justice.  On its face, Schedule F would transform *every* manager in the Justice Department into a political appointee, making it impossible for the Justice system to maintain any kind of independence.  

FedWeek [suggests](https://www.fedweek.com/fedweek/trump-orders-shifting-policy-related-jobs-into-excepted-service/) we're talking about ""tens of thousand to 100,000 or more"" positions and that sounds right to me.  So on the low end, we're talking about doubling or tripling the number of political positions in the executive branch.  At the high end, this could increase politicization by a factor of ten or more.

This would be the largest change to the structure of the federal government in over a century.  As the saying goes, ""personnel is policy.""  These changes *matter*.  If you extrapolate out from existing studies (see above) of the impacts of politicization, this might look like something along the lines of a 20-30% reduction in the performance of the federal government across the board.",chadtr5,,jk8v36,gai9qpl
,"Almost [any position could be defined ](https://www.govexec.com/management/2020/10/stunning-executive-order-would-politicize-civil-service/169479/) as “policy influencing”.   

What this will do is give Trump, or a president like him, the ability to fire government scientists who release reports about topics such as climate change or pandemic control.  He could also fire career employees in the agencies to try to point out to him or his messengers that an action they want to take is illegal or unethical.   On the plus side, though, the Executive Order is really badly written which will give OPM a chance to drag their heels on implementation while everyone debates what various sentences mean.   Here’s a [good explanation of the OPM process that will push the application of this executive order out past the election. ](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2020/10/new-executive-order-may-reclassify-wide-swaths-of-career-positions-as-political-appointees/)",Ocean2731,,jk8v36,gahl216
,"Not sure on numbers impacted but to the second and third question because they are linked: 

It does essentially create ""at-will"" employment where employees under this designation can be fired at any time for any (legal) reason. I note ""legal"" because you cannot fire someone, for example, because of a legally protected status under federal discrimination laws like their race, religion, gender, etc. 

Labor laws have typically been fairly clear about the distinction between classified and exempted, supervisorial staff. The latter are often called ""management and confidential"" as a shorthand. Trump's EO seeks to place more employees into this type of status. 

Most state laws that allow for unionization allow labor relations boards and legislatures to set reasonable rules for what constitutes a management and confidential position. The NLRB is the federal level labor relations board and it can be highly influenced by executive appointment (see some of the asinine things going on there since Trump was elected). The NLRA and Taft-Hartley (booo!) are the guiding laws for the NLRB and federal courts when examining these questions. 

On the surface, this EO seems to go beyond established designations in a unilateral executive push to strip workers of legal protections. In that sense I think the lawsuit stands a good chance...except the construction of the federal judiciary, and indeed the scotus itself, has become increasingly anti-labor in recent decisions. That could factor heavily against the workers.

,"Legal residence-Permanent. Legal residency is not defined in law. However, over the years, the courts 
and the Florida Department of State/Division of Elections’ have construed legal residency to be where a 
person mentally intends to make his or her permanent residence.

1 Evidence of such intent can come 
from items or activities such as obtaining a Florida driver’s license

2, paying tax receipts, paying bills for 
residency (light, water, garbage service) and receiving mail at address, claiming the property as 
homestead,

3 declaring the county as domicile, and doing other activities indicative or normally associated with home life. Therefore, legal residence is a convergence of intent and fact. Once residency is established for voting purposes, it is presumptively valid or current until evidence shows otherwise.  See Op. Atty Gen. Fla. 055-216 (August 26, 1955). A business address is not typically a satisfactory legal residential address but if the person resides there despite the zoning ordinance, the address could 
become the person’s legal residential address.

,"That's a fascinating article but it doesn't really prompt the exact question you're asking. According to the article, Trump has a long history with the town and county of Palm Beach and his neighbors there, and he upset the applecart by declaring Mar-a-Lago as his residence:

> ... Trump agreed in writing years ago to change the use of the Mar-a-Lago property from a single-family residence to a private club owned by a corporation he controls.

> The distinction is significant. The property is taxed as a private club — not as a residence, according to Palm Beach County property appraiser records. Trump’s own attorney assured local officials in Palm Beach before they voted to approve the club in 1993 that he would not live there. Mar-a-Lago’s website says only that Trump maintains “private quarters” at the club.

> “It’s one or the other — it’s a club or it’s your home,” Reginald Stambaugh, an attorney who represents a neighbor opposed to Trump’s dock plan, said in a recent interview. “You can’t have it both ways.”

> If Stambaugh and his client have their way and persuade Palm Beach to stand firm on its long-standing agreement, Trump will be forced to make a choice, he said: Stop operating Mar-a-Lago as a club and make it a single-family home again or change his official domicile to someplace else.

If you read on there's quite a bit more detail. But the gist isn't that Trump's eligibility as a voter is in question after he registered with Mar-a-Lago as his residence; it's that declaring Mar-a-Lago as his official residence reopened these other legal wounds.",Epistaxis,,ji8yez,ga5ulw2

If Trump is claiming to live at Mar A Lago, then that's his place of residence, and is registered at that address, then that's his place of residence as far as the state of Florida is concerned.

The Government has broad powers that can be brought to bear in the event of an emergency, especially during a pandemic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF8MswEQS7w)  [Mask mandates are a very mild response compared to what is possible under the law](https://www.wired.com/story/what-government-emergency-declarations-can-and-cant-do-in-a-pandemic/).

,"The most promising strategy for this would be to require states to issue mask mandates as a condition of receiving Federal funding.  The [HEROES Act](https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/how-much-would-each-state-receive-through-the-coronavirus-state-fiscal#:~:text=Under%20the%20Heroes%20Act%2C%20states,billion%20by%20May%203%2C%202021.) which [passed the House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6800/actions) would allocate $500 billion to state governments for COVID relief.  Congress could require that to receive some or all of that money, the states would have to enact a face covering law that met certain criteria.  

Because this would be money for a new program involving no prior state/Federal agreement, the feds would be more-or-less unconstrained in how strict the rules were to qualify for the money, at least if the Supreme Court is at all consistent with past precedent in [South Dakota v. Dole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_v._Dole) and [NFIB v. Sebelius.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius)

The second most promising strategy would be to target businesses, especially larger businesses that operate across state lines.  Such a law might not be able to reach independent stores and restaurants, but would be able to reach [most major supermarkets](https://www.statista.com/statistics/818602/online-and-offline-grocery-market-share-of-leading-grocery-retailers-us/) and brand-name retailers.  

If you wanted to go a third route, Congress could give direct grant or loan aid to businesses that adopted certain mask policies independent of federal or state law.  This could even go as far as paying certain extremely high risk businesses like bars to remain closed. 

The downside to the second and third routes is that because they would not capture all businesses, people who wanted to engage in high-risk activity like drinking in bars or who object to mask wearing would possibly just do so at the businesses where it was possible, and still causing community spread, and the attendant sickness and death.",huadpe,,jha3f1,g9xg2rw

,"> like interstate highways

That didn't sound right - people on interstate highways are presumably mostly inside their own cars, not exposed to one another - so I [looked it up](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2782P6). There wasn't any more about Biden's plan but there's a lot of background information about previous discussions of this option:

> Reuters reported in July that administration officials had held extensive talks about whether the Health and Human Services Department should issue an order requiring masks at U.S. airports, train and transit stations and onboard airplanes, trains and transit services before opting not to proceed.

> In July, the White House opposed legislation that sought to mandate all airline, train and public transit passengers and workers wear masks, saying it was “overly restrictive.” It added that “such decisions should be left to states, local governments, transportation systems, and public health leaders.”

> Earlier this month, the U.S. Transportation Department rejected a petition that sought a mask mandate at airports and for U.S. airlines, saying the department believes “there should be no more regulations than necessary.”

It sounds like the conversation has been mainly about interstate air travel and train routes, not cars on highways. The article also mentions public transit, which seems more likely to be municipal than interstate, but that's in the context of new legislation rather than an executive department's existing regulatory power.

The article also notes that what Biden seems to be proposing has already been implemented by some transportation providers themselves:

> Airlines, U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak and most public transit systems and U.S. airports require all passengers and workers to wear facial coverings, as do ride-sharing firms Uber UBER.N and Lyft LYFT.O.

,"Yes, they absolutely canimpose a mandate. But... No, a federal mandate is not REALLY something that could be done, from a realistic pov. They can write a law and try to force states to listen, but states can do what ever they want with it. Imagine the impotence of making a law and half the states ignore you? It would ruin your credibility, or you would have to flex your power pretty hard against people who don't want you flexing.

What the feds can do is deny funding for jurisdictions that dont comply: its why you see gun free schools ^1 in most areas, but not all ^2 . Under homeland security, they could mandate masks on ""transportation"" and as witnessed by the VIPR raids in 2005-now transportation includes highways, sidewalks, streets, trains, etc. ^3 

BUT, it would have to be enforced: if local law enforcement won't enforce it, there is no enforcement. Other cases have shown that flouting federal law is basically free of consequences, aside from some threats and suits, ignoring federal law continues. ^4 In fact, to conduct federal operations to punish people who don't comply, a mayor or other official could warn people the feds are on their way, and not be subject to obstruction. ^5

There is also the problem that some Governors have already threatened war over federalized covid policies including quarantining states that show significant problems. ^6 I believe that wouldn't be an isolated response to a federal policy dictating health standards to states. It is also worth noting that the same Governor threatened states that targeted his states citizens for quarantine ^7 despite enacting the exact same policy targeting other states ^8 . That makes it clear to me that there would be massive pushback from states against the federal government authority, and other states authority, and basically no recourse. 

So, basically, the feds can mandate what they want, but most of it is only meaningfully enforceable through funding threats and direct action (like waco, or ruby ridge, or ICE, etc). Unless you have buy in from the populations,, you don't have a real mandate. , Weed laws are a similar issue. We already had state governments threatening war over this, and while it amazes me that few remember that, and I would be sad to see it, I would expect similar statements and flouting from other states if any federal action was taken.

,"According to the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, the answer is absolute - NO (yet ANOTHER reason why Biden has no business being the President).

Tenth Amendment: "" The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. ""

Thus, it is now meaningful to speak of “Tenth Amendment doctrine.” Any case that involves action by the federal government that in some way regulates, or commands, state governments, such as by telling states what policies they must adopt, are nullified by this Amendment.

Biden's statements suggesting he will become ""above"" the Constitutional laws of the United States are ludicrous, at best. As far as requiring masks for entrance into Federally owned facility, he can probably enforce that. But ""coercing"" Governors into compliance by ""ask(ing) every governor to institute mask mandates and, if they refused,  working with local officials to get local mandates in place nationwide""? UNCONSTITUTIONAL. And I would hope that ANY Governor faced with this man's ridiculous ""mandates"" would take it to the Supreme Court for their opinion as they will most likely laugh him out of the room.

>Now, after months of outcry on social media from critics of AB 5, the newly signed AB 2257 (also authored by assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez) exempts more occupations and frees freelance content contributors from the 35 submission limit.

1. The federal portion of the [Medicaid expansion](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/) disappears in states that expanded it. 

2. The [subsidies for those making <400% above poverty level](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/subsidized-coverage/) go away.

3. Requirement that insurers must cover [preventive care](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/), including birth control and immunizations, goes away.

4. Insurers can [exclude children](https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/children-under-26/) over the age of 18 from their parents' policies.

5. The Medicare donut hole comes back; [Medicare costs go up](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/what-are-the-implications-of-repealing-the-affordable-care-act-for-medicare-spending-and-beneficiaries/) for the government and for beneficiaries.

6. [Insurers will be able to deny coverage](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/pre-existing-conditions/) to those with preexisting conditions again.

7. Out-of-[pocket maximums go away](https://www.cigna.com/employers-brokers/insights/informed-on-reform/cost-sharing). Insurers can choose to cover costs to a certain amount, then the patient is obligated to pay everything that goes over the amount.

8. The number of employers offering health insurance will probably go down--the ACA penalizes [employers with >50 employees](https://www.kff.org/infographic/employer-responsibility-under-the-affordable-care-act/) that do not offer insurance.




9. Approximately[ 30 million people will lost their healt](https://www.epi.org/aca-obamacare-repeal-impact/)h insurance, and a million or more jobs could be lost.

9. The way hospitals and providers are [paid was changed by the ACA](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/journal-article/2020/feb/aca-at-10-years-changed-health-care-delivery-payment). I have no guess as to what will happen if those changes go up in smoke.

Costs of policies for healthy people will probably go down, but then again, those policies have fewer benefits and protections than policies under ACA regulations.

From that report, a pre-existing condition could be something like arthritis, asthma, high cholesterol, hypertension, or obesity. I want to draw your attention to Obesity there, because that's something that's changed since the ACA went into affect. According to Trust for America's Healthy, ""The U.S. adult obesity rate stands at 42.4 percent, the first time the national rate has passed the 40 percent mark, and further evidence of the country’s obesity crisis.

Basically, if the ACA was repealed entirely, it might be that insurance companies could refuse to cover about half the population of the United States just based on obesity. You might also be denied coverage for a pre-existing condition. An example of this, limited by my personal understanding, is that you could potentially be insured, receive a cancer diagnoses, and then be refused insurance coverage because your insurance company researched your past medical records to determine you had a pre-existing condition. 

Pre-ACA there were some protections for this through HIPAA, but it looks like they were focused on employer based plans. HIPAA ""limits what’s considered a pre-existing condition. An employer health plan can exclude a medical condition from coverage only if the person had a gap in coverage longer than 63 days, and also had or was recommended to have treatment or medical advice in the 6 months before enrolling in the plan.""

That's not a full report, but they do have their references on the page. 

I remembered that President Trump said that he signed an executive order regarding pre-existing conditions, but it looks like the text of that doesn't actually \*order\* anyone to do anything. ""It has been and will continue to be the policy of the United States to give Americans seeking healthcare more choice, lower costs, and better care and to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates."" 

It looks like that's just a statement of intent. It doesn't say, order insurance companies to continue to protect people if the ACA is repealed. I would guess that the executive order would have no legal power at all. 

You can read the executive order here: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-america-first-healthcare-plan/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-america-first-healthcare-plan/) 

This article has some expert opinions on it: [https://khn.org/news/trumps-executive-order-on-preexisting-conditions-lacks-teeth-experts-say/](https://khn.org/news/trumps-executive-order-on-preexisting-conditions-lacks-teeth-experts-say/)

Altogether, I would say that it would give Insurance Companies overwhelming power over who they cover, how much they cover, and when they cover anything at all. Every American would seemingly have a coin flip of whether they could buy insurance at a reasonable rate, and then have to suffer that coin flip again if the insurance company doesn't want to pay for something. I think insurance companies may have the power to do things like search through your social media to determine if alcoholism, anxiety, or obesity would apply as pre-existing conditions, because the law has not had to adapt to that possibility since 2010.

I'm being a bit optimistic with regards to calling a coin flip by the way. The first article I quoted states: ""Older Americans between ages 55 and 64 are at particular risk: 48 to 86 percent of people in that age bracket have some type of pre-existing condition.  And 15 to 30 percent of people in perfectly good health today are likely to develop a pre-existing condition over the next eight years, severely limiting their choices without the protections of the Affordable Care Act.""",Zagmit,,jebt8l,g9dvir7

Basically, the ACA allocated $1 billion a year to a group to fund research into ways to provide healthcare more cheaply without sacrificing quality of care.

,"It ultimately depends on why the court rules that ACA is unconstitutional. The actual case ([California v. Texas](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-840.html))is appealing the [Conclusion (p. 55)](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aca.pdf) that “For the reasons stated above, the Court grants Plaintiffs partial summary judgment and declares the Individual Mandate, 26 U.S.C. § 5000A(a), UNCONSTITUTIONAL. Further, the Court declares the remaining provisions of the ACA, Pub. L. 111-148, are INSEVERABLE and therefore INVALID. The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief in Count I of the Amended Complaint.”
The “reasons” that led to this ruling are as follows: 

1. “in NFIB, the Supreme Court held the Individual Mandate was unconstitutional under the Interstate Commerce Clause but could fairly be read as an exercise of Congress’s Tax Power because it triggered a tax.” -> this was the Supreme Court decision that ruled that ACA was Constitutional because it was a valid exercise in Congress’s power of taxation.

2. However, Texas filed a suit claiming that because “the TCJA [Trump’s tax cut] eliminated that tax” by revoking the individual mandate, this is no longer the case. The court (specifically, District Judge Reed O'Connor) stated that “Individual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause—meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional."" 

3. This determination caused the court to agree with Texas that the law cannot be considered taxation without that specific clause (presumably because that clause is the only part of the bill that qualifies it as a tax). It therefore ruled that it is unconstitutional of Congress to impose such a bill, since the original premise of it is no longer valid.

Ultimately, if the court agrees that the removal of the Individual Mandate does in fact mean that ACA is no longer qualified to be considered an exercise in Congress’s tax power, then the most likely outcome is that Congress will have to amend the act in such a way that it CAN fall under the Congress’s tax power. Assuming they can quickly come to a consensus about how this is done, there will be no discernible effect on the coverage of those who rely on it. 

It will also certainly not have an effect on any of the other government programs (which many people are claiming) because there is no case to be made that these programs aren’t put in place under Congress’s powers of taxation (for example, there is no suit currently claiming as much, and it would most likely not be accepted if it was, because these laws are clearly within the purview of taxation). It’s just fear mongering that is not based on any legal validation.",Ksais0,,jebt8l,g9gig49

* Each ballot has a serial number.  If someone makes 100 copies of my ballot, or even 1, and attempts to vote with it, it won't be processed because I already received that particular ballot. 

* Unserialized or improperly serialized ballots not tied to a voter would be thrown out.

* If you don't receive your ballot by a certain date, you can request a new one, and the other ballot, if it is swimming around in the mail system or sitting in a ditch somewhere, would no longer be a valid ballot.

Assuming that both the NYT and Donald Trump are correct, then the implications, let alone those for national security, are minimal at best.  If Trump is truly underleveraged, then he could just roll over the debt.

For example, [Occidental Petroleum is extremely overleveraged](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OXY) - its long term debt is worth several times the company's market value.

While what really matters is whether or not Trump is [solvent](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/solvency/), one would imagine with so much more in assets, he could just sell one of his properties and easily pay off all $400 million of that debt.

Personally I don't see the [politifact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/may/07/viral-image/fact-checking-joe-biden-hunter-biden-and-ukraine/) article as proving anything. But it does make certain statements I believe are crucial.

>Hunter Biden told the New York Times this month in a statement that ""at no time have I discussed with my father the company’s business, or my board service, including my initial decision to join the board.""

Based purely on these statements lets evaluate this:

>Hunter Biden introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company, according to emails obtained by The Post.

These statements are not in conflict. Even if Hunter introduced his father to a Burisma executive, that is not evidence of anything. The Bidens said Hunter never discussed company information, nor did he know Hunter worked for Burisma.

To put this in plain english, Hunter introduced his father to someone he worked with, Joe didn't know he worked with him, nor did he know anything else about the individual.

That is all this part says. That is not proof of a conspiracy, nor is it vindication because it *could* be part of something else.

Recounting a trip to Kyiv in late 2015, Biden described telling the then-president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, that he had to fire the prosecutor general or the US would not release $1 billion in loan guarantees. “I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,’” Biden told the crowd, taking a long look at his watch for effect. “‘If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’ Well, son of a bitch.” Here the audience laughed. “He got fired.”

Whether he was lying about the timeline is another interesting aspect, as various outlets have pointed out that it wasn't a 6 hour affair, but probably took place between late 2015 and December 2015. The most probable time he would have forced Poroshenko's hand was in his 2015 visit to Ukraine.

There is also the matter of the disinformation spread that Shokin was the one who stalled the EU's investigation into Zlochevsky's assets, although George Kent's testimony has been linked in another comment which puts the blame on Shokin's predecessor for that move.

Perhaps the strongest (or weakest) evidence comes in the form of Shokin's actions themselves, Shokin reportedly seized Zlochevsky's assets in February of 2016:

and later swore under oath that he was fired due to investigating Burisma and Hunter Biden in particular.

[https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/427618359-Shokin-Statement-1.pdf](https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/427618359-Shokin-Statement-1.pdf)

If Biden's original claim was true, that he called Poroshenko and within 6 hours had Shokin fired, then this would be an especially troubling claim, since such a call would have occurred in the short weeks following Shokin's seizure of Hunter Biden's boss' assets. Kent's testimony also indicates that Hunter's position elicited at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.

In addition, there is the issue of the optics of the whole deal that Biden struck. One could easily understand how Soviet Bloc countries have had issues of corruption plaguing them over the last 20 years. Any reasonable person could understand how Biden would think that witholding 1,000,000,000 in loan guarantees would be worth ridding the Ukraine PGO of corruption, but it doesn't explain why Lutsenko, Poroshenko's next PGO head, was later fired due to his own corruption, while Biden claimed he was a ""solid at the time"".

If the allegations in the NYP article are true, all this is especially worrying since Biden claimed that he never talked to his son about Burisma: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/21/joe-biden-never-talked-ukraine-son-trump-needs-investigated/2401830001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/21/joe-biden-never-talked-ukraine-son-trump-needs-investigated/2401830001/)

By all accounts, unless Giuliani is pulling a fast one and risking his career over this, it appears that the NYP story is true for the most part, as Giuliani even claimed yesterday that Hunter's lawyer sent him an email and gave him a call asking for the hard drive back, all while the Biden campaign has not refuted the veracity of the evidence itself, only that Biden didn't meet with Hunter's business partner as stated, though they have conceded it is possible that Biden did meet him in an informal setting, further walking back Biden's first point mentioned above.

""Hope, you are well. Thank you for the docs provided. I have analyzed them most carefully and came up with the following observations: the first thing is that the suggested scope of work is largely lacking concrete tangible results that we set out to achieve in the first place, mostly focusing on the process. **Also, it doesn't offer any names of top US officials here in Ukraine (for instance, US Ambassador) or Ukrainian officials (the President of Ukraine, chief of staff, Prosecutor General) as key targets for improving Nikolay's case** and his situation in Ukraine. If, however, this is done deliberatly to be on the safe and cautious side, I can understand the rationale. And if all parties in fact understand the true purpose of the BS engagement and all our joint efforts, it's ok and we should proceed immediately. My only concern is for us to be on the same page re our final goals. With this in mind, **I would like us to formulate a list of deliverables, including, but not limited to: a concrete course of actions, incl. meetings/communications resulting in high-ranking US officials in Ukraine (US Ambassador) and in US publicly or in private communication/comment expressing their ""positive opinion"" and support of Nikolay/Burisma to the highest level of decision makers here in Ukraine :President of Ukraine, president Chief of staff, Prosecutor General, etc**  The scope of work should also include organization of a visit of a number of widely recognized and influential current and/or former US policy-makers to Ukraine in November aiming to conduct meetings with and bring positive signal/message and support on Nikolay's issue to the Ukrainian top officials above with the ultimate purpose to close down for any cases/pursuits against Nikolay in Ukraine.

,"The California Secretary of State quickly [distributed a memo](https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ccrov/pdf/2020/october/20240jl.pdf) explaining why this is illegal, but according to one of the original sources linked in your article, the California Republicans say their boxes are legal:

> In a news release, the California Republican Party said state law does not specifically ban them from collecting ballots in a box. They say the law only prevents tampering or forging ballots and that people collecting the ballots cannot be paid for doing it.

> ...

> In California, state law says voters who can’t return their ballots themselves can ask anyone else to do it for them. Previously, people who returned a ballot for someone else also had to sign it and list their relationship to the voter. But a separate law passed in 2018 eliminated that requirement. 

To clarify that, the relevant statute is [Election Code § 3011](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-3011.html), which states that the outer envelope of mail ballots must contain:

> (9) The name of the person authorized by the voter to return the vote by mail ballot pursuant to [Section 3017](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-3017.html).

> (10) The relationship to the voter of the person authorized to return the vote by mail ballot.

> (11) The signature of the person authorized to return the vote by mail ballot.

and the relevant bit of [§ 3017](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-3017.html):

> A vote by mail voter who is unable to return the ballot may designate another person to return the ballot to the elections official who issued the ballot, to the precinct board at a polling place or vote center within the state, or to a vote by mail ballot dropoff location within the state that is provided pursuant to Section 3025 or 4005 .  The person designated shall return the ballot in person, or put the ballot in the mail, no later than three days after receiving it from the voter or before the close of the polls on election day, whichever time period is shorter. 

There is no indication that the fake dropoff boxes provided voters with the name of the person whom they are designating to carry their ballots to a real dropoff, so this was clearly not intended to be lawful. But the 2018 addition to § 3011:

> (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (9) to (11), inclusive, of subdivision (a), a ballot shall not be disqualified solely because the person authorized to return it did not provide on the identification envelope his or her name, relationship to the voter, or signature.

This paragraph protects the *victims* of this scam, the people who were tricked into putting their ballots in the fake dropboxes, and they won't necessarily suffer the consequence of not having their votes counted. (An appropriate remedy might be for the state to subpoena any list of fraudulently collected ballots that the Republicans might have kept, then contact every one of those voters asking them to confirm in writing that they meant to authorize so-and-so to carry their ballots for them, or simply notify them with all possible urgency that their ballots may have been tampered with and reissue them, but if it is impossible to identify the victims then their ballots can still be counted.) But there is no protection here for anyone who intentionally deceives voters into submitting improper ballots by effectively impersonating the government.

Specifically, the main law they have willfully broken is [§ 18403](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-18403.html)

> Any person other than an elections official or a member of the precinct board who receives a voted ballot from a voter or who examines or solicits the voter to show his or her voted ballot is punishable by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code for 16 months or two or three years, or in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment.  This section shall not apply to persons returning a vote by mail ballot pursuant to Sections 3017 and 3021 or persons assisting a voter pursuant to Section 14282.

The exceptions clearly do not apply because the victims did not even have the ability to designate a specific person as their third-party ballot carrier, or even likely the knowledge that they were supposed to be doing so, because the name of the person unloading the fake dropbox was not printed on the label, which at least in some cases seen by CNN falsely claimed the box was ""Official"". So the likely penalties for the election fraud alone may include a five-figure fine and a multi-year prison sentence. As for impersonating the government, the Secretary of State also cites [§ 18575](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-18575.html):

> Every person is guilty of a felony, and on conviction shall be punished by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code for two, three or four years, who at any election:

> (a) Without first having been appointed and qualified, acts as an election officer.

> (b) Not being an election officer, performs or discharges any of the duties of an election officer in regard to the handling, counting, or canvassing of any ballots.

So add a few more years to a potential prison sentence. Clearly no lawyers blessed the execution of this scam.",Epistaxis,,jb6qbv,g8wg8uh
,"California election law ([section 3025](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/elections-code/elec-sect-3025.html)) provides this definition:

So, unless the box was established by the election officials, it is not a permitted ballot drop box.

If you read the full sentence that quote was cherry-picked from it's clear that Congress itself is not the body being referred to. Congress has the power to create another body that would then judge the president's fitness for office:

> Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as **Congress may by law provide**, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.",ItsKonway,,j8efrw,g8c3rgs

So this basically allows Congress to put together a committee-type group of their choosing that can transmit a declaration, equivalent to the cabinet doing so - Either one requiring majority. So no conflict with 25A here.

The committee has no teeth unless the VP also transmits a declaration of POTUS being unable to serve. If POTUS files what is basically an appeal, then a 2/3 supermajority of each congressional house would be needed to transfer power to VP.

Reinforcing these powers is Congress’s broad authority “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof”.

The authority to oversee derives from these constitutional powers. Congress could not carry them out reasonably or responsibly without knowing what the executive is doing; how programs are being administered, by whom, and at what cost; and whether officials are obeying the law and complying with legislative intent. The Supreme Court has legitimated Congress’s investigative power, subject to constitutional safeguards for civil liberties.

>**criminal charges against a president would “violate the constitutional separation of powers”** delineating the authority of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the U.S. government.

That and a prior Watergate-era DOJ memo is why no sitting president has yet been indicted on any charges, impeachment aside.

* A president may, at anytime, transfer their powers to the VP [per the 25th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv). If done, this would possibly prevent the legal challenge that I initially mentioned.

* Prosecutors of a president *could* be accused of violating items within ""18 U.S. Code CHAPTER 115—TREASON, SEDITION, AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES"" if forcing a president to go to jail can be considered overthrowing (part of) the government by forcing the president to go to jail, presumably greatly hindering their duties.

There is no Constitutional requirement to have or honor the results of a popular presidential election.

,"I will do my best to address the 2nd definition concerning systemic issues rather than the 1st definition which could be classified as individual racial prejudice. 

While much has been said about Biden's leading role in the [1994 Crime Bill](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/07/biden-on-the-1994-crime-bill/), I would argue the bill itself should not be seen as a singular all-encompassing piece of legislation but could be viewed as the most notable bill passed among [many](https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/senate-bill/1762) [other](https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/2878) [bills](https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/5210) in the late 80s and early 90s that contributed to [decades long trends](https://www.nap.edu/read/18613/chapter/6) of rapidly increasing incarceration rates. It's more likely that the 1994 bill [exasperated and accelerated](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/04/11/bill-clinton-black-lives-and-the-myths-of-the-1994-crime-bill) incarceration trends that were on the rise for decades.

In addition to the crime bill, Biden has a complicated history when it comes to issues like desegregation. During his 1972 [Senate campaign](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/joe-biden-record-on-busing-incarceration-racial-justice-democratic-primary-2020-explained.html) run, Biden appeared to support such issues like busing, going so far as to accuse ""Republicans of demagoguing the busing issue, and appealing to white voters’ ugliest instincts"". However, [busing was widely unpopular among whites](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/effective-but-never-popular-court-ordered-busing-is-a-relic-few-would-revive/2019/07/07/dce439c8-9d40-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html) in the 70's and Biden eventually bent towards the will of public opinion. This issue reappeared in the 2019 primary debates, when both Sen. Booker and Sen. Harris [attacked](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/28/18965923/joe-biden-school-desegregation-busing-democratic-primary) Biden supported a bill that would limit the Federal government's ability to enforce court ordered busing mandates. 


That said, Biden's 2020 platform has [an agenda for the black community](https://joebiden.com/highlights-from-joe-bidens-agenda-for-the-black-community/#) that specifically includes :

* Creating wealth in the black community by devoting $30 billion to a small business opportunity fund

* investment in communities through housing, including a $15k refundable tax credit for first time buyers, plans to build 1.5 million homes, and the elimination of discriminatory housing regulations

* investing in students and educators

* support beyond high school including tuition-free for families making less than $125k, something the campaign estimates would apply to 90% of black, latino and indigenous households

* clean energy and environmental justice, an issue crafted in the [Biden Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations](https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf)

* strengthening the right to vote

* improvement to the Violence Against Women Act

While not specifically targeting systemic racism, criminal justice reform has also been proposed by the [Biden campaign](https://www.vox.com/2020/8/19/21372408/joe-biden-racial-justice-policy), one that includes 

* abolishing the death penalty

* decriminalization of marijuana

* eliminating mandatory minimums for non violent crimes

* ending cash bail system 

* $20 million in grants to accelerate criminal justice reform 



There also is a section that specifically [targets improvements for black men](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-joe-and-kamala-will-empower-black-men/) and calls for the [Federal Reserve to add targeting persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, and wealth to its core mandate](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/28/896132054/biden-details-proposal-to-advance-racial-equity-in-america). 

Biden has also proposed [immigration reform](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/04/joe-biden-latino-voters-unveils-plan-tackles-inequalities) to include protections for DACA recipients. 

Whether or not these proposals are adopted in a potential Biden presidency has to be seen but Biden is still polling quite high [among minority voters](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/18/biden-black-latino-voters-417473) though Biden's support among black, latino an asian voters (67%) trails behind what Clinton achieved in 2016 (71%).",canekicker,,j7y9sw,g87w0g8
,"Joe Biden has repeatedly bragged over the years about ""Plan Colombia"", claiming the mantle of ""architect"".

Plan Colombia was, and continues to be, devastating to non-white populations in South America.  The plan Biden architected has destroyed non-white people's public drinking water supplies with pollution, destroyed their farm land with pollution, contributed to deforestation, and increased the risk of species extinction.

I'd also like to note that Biden, ironically, claims to be a champion of the environment while actively destroying it.  Just as he claims to be a champion of American black people while active destroying their communities with policies like the 1994 crime bill.

Biden's Plan Colombia also funded death squads.

To this day, non-white populations still suffer high cancer and parkinson's disease rates, displacement from their land, and massacres, due to Biden's policy - which he is extremely proud of.

>The final version of Plan Colombia was seen as considerably different, since its main focuses would deal with drug trafficking and strengthening the military.[13] When this final version was debated on the U.S. Senate floor, Joseph Biden spoke as a leading advocate of the more hardline strategy.[14]

...

>A United Nations study reported that elements within the Colombian security forces, which have been strengthened due to Plan Colombia and U.S. aid, do continue to maintain intimate relationships with right-wing death squads, help organize paramilitary forces, and either participate in abuses and massacres directly or, as it is usually argued to be more often the case, deliberately fail to take action to prevent them. One of the larger examples of this behavior was the 2008 False Positives Scandal, in which the Colombian military murdered approximately 1,400 innocent civilians in order to make false claims that these cadavers were Farc soldiers.[37]

,"The [1936 Literary Digest Poll](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~deturck/m170/wk4/lecture/case1.html) famously forecast a 57-43 (so 14 point) lead for Landon over Roosevelt.  Roosevelt ended up winning by 25 points, so it was a 39 point miss on the whole.  But the Literary Digest poll wasn't conducted to modern standards.

Asking just about presidential elections is too limiting though, because we only have a handful of presidential races to look at.  I think you want to look at races more generally.

[On average](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-are-all-right/), major U.S. political polls miss by 5-6 points (see also [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2019/)).   Taking the 538 database of 9,599 polls conducted in the final three weeks of major US general and primary elections, 1,363 of them (14.2%) missed by 10 points or more.  So there's nothing terribly unusual about a 10 point polling miss in a major election.

Of course that's looking at *individual* polls, and the figures you're looking at involve polling *averages*.  The averages should outperform the individual polls.  So I ran simple average for each race in the 538 database.  The polling average missed by 10 points or more in 247 of 1,790 races.  But many of those races had just a single or a few polls.  538 also includes primary elections which are harder to forecast.

If we limit to general election races with 10 or more polls in the final three weeks, we get 224 races.  Only 2 of these (0.9%) involved a miss of 10 points or more: the 2014 Kansas Senate race (narrow lead in the polls for Greg Orman but actually a landslide victory for Pat Roberts)  and the 2000 Pennsylvania Senate race (polling showed a 17 point lead for Rick Santorum who won but only by about 7 points).",chadtr5,,j7ijdc,g85ewyh

,"Trying to divorce my own political views from my opinion here:

I think this was a tale of two halves, and the first half of the debate was won by Kamala. This was the portion where Pence was posed questions he could not possibly hope to answer in a satisfactory way (i.e. the presidential medical records, the Rose Garden event, etc.), and so he tried to completely move away from them. I think Harris could have done a much better job on calling him out on not answering, but overall I give her the edge.

The second half of the debate was Pence's, though. He did run over time a decent bit which I think risked having people draw lines back to Trump's performance, but overall he came across as generally respectful (at least when compared to Trump, which is not a high bar to clear). Most importantly, he did what Harris did not: he nailed her on not answering the court packing question, which was made all the worse by her telling him to not interrupt so that she could answer it. Plus, Harris repeated some one-liners like ""I will not be lectured to"" which made her come across as a bit fake in those moments.

Looking at the debate on the whole, neither of them really gave substantive answers... I guess Harris gave a little more on her ticket's platform, but the majority of the debate was attacking each other. And, speaking of attacking each other, I think Pence did a decent job of calling Harris out on her historically progressive voting record vs. the more moderate image Biden is trying to convey. 

Overall, I think Pence won the debate by a bit, and Harris missed an opportunity to tie Pence more closely to Trump's massive blunders like the maskless Rose Garden event. That being said, I think Pence/Trump needed a homerun to mitigate the catastrophic week Trump has had with his debate performance, the covid diagnosis, and his stimulus tweet, and I did not see that here.

Each candidate was given softball questions. Each refused to swing on multiple occasions.

I don't like that Pence dodged the question on abortion. [He's spent years talking about overturning Roe v. Wade.](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/tracking-trump/player/mike-pence) And yet with ACB getting a vote for SCOTUS, he's suddenly unwilling to make the basic statement of ""yes, I believe abortions should be outlawed at the federal level.""

Pence spent a majority of his time on foreign policy repeating the same lies as Trump about [""defeating ISIS""](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/trumps-isis-claim-goes-to-the-dogs/).

,"So looking at the articles you posted I think you are drawing larger conclusions than they make.

1.
The first (Gerrymandering Incumbency: Does Nonpartisan Redistricting Increase Electoral Competition?) makes the claim that independent redistricting commissions do not create more competitive elections, as incumbent advantage stays about the same statistically. This is different than the claim that independent commissions do not create less gerrymandered districts. They also claim that courts tend to draw the ""best"" maps with regard to competitive elections. None of this detracts from gerrymandering causing unfair representation.

Additionally, this paper takes a national POV to reach it's conclusions - whereas the larger problems of gerrymandering are seen in state legislatures. 

2.
The second (Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization? ) is from 2007. It is about national politics again and compares the 90s to early 2000s. It suggests that polarization is not caused by gerrymandering. Because it is before the strategic republican push of 2010 redistricting I think it has less merit in today's world. However, it does end with this: ""Nothing we say should be interpreted as contentment with congressional districting as it is currently practiced"" which implies that even the author has a problem with then gerrymandering practices

3.
The third (The Gerrymanderers Are Coming! Legislative Redistricting Won’t Affect Competition or Polarization Much,No Matter Who Does It) looks at legislative polarization rather than electoral polarization. One of the interesting lines is:
> The trend is consistent
across both measures of legislative polarization.
Judging by these state legislatures, partisan redistricting schemes are, if anything, associated with
declining legislative polarization. It is possible
that this is evidence of redistricting officials who
are trying to increase the seats held by the majority party, which creates more moderate districts
in the process. These are possibly just spurious
relationships. There is no support for the idea,
however, that partisan gerrymandering causes
an increase in legislative polarization.
 


4.
The fourth (Evaluating partisan gains from Congressional gerrymandering: Using
computer simulations to estimate the effect of gerrymandering in the U.S. House) is again a national pre 2010 simulation. However, this paper does reference several papers that show ""substantial partisan bias"", all of the dates are pre 2010 for all the studies: 
>Some studies have shown that partisan redistricting produces substantial partisan biases in the outcomes of
legislative elections (Abramowitz, 1983; Erikson, 1972; King, 1989;
Cox and Katz, 1999; McDonald, 2004). While other studies have
found that partisan redistricting produces minor, mixed or null
partisan effects (Ferejohn, 1977; Glazer et al., 1987; Squire, 1985;
Gelman and King, 1994; Abramowitz et al., 2006).

 

WITH all that being said none of these seem to defend gerrymandering, but instead suggest that it is a hard problem with a non-trivial solution. 

BUT I you mentioned lack of information due to paywalls so I found some non-paywalled sources.
 
A. This is someone's thesis that includes a bit of literature review, good place to start and get acquainted with an area that you may not have studied (I have't studied congressional districting and the jargon that is used).

B. This is from Fair Vote and a self-proclaimed non-partisan org that champions voting reform and includes a list of free literature about redistricting reform. I haven't read it all but assume it all supports redistricting.

,"I know this is only addressing part of the question, but I do see a flaw with this from the second to last reference:

>The analysis reveals that while Republican and Democratic gerrymandering affects the partisan outcomes of Congressional elections in some states, the net effect across the states is modest

If Congress was a group of 535 federally elected officials this would make sense, but if the idea is that congressmen represent their state's interest in alingment with the wishes of their states population, then you still have a problem of misproportioned representation.

A specific example is the recent court ordered redistricting of pennsylvania.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania%27s_congressional_districts

After the new map was drawn, the portion of Republicans to democratic house members went from 12/6 to 9/9. Whether you agree with the decision or not, I think it's hard to say that such a large shift doesn't affect how the state of pennsylvania is represented in congress.",Only_As_I_Fall,,j3gioe,g7d00t8
,">From the studies that I could find, and the ones that weren’t locked behind the walls, the evidence is either nonexistent or very moderate in terms of any affect gerrymandering has, not only on political representation, but in fair voting districts itself.

Please reference Wisconsin and other states like Michigan.

The GOP won less than 50% of the votes, but holds \~60-somthing percent of seats.

This has a direct and real impact on legislation.

Similar story in Michigan. The GOP has lost just about all state wide elections for the past several cycles (federal senate seats, governor, etc.), but they still control the legislative bodies.

>In 2014 and 2016, Republicans and Democrats received close to equal numbers of statewide votes in state House races. Yet Republicans hold a 63-47 seat majority. The discrepancy was even worse for state Senate races in 2014, when Republicans took home just slightly more votes but came away with an overwhelming 27-11 majority.

,"Yes it indirectly causes polarization, but that is unimportant considering the larger issue that gerrymandering, and more largely the electoral college, are fundamentally undemocratic. I understand the function of the non-proportional system we have, that we are fundamentally a federation of states, many of whom joined with an understanding that they would not live under the tyranny of the big states. But I think people within a state should have a right to equal representation, at the very least.

Even disregarding inter-party competition, gerrymandering makes elections less competitive in general. These “safe” counties drives the system to effectively select for more corrupt officials, as their popularity amongst swing voters is even less important, the importance of social/financial connections and catering to special interests becomes outsized. This corruption leads to a loss of faith in public institutions which does lead more people to radicalize, and then the eventual normalization of radical thought in public discourse cements polarization. However I would say that the “first-past-the-post” aspect of the electoral college has a greater effect on polarization than gerrymandering, due to the structural barrier it creates to third parties gaining influence.

To your argument that there is not enough theory and research to prove that gerrymandering can be used for partisan purposes to create a tyranny of the minority, there are many instances in American politics which already exemplify this. I would refer you to the last election I voted in Madison WI
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Wisconsin_State_Assembly_election
“Democrats would have needed to win the statewide popular vote by a margin of 20.36% to win a majority of seats.”

You cannot tell me that one side has to outvote the other side by 20% to have a say in anything, and that political system is fair. Regardless of proving partisan intent, it’s demonstrably unfair. Given that elections often regress to around 50/50 splits within the popular vote, you don’t have to press hard on the scales to completely tip the whole thing to fall over on one side.

To get to definition, gerrymandering is unfair, specifically to the individuals whose votes are effectively “wasted” due to it. This can be measured and is represented as the “voting efficiency gap”, the most broadly accepted measure within academia, as described in:

*Stephanopoulos, Nicholas; McGhee, Eric (2014). “Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap”. University of Chicago Law Review. 82: 831–900. SSRN 2457468. Wasted votes and efficiency gap are defined pp. 850–852.*

The formula just calculates the difference in wasted votes between the two parties.",otterpigeon,,j3gioe,g7d1q04
,"I think this is more complicated than the princeton university authors implied. The gerrymandering process creates districts for both parties which are uncompetitive for one or the other party. I think the diagram in the wikipedia article depicts it well.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering

Also, looking at the article, I'm not sure plain regression will deal with these problems well. Regression assumed that the ""explained"" and the ""explainer"" variables are independent. If they are not - the analysis suffers from multicollinearity, which can fundamentally impact the results.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity

Is gerrymandering really independent of constituents preferences? Or maybe - could gerrymandering effect preferences? If constituents don't have to mark hard compromises in their representative selection, do they self radicalize? If any of this is true, taking a spot in time estimate of the constituents ""preferences"" and using statistics to show they are in line with the gerrymandered elections will lead to misleading results without very careful handholding of the methods.",xstegzx,,j3gioe,g7cv4zl
,"This is a fascinating question. While [polarization was initially driven by Republicans, most notable around the late 1990s](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/), how much of that polarization could have represented the views of the American public?

,"Climate change is a tricky issue in the U.S., politically speaking, due to right-wing opposition to pretty much every proposal, to the point of denying that climate change even is real (or a [""Hoax invented by the Chinese""](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/), as the current President put it). 

The above enforcement mechanism reference, is probably left vague on purpose, since, typically speaking, it's one of the more unpopular elements of dealing with climate change. We'll have to wait and see what they mean.

The difference between Biden's plan on climate change and the Green New Deal, as written by Sanders, is that in Biden's plan, about $2 trillion will be spent over 10 years, and in Sanders plan, $15 trillion will be spent over 10 years on this issue. With the Green New Deal's price tag, it would become the largest government program in the U.S. (currently, the largest government program in the U.S. is Social Security at the price of $1.1 trillion a year). Biden's plan is more modest than that, but it is more likely to pass, and more likely to not face the backlash the Green New Deal would have faced. The structure of the Green New Deal is generally okay, with 20% supporting and 20% opposing. [2020 Hill Poll](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/americans-like-the-green-new-deals-goals-but-question-its-cost-that-is-if-theyve-even-heard-of-it-2019-11-27) Once people learn about the price tag, about 60% of Americans oppose it, so it would be very difficult to actually pass it with not only oil companies and Republicans against you, but most Americans. So the price tag is more modest.

And progressives who were initially critical of Biden's plan, such as the Sunrise Movement, approve of the plan as it is and have since come around on this issue.

,"There's a variety of factors that contribute to the focus of these four states' ""swinginess."" 

For one, there's just the numbers math of electoral college votes. Florida has 29, Pennsylvania has 20, Michigan has 16, Wisconsin has 10. Obviously, there are states with more - e.g. California (55), Texas (38) - but these 4 are the states that are considered to be winnable by either party and less entrenched politically. There are states that are so reliably Democrat (California, NY, NJ, Massachusetts,) or Republican (Texas, Alabama, Missouri) that the opposing party usually don't bother to run highly funded campaigns. So in some ways, it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. You want to go after states that will give you best bang for your buck - sure, you can try to win Maine, and it's a swing state in that it votes back and forth, but at the same time, it only has 4 electoral votes. Or you can pour a lot of money into Alabama, but remember, this was the state that needed a Republican candidate with serious sexual misconduct charges against 14 and 16 year olds for a Democratic candidate to be viable (I am mourning Doug Jones in advance.) You may as well be dumping money in the trash. 

Secondly, there's the fairly [well reported general growing polarization of politics in the US](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/09/10/voters-attitudes-about-race-and-gender-are-even-more-divided-than-in-2016/) with a lot of it falling in gender and racial issues. The Democrat and Republican consensus on these issues have grown further apart, and part of that has also been based in how urban a state is. [FiveThirtyEight has an excellent piece on this](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/) where generally very urban states go Democrat, and generally very rural states go Republican. The swing states you mention - FL, PA, MI, WI are generally in the middle of the urbanization index. They've got populations that are more proportionally rural and urban, which means that it's winnable for either party depending on who turns out. 

Urbanization of a state also correlates with several other trends that can predict relative Republican or Democrat lean. Race, education, and religion are the big three in that. Cities are more racially diverse, and [black, asian, and hispanic voters lean Democrat by a margin of 69, 42, and 30 points respectively.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/) Cities tend to have a higher proportion of university (+) educated people, since there are better paying jobs. Democrats lead by 22 points in adults with post-grad degrees. Rural areas tend to be more religious in a Catholic/Christian/Mormon sense. Republicans lead by 48 points with Mormons and 46 with white evangelical Protestants. 

In short - why are these the swing states and what makes them swingy? They have the number of votes to make it worth fighting for, they are less politically entrenched/more proportionally politically entrenched because there's a better balance of cities and rural areas. And that in turn is correlated with race, religion, and education, which are some of the biggest indicators for party affiliation. 

I've tried to use as neutral as possible sources - I highly respect Pew and 538. (Also love Gallup, but I happened to be on Pew.) 538 obviously leans liberal, but I find their stuff to be based in numbers and more horseracey rather than political commentary. This is by no means comprehensive dive, but I hope you get a better basic understanding from this!


Edit: Maine is not a good example to use because I totally forgot they split their electoral votes. Ugh! New Hampshire would be a way better example, also with 4 electoral votes. They went Reagan --> HW --> Clinton --> W (x1) --> Kerry --> Obama (x2) --> Clinton.",starsinblack,,j1446h,g6x712n
,"One main cause of the importance of such swing states in the presidential election is the ubiquity of [Winner-takes-all](https://ballotpedia.org/Winner-take-all) elector selections for most states.

,"From a practical standpoint, can state legislatures even select a slate of electors?

Legally, they can, but this isn’t a question of legality.

The majority of state legislatures are part time and are [adjourned for the year](https://ballotpedia.org/Dates_of_2020_state_legislative_sessions), they are not scheduled to be back before the December 8, 2020, “safe harbor” deadline. 

Each state has different rules about who can call a special session, when, and for what reasons. Typically the governor can, but there are sometimes limits on why, and no governor is going to call a special session when the legislature has a majority of the other party.

Currently 36 states have one party control, [15 Democrat and 21 Republican](https://ballotpedia.org/State_government_trifectas).

Looking at a selection of swing states:

[Pennsylvania](https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Pennsylvania_legislative_session) has a full time legislature, but a divided government. Republicans have both houses of the legislature and the state has a Democratic governor.

[Ohio](https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Ohio_legislative_session) has a full time legislature and total Republican control of state government.

[Wisconsin](https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Wisconsin_legislative_session) has a full time legislature, a Democratic governor, and Republicans control both the state House and state Senate.

I am not going to go through all the swing states, but the idea is that there are practical considerations to if relying on state legislatures to pick slates of electors is even a viable strategy.

It may be more of a scare tactic, I (or someone) would need to go through every state (plus the rules of special sessions in each state where there is unified control) to know for sure.


**EDIT:** Correction pointed out by u/toasters_are_great/


**Update:** In addition to the rules for a special session, knowing if this is even practical requires checking the laws in the relevant states to see if there are any provisions in state law requiring electors to be chosen by popular vote.

The U.S. Constitution allows state legislatures to determine the manner of picking electors, and they may pick electors by concurrent resolution ([Florida started this process in 2000](https://archive.is/M52RC)).

But a state may have legislated how they select electors, which (depending on the state) could mean the legislature does not have the option of a concurrent resolution.

A state legislature controlled by one party may be able to select a slate of electors, but would face complications if a state law said that electors shall be chosen through an election and if that laws does not include any provision for what happens if the election is not be resolved by a certain date.

This would be less of a problem if the governor is of the same party as the legislature, they could just pass a new law. But if the governor is of a different party s/he would have no reason to sign that bill into law.

It gets even more complicated if there are relevant state constitution provisions. 

A current state legislature could argue that the U.S. Constitution gives it the exclusive power to determine the method of selecting electors, and the past state legislatures choice to require a popular vote can’t bind the current state legislature. I don’t know how successful that argument would be, but I’m sure some people can make a persuasive case using it.

,"I've been thinking a lot about this topic, even before The Atlantic article came out, and I decided to do some research to figure out what is possible.  [538 thinks that there are 14 states](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/) that have a greater than 1% chance of being a tipping point state.  These 14 are:

* Pennsylvania (32.6%): State Legislature is Republican in both houses, it is in regular session until Nov 30th, but the Governor is a Democrat.  The Republican majority is not large enough to be veto-proof, so any bill that is passed to change the selection of electors would likely be vetoed.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently ruled that mail-in ballots [can arrive as late as Nov. 6](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-north-carolina-likely-wont-be-called-on-election-night/) and still count.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Pennsylvania_legislative_session
* Florida (12%): Florida has a Republican trifecta, but it is not currently in session, so they would not be able to pass any bills.  Under Florida law, the Gov DeSantis can call a special session, just recently [threatening to do so in response to BLM protests](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/florida-gov-ron-desantis-proposes-special-session-on-protest-bill-11697291), so he could call one post-election if desired.   See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Florida_legislative_session
* Wisconsin (9.7%): Similar to Pennsylvania, both houses are Republican controlled, but lacking a veto-proof majority, with a Democratic Governor.  They are currently sitting in a Special Session, and could pass bills if desired, but they would probably be vetoed.  A federal judge ordered Wisconsin to count absentee ballots that are [postmarked by Nov. 3 as long as they arrive by Nov. 9.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-north-carolina-likely-wont-be-called-on-election-night/)  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Wisconsin_legislative_session
* Michigan (8%): Similar to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, both houses are Republican controlled, but lacking a veto-proof majority, with a Democratic Governor.  They are currently sitting in a regular legislative session until Dec 31.  A state judge in Michigan decreed that ballots can be counted as long as they are [postmarked by the day before the election](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-north-carolina-likely-wont-be-called-on-election-night/) (Nov. 2) and received by Nov. 17.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Michigan_legislative_session
* Arizona (6.1%): Arizona has a Republican trifecta but is not in session, similar to Florida.  Like them, the Governor could call a special session if desired.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Arizona_legislative_session
* Ohio (5%): Ohio has a Republican trifecta, and is sitting in normal session until Dec 31.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Ohio_legislative_session
* North Carolina (4.8%): North Carolina is another divided state with a Republican majority and a Democratic Governor.  There legislative session ended on Sept 3, and it's not likely that the Governor would call a special one.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_North_Carolina_legislative_session
* Nevada (3%): Nevada has a Democratic trifecta, and is not sitting in session currently, but could be called to special session by the Governor.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Nevada_legislative_session
* Minnesota (2.8%): Minnesota is a completely divided state with one party controlling one house, another in the 2nd house, and a Democratic governor.  They are not currently sitting in session.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Minnesota_legislative_session
* Colorado (2.7%): Colorado has a Democratic trifecta, and is not in session.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Colorado_legislative_session
* New Hampshire (2.1%): New Hampshire is divided, with a non-veto-proof Democratic majority in both houses, and a Republican governor.  They are not currently in session.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_New_Hampshire_legislative_session
* Georgia (1.9%): Georgia has a Republican trifecta, and is not currently in session.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Georgia_legislative_session
* Texas (1.6%): Texas has a Republican trifecta, and is not in session.  [Texas does not allow voting by mail](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/) without a valid excuse (the pandemic is not one).  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Texas_legislative_session
* Virginia (1.5%): Virginia has a Democratic trifecta, and is currently sitting in special session.  See: https://ballotpedia.org/2020_Virginia_legislative_session

Of these 14 states, 6 of them are divided (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Minnesota, New Hampshire) and it seems likely that the Governor would not call a special session, and would veto any legislation to change the selection of electors.  Fighting over the election results might happen in the courts, but it wouldn't happen in the legislature.  For the remaining 8 states, 5 of them are controlled completely by the Republicans (Florida, Arizona, Ohio, Georgia, Texas) and 3 of them are controlled by the Democrats (Nevada, Colorado, Virginia) and it's possible that they could vote to shorten election counting, or to choose a set of electors not inline with the nominal election results, or otherwise tamper with the results in a partisan manner.

As mentioned above, 4 of these states have already had court challenges around the legality of mail-in ballots, and it seems likely that these will get appealed and continue to be litigated.  So far the rulings in these challenges have all extended the deadline for mail-in ballots, for additional days of counting.",petrov76,,iz7lg0,g6kndvm

,"As part of an extremely [long wargame scenario](https://www.jamesjheaney.com/2020/08/23/and-the-war-came/) I wrote earlier this year, I explored this possibility in some detail. 

The context in my particular scenario is that a dispute about Russian interference in provisional ballot counting has rendered election results in Pennsylvania *genuinely ambiguous*, and a month of court battles and partisan maneuvering has failed to resolve the conflict. If you'll pardon the slightly out-of-context extended quotation:

>On Monday, **December 8th**, as the noon deadline came and went, Gov. Wolf and Sec. Boockvar received only two new sets of vote tabulation certificates from “non-participating” Republican counties. ...She then tabulated the votes and presented the results to Gov. Wolf. According to Pennsylvania’s second recount, with all provisional ballots counted, but several counties boycotting, Joe Biden was winner of the state’s presidential election, by a margin of 6,411 votes.

>Wolf then asked Boockvar for an alternative tabulation: what if, instead of simply not counting the votes of the boycotting counties, the state counted their previously-certified vote totals from the previous recount?

>Boockvar already had that alternative tabulation prepared, and informed Gov. Wolf that, even if the boycotting counties’ votes were counted, Biden still won by a margin of 213 votes. Counting all provisional ballots had put him over the top, regardless of what the Republican boycott counties did.

>Gov. Wolf formally accepted Sec. Boockvar’s certified results and, as required under [25 P.S. § 3166](https://govt.westlaw.com/pac/Document/NE90FC3D0343011DA8A989F4EECDB8638?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)), he signed an order issuing Certificates of Election to the victorious presidential electors: the Democratic slate of electors pledged to Joe Biden. The “final determination” of his office, under Pennsylvania law, was that Joe Biden had won Pennsylvania and all its electoral votes—and he had made this determination prior to the expiration of the federal safe harbor provision.

***

>On Tuesday, **December 9th**, the Republican-led legislature passed a joint resolution asserting that Gov. Wolf was a “liar” and a “cheat,” in those words. The determination of the legislature was that Donald Trump had won Pennsylvania and that Biden and Wolf were stealing the election.

>Then they got down to business. And that business involved a little history.

>Article II of the Constitution states, “Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors.” Each state legislature has plenary authority to appoint electors. The total authority of legislatures over a state’s electors had been affirmed many times, most prominently in McPherson v. Blacker, an 1892 Supreme Court decision that affirmed Michigan’s right to apportion electoral votes by congressional district (which the Democrats wanted to do in order to boost Grover Cleveland’s re-election chances, true story, [kinda worked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1892_United_States_presidential_election_in_Michigan), too). The principle was also affirmed more recently in Chiafalo v. Washington, a 2020 decision that allowed state legislatures to pass laws against so-called “faithless electors.”

>The state legislature can hold a popular election to appoint electors, effectively transferring the legislature’s Constitutional authority over electors to the voters. Indeed, [since 1876](https://www.fairvote.org/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all), that’s exactly what every state has done. But there is no actual constitutional requirement to hold popular presidential elections! Indeed, as we discussed at the beginning, the Founding Fathers specifically intended to avoid the calamity of popular presidential elections, which is why they gave us the electoral college in the first place. Thus, any state legislature can pass laws abolishing the popular presidential election, then choose the state’s presidential electors directly. The legislature could also appoint a commission to choose the electors, automatically appoint party officials as electors ex officio, choose the electors by picking random names out of a phone book, whatever. The legislature’s authority is total.

>In one of history’s strange little footnotes, direct legislative appointment of electors [*actually happened*](https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/UF/00/02/78/36/00054/00054.pdf) in Florida during the disputed 2000 election. Although practically no one remembers it now, there was a very confusing week early in December 2000 when nobody knew whether Florida was going to be able to resolve its massive voting dispute in time for the electoral college vote (which, that year, was on December 18th). The state legislature, with both houses under Republican control, called itself into special session. (The governor, Jeb Bush, was also a Republican—not to mention the brother of the Republican candidate, George W. Bush.)

>On December 12th, 2000, the Florida Legislature passed a concurrent resolution, HCR 1-A, which asserted that “the election for electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America held on November 7, 2000, ultimately failed to make a choice of such electors,” and, therefore, “that the Florida Legislature hereby appoints as the 25 electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America… the following named persons…” The resolution then goes on to name each of the twenty-five Republican electors. The debate over the wisdom and legality of this resolution was [long and serious](https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/UF/00/02/78/36/00054/00054.pdf)… but it passed! With this resolution, the Florida legislature nullified the 2000 presidential election in Florida and substituted its own slate of electors, exercising its plenary power under Article II.

>A few hours later, the Supreme Court handed down Bush v. Gore, which declared, in essence, that Bush’s electors had won the original 2000 presidential election in Florida anyway. This made the Florida legislature’s resolution a moot point, so nobody bothered to fight it in court—either way, Bush’s electors had won.

>There were a number of serious legal arguments for why the Florida legislature’s action had been illegal. For example, while a legislature has the innate power to appoint electors, it is not at all clear that the legislature still has the power to appoint electors after it has passed laws transferring that power to a popular vote. Wouldn’t the legislature need to repeal those election laws before trying to appoint its own electors? Wouldn’t the governor get a veto? It is even less clear that the state legislature can nullify an election after it has happened, even if the results are disputed.

>On the other hand, the powers granted to state legislatures in Article II are truly sweeping, and Article II doesn’t say anything about governors getting a say. Governors don’t have a say in ratifying constitutional amendments, and the language in Article V is very similar to the language in Article II. None of these competing arguments were definitively settled during Election 2000, because there was no point in litigating them.

>But, legally speaking, it appears to be the case that the 6 million votes cast in Florida for Bush, Gore, or Nader did not determine Florida’s electors in the 2000 election. Rather, in the 2000 presidential election, the Florida legislature chose its electors directly.

>The Pensylvania legislature decided to follow suit. On December 9th, they passed a resolution declaring “the election for electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America held on November 3, 2020, ultimately failed to make a choice of such electors,” and so they took back control of the process, stated that the Constitution and [3 USC §2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/2)  gave them permission to do this, and finally appointed the entire Republican slate of electors—all pledged to Donald Trump—to cast Pennsylvania’s electoral votes. They ordered Sec. Boockvar to transmit Certificates of Election to the electors. (Fair do’s to Ed Kilgore, a phrase I have never said before and hopefully never will again: [he foresaw this](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/could-legislatures-hijack-the-2020-presidential-election.html).)

***

>On Sunday, **December 13th**, Gov. Wolf [...] formally vetoed the legislature’s appointment of the Trump slate of electors, and he accordingly invalidated the certificates of election for all the Trump electors. This was a neat trick, because the legislature’s appointment of electors was a concurent resolution, not a bill, and the legislature had therefore not presented it to the governor for signing. Thanks to Article II of the U.S. Constitution, the legislature did not believe the governor got any say in appointments of electors. The legislature considered his veto null and void.

>But Gov. Wolf pointed out that the Pennsylvania Constitution, Article III, Section 9, gave him veto authority over all concurrent resolutions, not just ordinary bills. So, did Wolf have authority to veto the legislature and block their electoral slate, or did the U.S. Constitution pre-empt the Pennsylvania Constitution in this case? Nobody could say for sure, and legal experts were divided. It would have to be settled in court… and there was simply no time left.

You're right because the other campaign has already [wargamed out this scenario in July.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/25/nation/bipartisan-group-secretly-gathered-game-out-contested-trump-biden-election-it-wasnt-pretty/)

The House named Mr. Biden president; the Senate and White House stuck with Mr. Trump.

So it's less of a ""plan to do something"" as it is gaming out possible scenarios. Obviously if your opponent has gamed out a scenario it's not really newsworthy to game that out yourself. I think your source is biased and doesn't fit this sub in that it presents it as ""what will happen"" and not ""what people have brought up in various election scenarios that is a completely normal part of a campaign"".",pillage,,iz7lg0,g6hq4ui

,"This deserves a fuller reply, which I will try to remember to provide.

Much scrutiny of Barrett has been directed at how her judging intersects with her Catholic faith. This scrutiny is sexy and makes great headlines, but is [not actually](https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/attack-on-judge-amy-coney-barrett-completely-misfires/) very relevant to [her jurisprudence](https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/on-judge-barrett-and-baseless-claims-about-recusal/).

What's much, much more interesting to me is her work on precedent. A lot of her scholarship has been focused on analyzing *stare decisis* -- why we need it, what authority it has to decide individual cases, and how it interacts with other concerns like due process of law.  See, for the very easy ""five minutes of googling"" examples, [here](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/450/), [here](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/293/), and [here](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/767/). I read some of this work during the last SCOTUS go-round, before Kavanaugh was named, and I remember being very impressed. I'd have to reread to tell you why, though, and I intend to do so if she does get the nod.

Nobody else on SCOTUS, on either side of the bench, has this kind of depth on *stare decisis* -- which is funny, really, since *stare decisis* is one of the most important issues facing the Court today. Her addition to the Court would raise the level of conversation about *stare decisis* up there by an order of magnitude. A lot of this conversation right now consists of Justice Thomas kinda saying that he doesn't think *stare decisis* is real, because it leads justices to follow precedent instead of the law itself, and Justice Breyer countering that *stare decisis* is really important but only pragmatically, and that whether it applies in this case can be easily seen based on [followed by 36 pages of the social science and economics citations that Breyer loves -- but not that much *constitutional law*]. 

I can see Justice Barrett bridging this gap in a big way, showing Justice Thomas that, no, actually, *stare decisis* is important, it just has to be contained within the proper fencelines to avoid doing injustice to litigants, while turning around to Justice Breyer and saying, yeah, that's right, but let's ground that now in the law.

So that possibility excites me.

I don't have more to say right now -- like I said, this deserves a full answer, but I don't have what you need for one right now -- but it is very well worth watching Barrett's little-seen but really enlightening [Case Western Canary Lecture](https://www.jamesjheaney.com/2020/09/19/amy-coney-barretts-constitutional-canards-redux/), in which she discussed her basic high-level legal approach and what she views as common errors in legal analysis. Not the compare-and-contrast approach you were looking for, but very revealing.",BCSWowbagger2,,iwkht2,g69hdan
,"I recently came across an article about Judge Barrett on Judicial Deference that I think a really important consideration regarding Judge Amy's views of the rational-basis test:

# What is the Rational Basis Test?

>In [U.S. constitutional law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution), **rational basis review** is the normal [standard of review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_review) that courts apply when considering constitutional questions, including [due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_of_Law) or [equal protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection) questions under the [Fifth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) or [Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Courts applying rational basis review seek to determine whether a law is ""rationally related"" to a ""legitimate"" government interest, whether real or hypothetical. \[[Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rational_basis) 1\]  
>  
>...in cases dealing with ""regulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions,"" [\[US v.\] Carolene Products](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1808251577400430843&q=carolene+products+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33) stated, ""the existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment is to be presumed."" In other words, judges are supposed to tip the scales in favor of lawmakers when economic liberty might be at stake.  
>  
>\[By contrast,\] If a law or regulation infringes on a right that the Court has deemed fundamental (such as freedom of speech or the right to vote), the Court said in [*United States v. Carolene Products Co.*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1808251577400430843&q=carolene+products+co&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33)*,* the judiciary should presume that law or regulation to be unconstitutional and subject it to ""more exacting judicial scrutiny.""   
>  
>\[This is\] Now known as the rational-basis test... \[[Source](https://reason.com/2020/09/24/amy-coney-barrett-and-the-problem-of-conservative-judicial-deference/) 2\]

# What is Judge Barrett's legal perspective on Rational Basis Test?

>Amy Coney Barrett has written in defense of the rational-basis standard. ""Highly deferential judicial review reflects the judgment that a more searching inquiry would pull judges into terrain they are not good at navigating,"" Barrett wrote in a [2017 article](https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=concomm) for *Constitutional Commentary*. ""The current, deferential regime reflects humility about the capacity of judges to evaluate the soundness of scientific and economic claims."" According to Barrett, ""deferential judicial review of run-of-the-mill legislation"" is defensible on the grounds that such judicial deference ""is consistent with the reality that the harm inflicted by the Supreme Court's erroneous interference in the democratic process is harder to remedy than the harm inflicted by an ill-advised statute."" \[Source 2\]

In other words, her view is that if this test did not exist then the Supreme Court would be more likely to legislate from the bench rather than interpreting the law as written.

# How does Judge Barrett's perspective on Rational Basis Test contrast with 21st Century SCOTUS members?

>The late Antonin Scalia \[who served during the early 21st Century\] once defended judicial deference in similar terms, arguing in a 1984 speech that ""the position the Supreme Court has arrived at is good—or at least that the suggestion that it change its position is even worse."" According to Scalia, the best approach in economic cases was for the courts to adopt an across-the-board stance of judicial pacifism. ""In the long run, and perhaps even in the short run,"" Scalia maintained, ""the reinforcement of mistaken and unconstitutional perceptions of the role of the courts in our system far outweighs whatever evils may have accrued from undue judicial abstention in the economic field."" 

So that view aligns with at least one recent former SCOTUS member.  Presumably this would also align with any SCOTUS members who believe that courts should err on the side of upholding legislation rather than reinterpreting them.  Note that this is different from how constitution focused SCOTUS members may be - More on that below.  I am not familiar with the jurisprudence of others SCOTUS members as it relates to this specific topic, so I'm limited to what I found at a glance in my sources.   Unfortunately I had a hard time finding other 21st century [SCOTUS cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Selected_Supreme_Court_cases) where the rational basis test was obvious in use for issues relating to the 14th amendment.

# What are jurisprudence effects of the Rational Basis Test being applied?

>[*Goesaert v. Cleary*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16860473722424220027&q=Goesaert+v.+Cleary&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33) (1948), in which the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan law forbidding women from working as bartenders unless they were ""the wife or daughter of the male owner."" Valentine Goesaert, who owned a bar in Dearborn, fought for her right to tend bar in her own establishment. She lost thanks to rational-basis deference.  
>  
>""We cannot cross-examine either actually or argumentatively the mind of Michigan legislators nor question their motives,"" declared Justice Felix Frankfurter. ""Since the line they have drawn is not without a basis in reason,"" he wrote, invoking the rational-basis test, ""we cannot give ear to the suggestion that the real impulse behind this legislation was an unchivalrous desire of male bartenders to try to monopolize the calling.""  
>  
>Rational-basis deference was also at the center of the federal district court ruling in [*Niang v. Carroll*](http://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MO-Braiding-Decision.pdf) (2016). At issue was a Missouri law that made it a crime to offer African-style hair braiding services without a cosmetology license. ... In addition to paying thousands of dollars in fees, would-be African-style hair braiders had to complete over 1,500 hours of state-sanctioned education. What is worse, none of Missouri's licensed cosmetology schools actually offered any training in African-style hair braiding. \[It can be argued that\] the regulation at issue served no legitimate public health or safety purpose. \[Source 2\]

These at least serve as easier to understand examples of how the Rational Basis Test can be applied and have economic impact, though neither are SCOTUS cases AND from the 21st century.

# What are constitutional concerns with the Rational Basis Test?

>\[An argument against\] the Scalia-Barrett view is that it runs counter to the text and history of the 14th Amendment, which was written, ratified, and originally understood to protect (among other rights) the right to economic liberty. In the words of Rep. John Bingham (R), the Ohio congressman who served as the principal author of Section One of the 14th Amendment in 1866, ""the provisions of the Constitution guaranteeing rights, privileges, and immunities"" includes ""the constitutional liberty…to work in an honest calling and contribute by your toil in some sort to the support of yourself, to the support of your fellow men, and to be secure in the enjoyment of the fruits of your toil."" \[Source 2\]",Renegade_Meister,,iwkht2,g766sir
,"You may be interested in the group [Fix The Court](https://fixthecourt.com), they have a term limit proposal that would [not require a Constitutional amendment](https://fixthecourt.com/2017/06/tlproposal/). It would only apply to Supreme Court justices confirmed after the law passes, and all justices confirmed after that time would serve 18 years then take senior status.

Other than term limits, removing judges and justices (other than through impeachment and removal) and reducing compensation, anything applying to new judges and justices can be done by Congress.

Congress can increase the total number of judicial districts, judicial circuits, and the total number of judges on each court. Congress can even take the ability to hear cases out of courts jurisdiction through [jurisdiction stripping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction_stripping).

It is easier in a sense to reform lower courts because people pay less attention. Congress has added lower court judgeships and adjusted appeals courts numerous times.

If any reform would achieve the desired outcome depends on who you ask. If the goal is to elect President Biden and add four liberal SCOTUS justices to stack the court 8-5, then yes, adding four justices would do that.

,"One idea I like is to have effectively a set of bench warmers, like in baseball. So, there may be, say, 15 justices on the roster, but only 9 of them sit on an annual basis with the Chief being the only constant. The non-active Associate Justices could then continue practicing as part of appellate panels and such, maintaining real-world expertise and providing consistency in the application of law, generally. There would be fewer appeals to the Supreme Court in this case because the Appellate courts would have more legitimacy and the Supreme would be far less likely to overturn an Appellate decision, allowing the Supreme to deal more with unresolved legal questions. This would also level out the importance placed on individual nominations and theoretically make them less political, and temper wild swings in the court's ideological make-up.

,"I'm going to focus more on item 4 on your list because I personally feel that the other three are rather irrelevant. My personal opinion is that the people with the power to nominate and approve a new justice will do so without regard for precedent or potential electoral consequences.

The last real effort to substantially change the Supreme Court's numbers was led by FDR. The [reform bill of 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Procedures_Reform_Bill_of_1937) would have allowed the president to add justices equal to the number that were already over the age of 70. This was in response to the Supreme Court declaring parts of the New Deal unconstitutional. 

What's interesting about this one is that it didn't die because the other party held too much power. It died, in fact, due to internal opposition. Senate Democrats killed the bill. I don't think that happens this time.

What I'm curious about is whether the court would be able to use Judicial Review to review a law about itself. An 1868 bill (though I can't find the exact terminology of it) aimed to require a 2/3 majority of justices to declare a law unconstitutional. This was killed in the senate because they weren't sure if the court could declare that law unconstitutional as it would essentially be the court ruling on what the court could do and thus violating separation of powers. So far, it seems this hasn't been tested much. 

So, could a Republican supreme court simply wave away any attempts to pack the court? Possibly.",steelerfaninperu,,ivu7dm,g5ttncm

Romney hasn't been afraid to push back against the Trump Administration's plans in other areas, but we will see if he is willing to take it so far as to deny a SCOTUS nomination. I think the most likely defectors are vulnerable GOP incumbents. Voting to confirm could very well end careers for many GOP senators like Susan Collins, Corey Gardner, or even Lindsey Graham; it only has to pressure a few of them into a no vote to block this.

,"This is an interesting post. Thank you.

1. To answer your first question, [since 1900, we’ve really not been hesitant to nominate someone for the Supreme Court because of an election year.](https://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/). 

A couple notable examples:
- March 13th, 1912: William Taft [appointed Mahlon Pitney](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/pitney-mahlon) who’s appointment was resisted by progressives. 

- President Woodrow Wilson did it twice, once in January 2, 1916, appointing Louis Brandeis (he was confirmed in June) and again in John Clarke on July 14th (he was confirmed on Jul 24th) ([source for Louis Brandeis](https://www.nytimes.com/1916/01/29/archives/brandeis-named-for-highest-court-will-be-opposed-president.html), [source for John Clarke](https://www.oyez.org/justices/john_h_clarke)
- [Herbert Hoover did it in 1932.](https://www.oyez.org/justices/benjamin_n_cardozo) [FDR nominated Frank Murphy in 1940.](https://www.oyez.org/justices/frank_murphy) and [Ronald Regan nominated Anthony Kennedy in 1987 though he was confirmed in 1988.](https://www.oyez.org/justices/anthony_m_kennedy)

In fact there are only twice a government was not able to nominate and confirm a Supreme Court justice in an election year and it was [not because of any practice against doing so](https://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/).

2. I’m not sure I’m able to pass sound judgment on this question so I’ll skip it.

3. I’m not entirely sure about a lame duck congress, especially since [house seats rarely flip anyways.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/07/house-seats-rarely-flip-from-one-party-to-the-other/) and I wouldnt expect much to change. In fact, [republicans who lost their seats were often times more moderate.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/07/house-republicans-who-lost-re-election-bids-were-more-moderate-than-those-who-won/) This might lend themselves to the idea that there is an incentive for republicans in more tough re-election bids to bite the bullet and try to confirm a nominee from president Trump as soon as they can. (Huh so I guess I answered 2 anyways)

4. The [idea of court packing has been around since at least FDR](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/roosevelt-announces-court-packing-plan). He proposed to increase the amount of justices to 15, which critics believed would neutralize the justices opposed to his New Deal. Now, this act didn’t pass, but since the National Labor Act and Social Security act were passed as constitutional, congress saw no need in passing his “Court Packing” Act. (Same source as the last one).",kookysnoopy,,ivu7dm,g5twpap
,"I am going to make the bold claim that Trump replacing RBG is not nearly the catastrophic event that many think it is.

First, I'm going to make several assumptions.

1. Trump will replace RBG's seat with someone similar to the prior two seats that have been filled.
2. Biden will win the election.
3. Biden and/or Harris will be president for at least 8 years.
4. At least one of Thomas or Alito will retire in the next 8 years and be replaced with someone similar to RBG.

For this analysis, I am relying on Martin-Quinn scores which grade justices on a Liberal-Conservative scale.  Justices receive a rating for each year on the court, and I'm using the last five years that they were/are on the court for this analysis.

Below is a table showing the five year average for each justice, as well as two hypothetical justices:

Justice | Prior 5 Year MQ Rating
---|---
AScalia | 1.7234
AMKennedy | -0.0084
RBGinsburg | -2.7606
CThomas | 3.5524
JGRoberts | 0.3336
SGBreyer | -1.6928
SAAlito | 1.8906
SSotomayor | -3.3298
EKagan | -1.1106
NMGorsuch | 0.98225
BMKavanaugh | 0.5405
RBG Replacement | .761375
Thomas Replacement | -2.7606

Below is a table of the overall court's rating as of the date of death/retirement of the past few justices, including two hypothetical replacements

Court | Overall Court Rating
---|---
As of Scalia's Death | -0.156
As of Kennedy's Retirement | -0.238
As of RBG's Death | -0.177
As of Thomas's Retirement (With hypothetical RBG Replacement) | 0.214
With Thomas's Replacement | -0.487

What we see here is that while the court will make a rather large swing to the right with RBG's replacement, assuming Thomas is replaced with a Liberal justice in the near future, we actually end up with a court that is substantially more liberal than prior to Scalia's passing.

Also note that while I picked Thomas as a replacement, Breyer is older and most likely next in line to retire, but assuming a Biden presidency, would be replaced with someone of similar leanings.  Alito and Thomas are 70 and 72, I need some time to work on the Monte Carlo simulations and will update this post accordingly when I'm done, but the odds that both live for another 8 years is low.  Moreso when you factor in declining mental faculties and other major health complications at those ages.

,"> What incentives do Republicans in tough re-election fights have prior to the election

One simple incentive is not to do the opposite of what they previously said was fair and right. Obviously one could argue that Americans have given up expecting that from their elected officials, but perhaps in a close race a candidate might become risk-averse. Here are a few of the most noteworthy Republicans:

**Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa) in 2018, when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee:** [""If I'm chairman they won't take it up ... Because I pledged that in 2016.""](https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/410686-grassley-says-judiciary-panel-wouldnt-consider-supreme-court-nominee-in) [Grassley would not be up for re-election until 2022 and has always won re-election by landslides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley#Electoral_history) so he is probably safe to reconsider his previous position.

**Sen. Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) in 2016, current Judiciary chairman:** [""I want you to use my words against me. If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.""](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/517214-democrat-on-graham-video-urging-people-to-use-my-words-against-me-done) Graham is up for re-election this year and [a recent poll](https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3673) shows him in an absolute dead heat with his Democratic opponent - not a safe seat. By presiding over the committee hearings, Graham would own their good or bad impressions more than anyone else. However, [Graham has completely reinvented himself since 2016](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/lindsey-graham-bipartisan-what-happened) so he might not feel compelled to stand by that strong assertion any more than his others from the pre-Trump era, and voters might not expect it of him.

**Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) yesterday, only hours before the announcement of Ginsburg's death:** [""I would not vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. We are 50 some days away from an election.""](https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/09/18/alaska-senator-murkowski-said-friday-she-would-not-vote-for-a-justice-ahead-of-election/) Although Murkowski is not on the Judiciary Committee and not up for re-election this year, she is widely viewed as a moderate ""swing vote"" in the full Senate, for example [during the Kavanaugh confirmation](https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/content/news/Will-Murkowski-be-a-swign-vote-on-Kavanaugh-492463531.html). The other seat in Alaska's Senate delegation is up for election this year [and early polls looked close](https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/polls/close-races-abound-in-alaska/), while Murkowski's own [electoral history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski#Electoral_history) has recently involved atypical three- and four-way splits that might not repeat (she actually won as a write-in incumbent after losing the 2010 primary), so it's hard to foresee her future.

**Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) earlier this month:** [""I think that’s too close,""](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/18/us/trump-vs-biden) referring to the possibility of voting on a new Justice in October. That's not a very strong statement but she's [so far behind](https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3673) her opponent for re-election this year that there may be no reason for the other moderate swing vote to grow a spine now.

**Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) since Ginsburg's death:** Romney is a freshman Senator who was not around for the Garland nomination in 2016, and so far he has taken no position on a potential Supreme Court vote; in fact his office has [actively disputed](https://www.bizpacreview.com/2020/09/19/grossly-false-romney-throws-cold-water-on-claim-he-wont-vote-on-scotus-nominee-until-next-year-974488) a claim that he had. Romney is the last of the three moderate swing votes, and he made his independence known when he was the [sole Republican to vote for conviction of the President](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/05/senate-impeachment-trial-mitt-romney-votes-remove-president-trump/4669734002/), so all eyes are on him. 

**Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), 2016:** [""The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.""](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/mitch-mcconnell-antonin-scalia-supreme-court-nomination-219248) (Now his Democratic counterpart Chuck Schumer has [repeated that quote verbatim](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/schumer-throws-mcconnells-words-on-scotus-vacancy-right-back-at-him) as his own comment on the matter.) McConnell is up for re-election this year and a fund broadly targeted against his control of the Senate [raised $13 million overnight](https://www.thewrap.com/defeat-mitch-mcconnell-fundraiser-13-million-after-ruth-bader-ginsburg-death/), but a recent poll says [he is in no danger of losing his own seat](https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3673), and frankly I can't imagine anyone expected him to display any consistency except the [pursuit of power](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/20/how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief):

> But when I asked John Yarmuth, the Democratic congressman from Louisville, who has known McConnell for fifty years, if McConnell had once been idealistic, he said, “Nah. I never saw any evidence of that. He was just driven to be powerful.”

> Yarmuth, who began as a Republican and worked in a statewide campaign alongside McConnell in 1968, said that McConnell had readily adapted to the Republican Party’s rightward march: “He never had any core principles. He just wants to be something. He doesn’t want to do anything.”

> For months, I searched for the larger principles or sense of purpose that animates McConnell. I travelled twice to Kentucky, observed him at a Trump rally in Lexington, and watched him preside over the impeachment trial in Washington. I interviewed dozens of people, some of whom love him and some of whom despise him. I read his autobiography, his speeches, and what others have written about him. Finally, someone who knows him very well told me, “Give up. You can look and look for something more in him, but it isn’t there. I wish I could tell you that there is some secret thing that he really believes in, but he doesn’t.”

So the question is whether that's actually a bad look. Voters might be turned off by someone who stakes out equally strong moral stances on both sides of an issue depending which is expedient when, or they might prefer someone who lies and cheats if that's what it takes to achieve their policy goals. 

---

That's a breakdown of Republicans and I'd be interested to hear about some Democrats who are now saying the opposite of what they said in 2016 as well. The [current composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate#Current_composition_and_election_results) of the Senate is 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats or independents who caucus with them, and there are those three swing votes on the majority side. But [three Democrats voted to confirm Gorsuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch_Supreme_Court_nomination#Full_Senate) and [one voted to confirm Kavanaugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh_Supreme_Court_nomination#Full_Senate) so swing votes in the minority are worth watching as well.

,"Gallaudet isn’t an HBCU though, [it’s a school for the deaf and hard of hearing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallaudet_University). I would assume that it’s because both schools are in DC and managed by the federal government, though why schools like Georgetown and GW aren’t mentioned by name I’m not sure. Interestingly if you look up all 5 schools on Wikipedia, only Howard and Gallaudet are referred to as federally chartered, the other 3 are referred to as “private research universities“. Also Georgetown is Catholic, so I find it hard to believe that it would have the same public status as the others... So I’m wondering if maybe all 5 were originally chartered, but only Howard and Gallaudet are still?

Edit: Doing some more digging I’m almost certain this is it.

This opinion happens to hold the record for longest Supreme Court opinion, and touches a lot of campaign finance topics.

,"The biggest pro to come from this deal, and the others he was involved in (Israel/Bahrain and Serbia/Kosovo) is that it illustrates that the United States is being actively involved in wordly affairs, primarily Middle Eastern, where the United States is acting as a pacifying, diplomatic force, as opposed to starting more conflicts in other areas of the world as was the case under the Obama/Bush administration. For the Middle East itself, it's obviously beneficial to have more stable working relationships between major rivals. 

So either the Trump administration looks competant enough to broker multiple deals in the Middle East, or they get to ride the coattails of a larger middle eastern peace movement. 

Cons to this deal only seem to be that more countries are not involved, or that it happened under a trump administration. Under a more normal United States administration this could be seen as a major stepping stone, but because of how close it is to the US election this will largely be seen by Trump critics in the United States as an electoral move. This is only in the United States, however, in the global sphere it seems reasonable that Trump would be in the running to successfully win the peace prize, considering that other diplomatic leaders haven't accomplished anything as noteworthy as the two middle east deals and presiding over the Serbia/Kosovo one.

,"Interesting piece to add to your question above in an edit: apparently Israel and Bahrain have made a deal as well just this last hour. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54124996

With regards to the deals themselves - UAE has 8 million population, Bahrain 2 million, Israel 8 million. 

Does Trump deserve a Nobel Peace Prize for the above? UAE and Saudi Arabia are both starting to enrich Uranium, and he tore up the Iran Deal which meant that Iran could not build a nuclear weapon in a volatile region of the world (and he has increased U.S. nuclear weapon stockpiles). 

So just on the basis of nuclear proliferation, Trump does not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize, given that nuclear weapons are the number 1 threat to world destruction since their invention, and under Trump, two oil-rich nations are starting to enrich Uranium for ""energy purposes"" in a volatile region, violent conflict between the U.S./Israel and Iran is more likely than ever, and the U.S. has increased its nuclear stockpile. On the other existential issue, climate change, Trump has denied that it's even real publicly and has ripped up the Paris Climate Accord and been working to increase and exasperate the coming climate crisis. Those are the two issues which can be described as potential existential threats to all life on Earth. Just on those issues alone, I personally don't think he deserves to win the Nobel Peace Prize because of a deal with two countries that aren't the U.S. that didn't particularly have a rocky relationship to begin with, and have been rather neutral with each other.

With regards to the positives or negatives of the deals themselves, there's a lot that hasn't been made public about what these deals contain, outside of the recognition of Israel, and the Middle East is a complicated region with 18-30 nations, and how this affects the geopolitical structure of the region is fairly complicated to suss out, especially given the fact that the details of the deals haven't been explicitly stated. 

So my take with regards to the pros and cons of the deal is, it's not going to be apparent for at least a few years. 

My other take is that any “big” news from now until 2 months later has an electoral purpose for the U.S. election, including any treaties.",NicolasName,,iqmw8f,g4v43zd
,"I would like to contribute to this conversation by offering a comparison to, of course, none other than Obama. Obama is known for drone attacks and collateral damage. Both in the literal sense and the piece of media released by WikiLeaks thru Chelsea Manning. Much violence in the Mid-East brought about by someone who initially campaigned on the idea that our forces would start leaving the region, namely Afghanistan. This was mostly done after he was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace prize. A large part of the prize was awarded because he attempted denuclearization as many have done before.

In regards to Trump, I would say of course it is implied that he, too, should not get the Nobel Peace Prize - and for a plethora of reasons, namely the children held in border camps. On this I would say, the recent negotiations, and decisions in general, for both Obama and Trump, have multiple people playing their parts.

For example, Henry Kissinger was Nixon's Sec of State and heavily involved/delegated to foreign affairs. He won half of a Nobel Peace prize, too, for negotiating a ceasefire. Realpolitik abounds. See the link to the Nobel website for details on his award.

I hope this provides insight to the discussion, please let me know if I can add anything

So hopefully this may show you any bias I have towards any groups in this story.

I think that the deal is mostly just to serve Trump and nothing else. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been know to have backdoor channels and indirect contact with the ""Israelis"" and this has been on hyperdrive  since MBS  ame into power in Saudi Arabia and when MBZ became the de facto ruler of the UAE. Trump definitely wasn't a negotiator, he was the endgame of the deal.

The ""Israelis"" and the ""Emiratis"" have never been so happy to find someone like Donald Trump that does everything they want:

* Turn a blind eye on Yemen and how the UAE is neo-colonizing it (could even say they actually colonized Socotra island) ? Check.
* Turn a blind eye about how Israel is helping the UAE in Yemen to commit atrocities and mass surveillance? Check.
* Turn a blind eye into Bibi's fascist-fest? Check.
* Turn a blind eye into how the UAE is trying to build alliances with China and Russia? Check.

And so on and forth. If it was another President other than Trump these would not have happened or at least nt on the scale they are in right now.

So Tl;dr, the deal was made to make Trump look as a ""peacemaker"" so that he can possibly win a second term. Which to me seems to me we can add these two governments with the current list of Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and China that want to try and influence U.S elections.

,"I think from watching movies like “The 13th,” most Americans have a distorted sense of how many people are incarcerated publicly versus privately (at least that’s what I personally thought).

[At least as of 2016,](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/capitalizing-on-mass-incarceration-u-s-growth-in-private-prisons/) 90% of people were being held in federal prisons, whereas 73% people in immigrant detention centers were held privately. Although, something important to consider that isn’t touched on by this source is how many people are processed in each type of prison respectively— versus actively being held— that might affect the numbers but I imagine federal prisons would still dwarf the numbers.

In McDonald 1994, he notes that most prisons were private but began the transition from private to public in the late 19th and early 20th. In terms of why we privatized in the 20th century, reducing government costs and relying on the market for solutions were a factor, but dealing with overcrowding and immigrant detention were others. McDonald notes that contracting deals and special payment arrangements were used to establish private prisons or detention centers quickly which, if the individual US states had gone through the regular process, would have taken much longer than what actually took place. 

Based on the first source, the size of the private population fluctuates greatly from state to state, but each state has its own relationship with private imprisonment, eg some states are effectively “leasing” the license to imprison or contracting for “beds;” some states consider yearly or whenever contracts expire if they should buy the private facilities and run them themselves. With this in mind, states more often pay for private prisons because — in theory — their facilities were poorly run or did not have capacity; nevertheless, most privately incarcerated people were held by state private prisons and not federally contracted ones.

In McDonald, he was skeptical in 1994 that studies comparing the costs and benefits of private imprisonment had room for improvement, ie because they didn’t accurately understand the different ways public and private institutions run their books or record their costs. However, many state administrations and third party scholars have evaluated the costs （and although they do come to some mixed conclusions), the state is not really saving money per se because they are still paying private prisons for their services while the prisons themselves generate “profit” by:

- underpaying and denying benefits to prison employees

- shirking on amenities for prisoners

- profits from prison labor

Because of this, arguably prison worker’s unions are a big obstacle to privatization and the real lack of a huge cost benefit to the state or tax payer complicates the issue.

Given his professed protestant background, this is pretty odd.  Whereas most US Catholics don't read the Bible much less memorize specific verses, it's a pretty common thing for US protestants.  For those who aren't Christian, Trump's response to this question is basically the equivalent of someone saying they love baseball, but when you ask them what team they like, refuse to give an answer except to say that they like all teams equally.  If nothing else, he could have spoke about a specific Bible story, like Noah's ark or Moses in Egypt.

Even with that said, there is significant evidence that Trump is not at all religious. [This NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2016/01/18/463528847/citing-two-corinthians-trump-struggles-to-make-the-sale-to-evangelicals) details a few facts about Trump's religiosity to give context to his infamous quotation of ""Two Corinthians."" The book is called Second Corinthians or, in full, The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians. This is anecdotal, but I have never known anybody with any familiarity with the Bible to refer to it as anything other than Second Corinthians. Certainly any ecclesiastical leader citing a scripture from the book would know what to call it, and someone regularly attending church services or lessons would hear the correct name often. EDIT: u/theobromus has posted a [link](https://community.logos.com/forums/t/125915.aspx) revealing the ethnocentrism of my anecdote. I'm going to leave it up with the caveat that it is common to say ""Two Corinthians"" in the UK, and Trump may have picked it up from his mother, an immigrant from Scotland. I would subjectively add that his tone when saying it and the lack of later clarification still imply that it was said from ignorance rather than different tradition, but it is certainly not as definitive as it seems at first glance.

Trump also claimed to attend Marble Collegiate Church, a Presbytarian church in Manhattan, but the church released a statement clarifying that [he is not an active member](https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/28/politics/donald-trump-church-member/index.html). Trump also has gone on record answering a question about asking God for forgiveness by saying that he [is ""not sure"" he has ever done that](https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/politics/trump-has-never-sought-forgiveness/). This is a strange answer, as it is an established precept of Christianity that all humans are flawed and must ask God for forgiveness for their sins and repent (this is indicated in the Bible, in passages such as 1 John 1:9).

It is true that it is not possible to know exactly what someone truly believes. In the case of Trump, we can at least conclude that he has not participated very actively in the Christian worship that generally defines the very religious.

I know quite a lot less about Joe Biden except that many report him to be a Catholic who attends Mass weekly and often wears the religiously symbolic rosary beads from his deceased son, Beau.

**Conclusion**

If Donald Trump is personally religious he's not trying very hard to dupe you that he is.  If Joe Biden isn't personally religious he is trying really hard to dupe you into believing he is.  Ultimately religion is something that is personal and finding signs as to whether or not a person is or is not religious is going to be impossible.  The only person that knows if Donald Trump is religious is Donald Trump.  The only person who knows if Joe Biden is religious is Joe Biden.

And *he thought to himself*, ‘What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?’ Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. *And I will say to my soul*, “‘Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.” ’ But God said to him, ‘You fool!

I could talk about the repeated allegations of sexualized comments about underaged girls, including his own daughter. Those don't strike me as the choices that would be made by someone who was interested in presenting themselves as pious.

UK here. Forgive me for picking up on this, but I would like to point out how odd this is from an UK / European viewpoint.   Religion is a more private matter here. 

Actual information on religious preferences of the Members of the UK Parliament is hard to find, but a 2015 survey of [225 electoral candidates](https://www.whitehouseconsulting.co.uk/blog/2015/04/17/survey-shows-marginal-seat-candidates-will-be-white-male-and-only-somewhat-religious/) (i.e. people who have passed their party electoral selection process) found: 

>Less than four in ten (37 percent) confirmed they believed in a deity, with a third (33.78 percent) claiming to be atheist. More than four in ten candidates (42 percent) claimed to have no religious denomination \[...\]  
>  
>The findings follow a recent Win/Gallup poll that found that only 30 percent of Britons claimed to be religious \[..\]  
>  
>“Given recent findings on Britain’s religious beliefs, it’s unsurprising that a majority of parliamentary candidates are either non-religious or atheist.”  
>  
>The Green Party (49 percent), followed by Labour (48 percent) was found to have the highest percentages of atheist candidates. 

[A tiny sample of 26 MPs](https://www.atheismuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ResultsMPscampaign2.pdf) in 2012 found that 6 of the 26 or 23% openly described themselves as atheist.  Three more identified themselves as 'no longer religious' (lapsed). Adding that on gives 34% or potentially a full third of Parliament.  

Several more stated that their beliefs were a private matter, or that they voted the party line on all manifesto commitments, and only voted according to their beliefs when a free vote was given.  (i.e. manifesto before religion. 

Another interesting quote from that report: 

>That the majority of MPs did not reply to our questionnaire is perhaps an indication that openly stating ones religious beliefs in the world of politics where votes count is still a delicate subject.

,"I think I would challenge the preface of your question.

As you mention (and source) , there are correlations between how people vote and the perception of religiosity of the candidate.

But none of those sources mention any sort of objective measurement of one's religious level.  As you said, *every* candidate in history has claimed an affiliation with some religion.  But none of them have been asked to *prove* it.


So my point is that, the only thing that is really relevant here is *perception* of the voters.


Even within the religious community, support for candidates are skewed heavily along racial and ethnic lines within the same religion.  And none of them cite religious believability as the reason for their support.  It is just a broad assumption that the candidate is good for them/people like them, or not good for them.

,"It's very common for larger departments to have at least a few federally deputized officers. Generally this is specifically for anti-gang, drug, and human smuggling investigations, but I've seen them used for other things as well though(for example there's apparently a federal law on carjacking).

I don't know exactly what federal laws they would be able to enforce, but the biggest impact I see this having is the consequences for the protestors and rioters themselves. Federal sentences ~~are day for day (so no early parole, etc)~~ do not allow parole, have very strict rules for getting good time credit, and don't have any other ability for early release that are typically available in state cases. Additionally, the jury is pulled from a much wider area so they're far less likely to have a sympathetic jury made up exclusively of jurors from within the same liberal county.

I think it's far more likely that as state police they will be enforcing local laws, knowing full well the local DA has no intent to prosecute, but then charge rioters with far more serious federal charges for the actions they take against officers which will also carry much harsher sentences.

No because both the state and federal government have arresting/charging powers and in these cases, the Federal Attorney would not be charging the arrested with state charges but federal charges and the Federal government is not compelling the DA to charge these people for federal crimes. I don't think cross-deputizing crosses this line either, as OSP was already arresting people.

I have a limited basis for the following, but here is my interpretation of what that third house would be.

Consider the possibility of a third house, which is representative of not the population, not the states, but the various occupations and specializations that people work.  The intent of this body would be to balance the needs of the populace, and the states with the expertise of various fields of work.  I consider this house to be a ""balance"" against corruption, where people selected from all professions vote on issues.  It would be similar to jury duty, but for government work.  You and others get randomly selected to represent your profession, and get paid the working salary you already get paid to vote on policy similar to the house and Senate.  I believe it would also work as a counterbalance to the bipartisan struggle to control the house and Senate majority.

There is some interesting and related work being done with juries, where people are looking at the distribution of professions among jury bodies.  I believe that work of this nature could help to provide a basis for the selection of various professions of all kinds.

""the overrepresentation on the jury lists occurs mostly in the professional, man-agerial and sales occupations.
4 Underrepresentation oc-curs mostly among the craftsmen, operatives, service workers and laborers.""

Furthermore, many Americans believe that ordinary people could do a better job than politicians(both for clear cut, and difficult problems).

""Among the 41% of the public who say there are clear solutions to the big issues facing the country, fully 63% say they think ordinary Americans would do a better job than elected officials solving the country’s problems.

,"To understand why tricameralism dies and bicameralism survives, we must understand why bicameralism happens, why tricameralism happens, and what  function this kind of legislative segmentation serves.

In England, the Parliament developed out of the King's court which included the highest nobles and clergy. Eventually, it became evident that knights of high renown should be allowed in this body as well. Soon, the knights and the others in parliament found that they had very different views on things, and the knights got their own house ([source](https://www.history.com/topics/british-history/british-parliament)).

In Pre-revolutionary France, the Estates General was divided similarly, but the clergy and lords got their own houses. Very little power was granted to the Estates General, and of the little that was given not very much was given to the poor. The First (clergy) and Second (Lords) Estates could gang up on the Third (commoners) Estate, rendering it worthless, and it turned out that the first two estates had a lot in common in the way of interests as opposed to the third ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_General_(France))).

The reason bicameralism serves to facilitate a discussion between the rich and poor, so they can create policy that is stable. If there is no discussion, and the poor are voiceless, as seen in France's example, then the system devolves into revolution. If there is no discussion, and the rich are voiceless as seen in post revolutionary France (all the rich were guillotined), then the system devolves into terror. If both check each other, then there is a balance.

The reason this balance works (normally) is that the discussion is even more profound than just between haves and havenots; it is between merit and equality which are mutually exclusive forms of fairness. A merited person is treated better because he has shown competence, and once this differential treatment happens, society is unequal. However, if society is equal, then those with merit are insufficiently motivated to strive to be the best they can be, so merit is eliminated. If those who have merit can have a discussion with those who have perspective, then fair decisions can be made out of those discussions.

It is difficult to see how tricameralism would add to this process. In the past, there were tricameral systems based on race (Apartheid South Africa) and ethnicity (the Croatian Yugoslav Republic), but that sparked racial and ethnic tension as each group tried to dunk on the others ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricameralism)).

Unicameralism can side step all of this discussion and get laws passed more efficiently, but that lack of discussion is often the reason most societies with a unicameral legislature are not as free as those with a bicameral legislature. Of course there are societies with bicameral legislatures that are unfree as well, and some societies are free despite their unicameral legislature, but the norm is that the former is better for liberty and the former is less so (compare this [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism#/media/File:Unibicameral_Map.svg) with this [map](https://freedomhouse.org/explore-the-map?type=fiw&year=2020)).",bellicae,,ijmdny,g3fsrym

The main reason he cited is that it's structurally unrepresentative: each state has two senators regardless of population, so different senators represent vastly different numbers of constituents, and it's actually possible for the majority party in the Senate to represent a minority of the population. 

But, as Dingell noted, the Senate exists because of a [compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise) made to convince smaller states to sign the new constitution.

Basically, large organizations, like sports teams and political parties, can purchase what's called a ""blanket license.""

In the past, that's usually meant the artist will make a public request or disavowel of the organization that's using the work, at which point, to avoid public embarrassment, the organization will cease and desist. The thinking by those organizations has been that you don't want to be playing music by Joe & the Schmos if they've come out against you.

,"This is an open question until both the Court rules on such a case and the implications of their ruling play out.  Ultimately we are left to conjecture.

If the Court were to find that it has the authority to block a contingency election, then this would no doubt create a ""Constitutional crises"".  It would leave the word of Congress against the word of the Court.

But it is far more likely that the Court would not do so, instead finding the case to fall under the [Political Question doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_question), which basically means that Court doesn't find the case to be non-justiciable under its Constitutional authority. The Court elaborated the criteria for applying the political question doctrine during [Baker v Carr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Carr), several of which could be applicable to the subject of this thread:  


>\[Cases with\] ""Textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department;""

What this is saying is that Political Question doctrine applies if the issue in question is already delegated to another branch of government by the Constitution.  In this case, the contingency election is delegated to the House under the 12th Amendment.  This is, imho, the most likely determination by the Court.  


>""The impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of  government;""

Similar to the previous criteria, this basically says that the Court must respect the Separation of Powers.

&#x200B;

>""An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made;""

This one basically says that Court finds it unnecessary (and therefore a political question) to reverse an issue that has already been committed to.  Basically a form of ""when in doubt, leave it be"".

&#x200B;

>""The potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.""

In other words, the Court seeks to avoid creating any ""Constitutional crises"" where two branches are making contrasting decrees.  Different branches declaring different Presidential winners very likely falls under this.

&#x200B;

We can see the application of this doctrine in constraining the scope of the Court's authority over the other branches on similar issues:  


* An [impeachment cannot be challenged](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/us/trump-impeachment-supreme-court.html) in the Courts.

* The [Speech & Debate Clause](https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3211&context=lawreview) shields Congress from any Court interference into legislative matters.  This recently came up in [Trump v Mazars](https://www.subscriptlaw.com/blog/trump-v-mazars), where the clause prevents the Court from second guessing the 'legislative purpose' of the House.

&#x200B;

I actually think a more interesting question would be the reverse:  What happens if the House actually *refuses* to hold the contingency election?  Let's say that Republicans in a few swing states are able to prevent a majority winner in the Electoral College, thus throwing the contingency election to the House with the aim of having a majority of Republican dominated delegations elect Trump.  However, let's say that the House Dems retain their majority and decide to play dirty as well: they decide that there will be no contingency election because the House Majority will not bring that vote to the House floor.

,"As far as I can tell, 18 U.S.C. 1701 was not written to cover official actions inhibiting the delivery of the mail. It was first passed in 1948, then amended in 1994 as a part of the Crime Bill. The cases I've scanned over just now (in what is admittedly a brief survey) involve defendants who were directly tampering with their neighbor's mail, or at worst, a postal worker stealing stuff (see [*US v. Weldon*, 2019 WL 6529186 (E.D. Cal. 2019)](https://casetext.com/case/weldon-v-united-states-21).

So let's take Trump's statements as reported in those articles and consider them in context, then attempt to apply them to the statute. Contextually, the President has stated that he believes mail-in voting is susceptible to fraud (except in Florida). This is highly debatable at best, as the Guardian points out. But the statute's intent element doesn't care about any justification. It only requires that an act be done ""knowingly and willfully.""

The President has said,

> ""They need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots... If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.""

and

> ""If we don’t make a deal that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting. They just can’t have it. Sort of a crazy thing...""

Well, it is what it is, as the man says. So does this language, and the act of withholding the funds, apply to the statute?

We'd have to apply statutory canons of interpretation to figure out what ""obstruct or retard"" mean in this context. Case law doesn't seem helpful, so perhaps we could look at the intent of those who wrote the bill in 1948 and those who amended it in 1994.

The president isn't allowed to violate the law, however, the mechanism for holding the president accountable for breaking the law is flawed. Traditionally the president never willfully violated the law to the extent that the current president does so with the complete backing of one political party.

,"From a purely ethical standpoint, violently enforcing liberal values does strike one as something of an oxymoron. The bush doctrine, as you mentioned, is at the very least hypocritical. Of course the argument could be made that liberal values are considered the pinnacle of societal development, and thus that all people would welcome intervention that enforces such values (eventually). It is doubtful, however, that countries would willingly allow other nations to infringe upon their sovereignty; article 2 of the UN’s Charter states that ‘[The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members] (https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html)’ and ‘[Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter Vll.](https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/index.html)

I was discussing with a friend how democracy cannot forbid the people from choosing to abolish it - if the constitution enforces a single system with no exit, is it really that liberal? The electoral body should embrace democracies because they want to, not because they are forced to. The issue at hand is rather similar, I think. Liberal democracies should in effect lead by example, not force. This is of course a matter of opinion.

Liberal theory in international relations postulates that mature democracies very rarely in armed conflict with each other [(democratic peace theory)](https://www.e-ir.info/2012/02/18/the-democratic-peace-theory/). The end result, if all countries were forcefully converted to liberal values, would be, theoretically, a peaceful world. There is however the question of whether such forceful reorganisations would result in mature democracies, again there is the issue of breaching sovereignty.

For a definite con, I would say democratic leaders, who are accountable to their electoral bases, might be hesitant to engage significant means in enforcing their values overseas; for example, most Americans think the US failed to achieve it’s objectives in [Afghanistan](https://www.google.fr/amp/s/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/05/after-17-years-of-war-in-afghanistan-more-say-u-s-has-failed-than-succeeded-in-achieving-its-goals/%3famp=1).

* Minimum wages generally increase income levels among low-income workers (ie, wage increase isn't offset by less employment opportunities or less hours available)
* Higher minimum wages incur only marginal inflation on the economy
* Minimum wage would not affect those who are unemployed, so EITC changes as an alternative/supplement are also a good idea to help those people

The key points:

> electors who are sent postal ballot packs rather than voting in person in the controlled environment of a polling station could still be subjected to pressure or undue influence to vote in a particular way against their wishes. Ballot packs which are delivered or returned by post may also be delayed by interruptions to the postal service, which could mean that postal votes are received too late to be counted by ROs

> Limiting the availability of postal voting would reduce the risk of fraud: with fewer postal votes it would be harder for a corrupt candidate or their supporter to coordinate a sufficiently large number of fraudulent votes to influence the result of an election. It would not, however, eliminate that risk completely, particularly at local government elections where the margin of victory for ward elections is often relatively small.

However;

> We do not believe that returning to the restricted availability of postal voting in Great Britain, to only those who could give a valid and attested explanation why they are unable to vote in person at a polling station, would be a proportionate response to the vulnerabilities that we have identified.

> The impact on participation of restricting the availability of postal voting in Great Britain would, on the other hand, be significant. We could expect the proportion of electors sent a postal ballot pack to reduce significantly. Before the law was changed to allow greater access to postal voting in Great Britain, only 4% of electors were issued with a postal vote; only 1.4% of electors in Northern Ireland were sent a postal ballot pack at the May 2010 UK Parliamentary general election. [It was 15% for Great Britain in the 2010 GE] Restricting the availability of postal voting on demand would remove the freedom for electors to choose a convenient method of voting. Great Britain would be out of line with common practice in most other comparable democracies if it did not provide alternative options for electors to vote in advance of polling day.",TheHolyLordGod,,iac3r5,g1nwty0

(A short blurb about Eastman's campaign was added to the original page nine hours after the Editor's Note, and the next day another Editor's Note was prepended on the original article apologizing that Newsweek had not foreseen that other people would use the article to perpetuate racism.)

The first Editor's Note refers to Eastman as ""a preeminent constitutional scholar widely associated with the legal argument"" against birthright citizenship, i.e. Eastman has been arguing for years that children of noncitizens born in the US should not be granted automatic citizenship, as they have been.

And if any of those things happened, they would retroactively revoke the citizenship of [millions of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2010/08/11/unauthorized-immigrants-and-their-us-born-children/), and Kamala Harris would no longer be [eligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate#Qualifications\)) for the position she already holds in the US Senate - yet no one thought to file a constitutional challenge to her 55-year US citizenship in any of her previous political campaigns.

The answer is that Newsweek is no longer a respectable publication. [It died in 2018](https://slate.com/technology/2018/02/what-went-wrong-at-newsweek-according-to-current-and-former-staffers.html) when it fired some of its top journalists who were reporting on a criminal investigation of its parent company's financial irregularities and connections to a controversial religious sect, leading to a series of public resignations. After the dust had settled, the [Columbia Journalism Review](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/newsweek.php) summed up Newsweek's descent into a clickbait farm: ""No one working at Newsweek can tell me why it still exists."" 

So this question comes from a wackadoodle constitutional pipe dream published for clicks in the lifeless husk of a former news outlet and amplified by the President of the United States. His supporters discredit themselves by taking it seriously, and perhaps even the critics are doing the national discourse a disservice by giving it any attention. We are all stupider for having considered it.",Epistaxis,,i9zt93,g1j0qfk
,">There is no such requirement for taking office as the Vice President. However, following the United States presidential line of succession, can a vice president who is not a natural-born citizen take office, in the case of if the president is not able to hold office in any capacity?

This is not the case, [Article II, Sec. 1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section1) of the US constitution outlines the process to elect the President. Until the 12th amendment, the first-place winner was President and the second-place winner was the vice president. There hasn't been any formal change to the requirements since then aside from the 12th amendment (which puts both the president and vice president on the same ticket), so the President and Vice President have the same requirements in order to apply for office.

I should also mention, its incredibly unlikely a non-citizen would ever make it through the qualification process. There are many legal documents you have to file in order to even appear on the ballot. Best case if you get found out you're in for perjury, worst case treason.",thesia,,i9zt93,g1il9b7

&#x200B;

>Were Harris' parents lawful permanent residents *at the time* of her birth? If so, then under the actual holding of *Wong Kim Ark*, she should be deemed a citizen at birth—that is, a natural-born citizen—and hence eligible. Or were they instead, as seems to be the case, merely temporary visitors, perhaps on student visas issued pursuant to Section 101(15)(F) of Title I of the 1952 Immigration Act? If the latter were indeed the case, then derivatively from her parents, Harris was *not* subject to the *complete* jurisdiction of the United States at birth, but instead owed her allegiance to a foreign power or powers—Jamaica, in the case of her father, and India, in the case of her mother—and was therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment as originally understood.

[This](https://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/john-mccains-presidential-eligibility/) website has a good summary of the first three.

Barry Goldwater was born in the Arizona Territory before it was a state.  George Romney was born in Mexico to American parents.  John McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone to American parents.

Ted Cruz’s [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz) page describes his childhood.  He was born in Canada to a Cuban father and American mother.  His father became a naturalized Canadian citizen.  Ted Cruz moved to the U.S. (Texas) when he was 4 years old.  His father became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005.  Ted Cruz’s U.S. citizenship only comes from his mother being American.

Exit polls and pre-election voter polls have been used to intentionally sway future voters into voting a specific way, but that’s a different issue. 

The best tools that we have available are audits of paper ballots, and more specifically [risk limiting audits.](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/checking-the-election-risk-limiting-audits.aspx). Election outcomes HAVE been overturned based on the results of various types of paper-based audits (there’s a bunch of rules and it’s a rabbit hole where every state uses the same word to refer to different audit types - yay decentralized elections?). Only a few states require risk limiting audits at this point, which are the new cheap, and statistically validated gold standard that states are slowly moving towards. Using exit polls to verify election outcomes is security theatre. 

In terms of verifying that the individual casting the ballot is the person who we hope, the documentation sent along with ballots in some states (e.g., pic of drivers license) and comparing the signature on file against the signature on the ballot affidavit is the best tool we have for that. Obviously the voter’s address has to be on file with the election office in order to receive the ballot in the first place as well, but the sig is where the rubber meets and road. Sig verification is done via both automated and manual methods based on the resources and technical acumen of the individual county, township, parrish, borough that you live and vote in.

When an elector has requested an absentee ballot, that ballot will be prepared and sent to them, and in the voter registration log it will be noted that they requested an absentee ballot.  In this case they will have to vote by a provisional ballot, which gets placed in individually marked envelopes and kept separate from the normal ballots.

After the election, the board of elections will process all of the provisional ballots and will check whether that voter has already voted absentee or not (i.e. did the BOE receive and process their ballot).  If so, then their absentee ballot will be counted and their provisional ballot will be discarded.

See [Ohio Revised Code §3505.181\(A\)\(3\)](https://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3505.181) for eligibility to vote provisional if they've already requested an absentee ballot, and [Ohio Revised Code §3505.183\(B\)\(4\)\(iv\)](https://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3505.183v1) stating that if an individual has already cast a ballot (i.e. absentee), the envelope will not be opened and the provisional vote will not count.",xNaVx,,i7gfoz,g1kwk0t

I'm sharing these charts with very little analysis. Frankly, I'm not an expert in state fiscal policy and I did this research in a rush before dinner. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this other than ""There is a correlation between high state taxes and residents of those states living longer"".

There is \*not\*, however, any evidence of a causal relationship. There could be any number of factors involved, for instance: states with higher taxes have stricter emissions laws and there is strong evidence that air quality is a significant factor in human longevity. I'm not saying this is the case, just giving it as an example of how you can't draw a causal relationship purely between the higher tax revenues and the longevity of a state's residents.

As other commenters pointed out this also doesn't extend to all aspects of a state's fiscal policy - CA has one of the lowest spends per capita on road maintenance, for example.

This is how the United States [can consistently spend as much or more as other countries](https://www.vox.com/2015/3/25/8284637/school-spending-US) and still lag behind them in outcomes: schools are forced to provide [all manner of wraparound mental health](https://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=luc_diss) and [social services for students](https://www.insider.com/us-states-with-the-highest-number-of-children-dependent-on-free-lunch)—[particularly students in poverty](https://www.oecd.org/els/CO_2_2_Child_Poverty.pdf)—to which they are not well suited and which would be provided, in almost any other peer country, by an entity other than a school. As such, [while the literature has been very clear that more spending is helpful](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20847.pdf), it's not enough on its own—especially when funding for one segment of social welfare provision is done to the exclusion of others.

This disconnect between the headline numbers of how much a state spends and the outcomes we get is absolutely central to understanding your original question and also gets at why it may be impossible to answer definitively (though there is a lot of suggestive evidence).

Looking at only social spending, the United States *looks* like it spends less generously on social services than other peer countries. However, according to the [Peterson Institute on international economics](https://www.piie.com/sites/default/files/publications/pb/pb15-4.pdf), once you account for private sector subsidies and ""expenditures"" by way of tax cuts, the United States actually spends *more* than most peer countries on social services. So, it's not so much that the United States spends *less*, we just spend our social welfare dollars in [ineffective ways](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/09/how-the-u-s-spends-more-helping-its-citizens-than-other-rich-countries-but-gets-way-less/). 

This is relevant at the state level because not only are there [divergences in how much states spend on their programmatic offerings overall](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/public-welfare-expenditures), but also in *how* they spend them, with more conservative-leaning states tending to favor social welfare by way of [tax cuts](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp08-03bk.pdf) and [enterprise zones](https://aresjournals.org/doi/abs/10.5555/jhor.10.2.3611n152n1841045) despite an empirical record that is [extremely dubious](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0160017609341385?casa_token=29njqO8lZPkAAAAA:8jZiQKF7nyDhNYQKRrKSJO-whbvGA4cYC2_QcG_qDARVPdYbP3ZbxiHnbwsJid_fz9Oj2rt16l8) that these mechanisms have any merit at all. It should be noted, though, that *all* states, blue and red alike, tend to favor social welfare by way of private provision and tax cuts more than the typical rich peer country in the world—the question is usually by how much. 

As such, just looking at expenditures in a vacuum tells a really misleading story which means a ready answer to your question remains elusive. I would (with as much respect as possible) push back a bit on the premise of your question by suggesting that it may be time for us to focus less on taxation as a mechanism that drives political behavior or policy outcomes. It is an important policy tool—maybe the most important policy tool—but it is still only one of many. There are a great many analyses and articles online [parse out which states have the lowest taxes](https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/taxes/t054-s001-10-most-tax-friendly-states-in-the-u-s-2019/index.html) or which imply that taxation should be [a central consideration](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20180925174436/2019-State-Business-Tax-Climate-Index.pdf) in, for instance, starting a business. And yet, the available evidence suggests that [shared values, psychological drivers, geographical amenities and quality of public services delivered](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Big_Sort.html?id=mbjOZTx9u_cC) drives where we choose to live way more than how cheaply those services are delivered. The story of whether you get better services for your tax dollar is complicated by the fact that tax dollars are spent in wildly different ways state by state and I think, therefore, looking more holistically at service delivery and quality of life is more beneficial and more accurate than an input-output question about taxes in vs. services out.",matthew_record,,i7iax4,g14l0kl
,"I haven’t analyzed it state by state, but I know in Nevada, if you look at your link above, they are one of the highest rates of taxes coming from regressive tax policies (sales tax, unemployment tax) and one of the lowest for taxes that are progressive and affect wealthy people (corporate tax, property tax, income tax). 

When I was an educator there, we were also 50th out of 50 states in terms of education outcomes. 

My take was that the casino owners like Sheldon Adelson had beyond incredible sway over the local and state politics of that state, and everything is geared towards their interests. Small taxes on casinos could go a long way towards revitalizing Las Vegas and the rest of Nevada, but it doesn’t happen. And they don’t really want or need an educated workforce - the casino owners want people who would take low paying jobs on the strip.

I moved from OH to CA and my wages stayed relatively the same. Acoording to the list in the OP, OH is has higher taxes than CA.  But that wasn't our experience. Every aspect of our lives got noticeably more expensive, including taxes.

As for the quality of services... The two biggest shocks for me personally were education and pollution/environmental stuff.

When we were moving, we looked at education and saw that CA was ranked 21 and OH was ranked 31.  [Source](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education) So we felt good about our decision.

But when we got here, both of our kids were *way* ahead of their classes.  And we moved from a slightly above average district in OH to a top 10 public school district in CA.

Then when we looked into it more, we found out that CA universities score highly (CA #4, OH #38 [Source ](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education/higher-education)) , but K-12 scores pretty poorly.  OH ranks 18th, but CA ranks 37th. [Source ](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education/prek-12)

Now for the legality of the federal law that is a problem in that most of the action US Congress wants states to perform is not allowed under the separation of the US Constitution.  Since they cannot directly force the states to do something the way Congress gets around that promise the states money if they pass their own laws to enforce that action.

>4. What is the period for which employers can defer deposit and payment of the employer's share of Social Security tax without incurring failure to deposit and/or failure to pay penalties?

>Under sections 2302(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the CARES Act, employers may defer deposits of the employer's share of Social Security tax due during the ""payroll tax deferral period"" and payments of the tax imposed on wages paid during that period. The payroll tax deferral period begins on March 27, 2020 and ends December 31, 2020.

From the memo:

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=header

>Sec. 2.  Deferring Certain Payroll Tax Obligations.  The Secretary of the Treasury is hereby directed to use his authority pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7508A to defer the withholding, deposit, and payment of the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 3101(a), and so much of the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 3201 as is attributable to the rate in effect under 26 U.S.C. 3101(a), on wages or compensation, as applicable, paid during the period of September 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, subject to the following conditions:

,"so these look like lots of pretty different things. I'll try to address the differences and try to answer some of the questions. but because this is really a huge issue it will take too long to address each thing. 

in the first case we are suggesting that states use funds from the CARES act (refereed to as CRF in the EO) and the stafford act (FEMA money /DRF). This doesn't come with any enforcement criteria, but allows money for addressing corona virus disaster relief  to be sent to people via state unemployment, which might or might not be applicable in the cares and stafford act. 

In the second case the EO will have the treasury stop collecting payroll taxes from people who weekly make less than $4k from sept 1 to dec 31 2020. this is classified as a deferment but notes that it will ask for legislation to make it a relief. we note that the fiscal year is over in sept 30.

The third doesn't stop foreclosures or evictions, it suggests that HUD look into what funds it can make available to people struggling with housing and also asks HUD to look into what it can do in terms of limiting evictions. it also wants the CDC director to confirm that the CDC's stance is that homelessness is bad for disease spread to HUD.

the last point extend student loan deferment until December 31. I'm gonna note that I don't know how the student loan budget is handled as in i'm not sure if it is loans owned by banks that are under strict regulation or if it is owned by the feds and a budgetary item. in this way I won't make any comment about this order.

[What the congress thinks of the budget.](https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/09902056-79c6-4355-b37d-e946dec57c17.pdf)

note that in article 1 ""No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time."" meaning that congress is the one who gets to interpret how budgets are kept. 

* Question 1: so we will note section ""Execution of Appropriations and Other Enacted Budgetary Legislation"" in ""What the congress thinks of the budget."" (page 9 of pdf page 6 by label) that collection of funds is in the scope of the budget and that the executive is responsible for enacting this. I'll note that an argument might be made that the collections are already fucked and that this isn't within the scope of corrections, as the economy has had 2 quarters with a combined loss of real gdp of 36.2% since the year started. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A191RL1Q225SBEA But, taking an action that may limit the scope of collecting taxes during the fiscal year may result in lower collections might put the executive on the hook for all of that revenue loss.


* question 2: I will note that there wasn't a specific mandate as no enforcement was put forward. but these will be found in the CARES act and stafford act.

* question 3: the stafford act is basically funds from FEMA that are allocated to address natural disasters so it is using these funds in response to the economic impacts of the corona virus. So, like these funds are out of the same budget item that go to hurricane relief projects, wildfire relief, etc.",tjdavids,,i6rnzu,g111v5i
,"In executive power cases, it's very hard to say exactly what the limits of the president's powers are.  Ultimately, the president can do anything he can get away with, and the constraints are as much political as legal. If you want to read something written by an expert in the area, see these [two](https://www.lawfareblog.com/tiktok-and-law-primer-case-you-need-explain-things-your-teenager) [posts](https://www.lawfareblog.com/banning-tiktok-and-wechat-another-primer) on Lawfare.  I imagine there will be litigation on this pretty quickly, and the rules will gradually be straightened out.

The order isn't actually a ban on TikTok.  It prohibits ""any transaction by any person .. with ByteDance Ltd.""  That works in practice about the same as a ban, but it's different legally to forbid transactions with ByteDance. The United States pretty commonly forbids transactions with specific foreign actors on national security grounds.

These are powers that the president holds under  [50 USC § 1702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1702).  The president may ""nullify, void, prevent or prohibit any... use... dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege, with respect to transactions involving any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has an interest"" provided that he first declares a national emergency. The president must first have declared a national emergency (which the White House says it did in EO 13873).  After that, he can block any kind of transaction involving a foreign-owned entity (such as ByteDance).  The statute is crazy broad, but it's been used [over and over again](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R45618.pdf) to sanction specific entities.

So, where might Trump run into trouble? First off, Congress can [terminate](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1622) an emergency declaration with a joint resolution (you need both houses, and you need either the president's signature or enough votes to beat a veto).

Second, it's possible that the courts would conclude that the order was pretextual or somehow deficient as a matter of administrative law.   We could end up in a situation where the arguments are similar to [Trump v. Hawaii](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf) or [Department of Commerce v New York](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-966_bq7c.pdf): ByteDance could claim that the president took an action that he was legally permitted to take but did so for legally impermissible reasons.  I think this would be an uphill battle, but Trump's statements the other day could get the ball rolling on a challenge.  I imagine this is where the legal action will be.

Finally, it's possible that the statute granting the president these powers is itself unconstitutional.  Congress has the power under the [commerce clause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause) to ""regulate commerce with foreign nations.""  It's possible that the underlying law (IEEPA) violates the [nondelegation doctrine](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/nondelegation_doctrine) by giving too much of the power to regulate commerce to the executive branch, but the second circuit ruled against this claim in [United States v. Dhafir](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-dhafir).

>  we commissioned a study by the political research firm Pantheon Analytics, using data from Colorado's 2014 election for more than 2.8 million registered voters. The study found that vote at home increased overall turnout by 3.3 percent, and by even more among young and low-propensity voters. 

Especially note ""even more among young...voters"".

There are multiple circumstancial evidence even Republicans presume higher vote turnout favors Democrats. Trump himself said so:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/30/trump-voting-republicans/

> Trump didn’t expand on the thought. But he clearly linked high turnout to Republicans losing elections.

To quote the Atlantic:

> Yet one of the key questions for 2020 is whether Democrats will benefit as much from the likely expansion of the electorate.

> The nature of the population eligible to vote is evolving in a way that should indeed help Democrats. McDonald estimates that the number of eligible voters increases by about 5 million each year, or about 20 million from one presidential election to the next. That increase predominantly flows from two sources: young people who turn 18 and immigrants who become citizens. Since people of color are now approaching a majority of the under-18 population—and also constitute most immigrants—McDonald and other experts believe it’s likely that minorities represent a majority of the people who have become eligible to vote since 2016.

Greg Palast has been accusing the Republicans of supplying broken voting machines to Democrat leaning precints for a very very long time, for eg in https://www.gregpalast.com/recipe-for-a-cooked-election/ but also later in his Armed Madhouse book. As a software developer with 27 years of experience in network security, I must state adding software to this process leads to no good. In ideal circumstances, your input -- for example touching a screen -- leads to a vote added to the central tally and it's the vote you intended. There's absolutely no guarantee this happens and with our current systems and methods it's pretty much impossible to guarantee this. Just as an example, imagine the network card intercepting the transmissions and dropping every tenth vote but it does so only for for 24 hours after receiving a certain signal. Even if you formally verified the voting software -- which never happens -- the machine is _still_ going to commit fraud. You'd need formal verification of every circuit and piece of software (often called firmware) to ensure there are no shenanigans in the machine. But then there's the router the machines are plugged into... and so forth. The number of places where a bad actor can include something nefarious is way too high.

The 12th amendment is the thing which governs the electoral college.  It was written to overcome the fact that the original electoral college was a steaming hot pile of garbage that failed completely upon [first contact with a real election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election)  

The [12th amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxii) remains in important respects a steaming hot pile of garbage.  In particular, it is unclear on key points, and has a backup system prone to massive failure.  Some of the failures are corrected by the [20th amendment,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxx) but it is still a system which has been badly designed since 1787.  

So the basics from the 12th and 20th amendments are this:

* If someone doesn't have 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives would choose the President, and the Senate would choose the Vice President.

* The House would have each state have 1 vote, would vote among the top 3 vote getters, and would require an absolute majority of states to elect the President.

* The Senate would vote for Vice President among the top two electoral vote getters.  It is not clear if the incumbent VP would get to break ties if there were a tie.

* If the House failed to elect a President (either because states are deadlocked or it's split 3 ways or a 25-25 tie) then the VP chosen by the Senate would be President, but only until the House eventually got its act together. 

* If the House failed to elect a President and the Senate failed to elect a Vice President, then per the 20th amendment it would go down the statutory line of succession.  [So the Speaker of the House would become President.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19)  She would remain President only until a President had qualified under the 12th amendment.",huadpe,,i103do,fztw5eu

,"From a geopolitical standpoint, federal support for domestic oil (and energy) companies could make sense in part because fossil fuels are/were critical for the economy. Several countries have nationalized or strictly regulate their energy companies to maintain stability over the sector. The US accounts for 25% of the world's petroleum consumption, while producing only 6% of the world's supply. The 1973 oil embargos demonstrated the vulnerability of the United States to hostile foreign oil supply disruptions. Increasing domestic production of oil and maintaining domestic petroleum reserves were perceived as measures to remedy this. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_the_United_States#Petroleum))

That said, it appears that most tax breaks for oil companies predate OPEC. The [Oil Depletion Allowance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_depletion_allowance) is the most prominent tax benefit approved in 1913 -- the argument is that oil is a finite depletable resource, and oil companies should get tax breaks on their drilling costs to find new oil reserves. This should be understand in the context of the early 20th century, when oil drilling was a risky business that could result in a '[dry hole](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dry-hole.asp)', and during a time period when the US possessed few petroleum reserves (note: Alaska became a state in 1959).

The Oil Depletion Allowance fairly quickly saw opposition in Congress, as many oil companies fairly quickly produced large profitable windfalls.

,"**Can the election be briefly delayed?** 

Yes, but only by Congress.

Congress has the power to set the particular date of elections.  If Congress wished to move election day to e.g. December 1, that would be totally constitutionally sound.  

[Congress has currently chosen the Tuesday after the first Monday in November as election day](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7)

However, **only Congress** may do this.  The President has no power over this.

**Can the election be more than briefly delayed?**

The power to set the dates of elections is limited however by the terms of the offices being elected.  [The 20th amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxx) sets forth that terms for members of Congress end on Jan 3 at noon, and the term for the President ends at Jan 20 at noon.  I do not think any law purporting to move elections for those offices past the date on which the prior offices expire would be found constitutional.  

**What can the President or state officials do if they're willing to push the limits on the law?**

If a state government attempted to delay an election mandated by Congress, there would immediately be a flurry of lawsuits, and likely a [writ of mandamus](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mandamus) ordering the state officials to conduct the election as they are constitutionally required to do.

If that court order were defied... then that's going to be the largest constitutional crisis in US history... inclusive of the civil war.  That is a basic breakdown of constitutional order.

Assuming court orders were not defied, or inexplicably that a court did not order the most basic constitutional duty to continue the democratic system of government in force, and one or more states failed to hold elections...

**A state which failed to hold elections would sacrifice its representation in Congress**

If no elections were timely held in one or more states, those states would sacrifice the benefits of those elections, possibly causing mass chaos in the state government (e.g. not having a functional legislature) as well as not electing anyone to fill Federal offices for that state.  Given that such states would almost certainly be the most deep-red Republican controlled states, it would be a massive self-own by Republican elected officials who would now be former elected officials because there was no election to re-elect them.

Assuming that most officials stick with Trump out of a desire to be re-elected, abandoning the election seems like a bad idea they would not go along with.

**Congress resolves disputes about elections for itself and for President**  

If there were disputes about elections in particular states, it would be for Congress to decide them.  [Article I section 5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#:~:text=Article%20I-,Article%20I,the%20powers%20that%20Congress%20has.) sets that process out for each House of Congress, which is the judge of elections for members of that House, and they jointly certify elections for President.  [This CRS report](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32717.pdf) goes over that process in painstaking detail.

,"The short answer is [no](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-postpone-election.html), the president does not and should not have this power.  This proposal is a fundamental threat to American democracy as is anyone who does anything short of categorically denouncing it.

But the long answer is that ultimately five members of the Supreme Court get to say what the law is.  The Supreme Court has a v*ery* conservative majority, and the only constraint on them is there own sense of duty or shame.

To quickly lay out the law, you have to remember that nothing in the Constitution requires a presidential election in the first place.  The electors choose the president, and the states choose the electors:

>Each state shall appoint, in such a manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state maybe entitled in Congress

A state legislature is free to choose the electors itself as was the [common practice](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25720603.pdf) up to the mid-19th century or use some other method entirely.  It is completely constitutional not to have a (popular) presidential election whatsoever.

Given this, Congress is given a limited power to schedule the selection of **electors,** not the timing of an election.  The constitution provides:

>The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.

Congress exercised that power, which is now codified at [3 U.S. Code § 1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/1):

>The electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, in every fourth year succeeding every election of a President and Vice President

And so you're probably thinking, that's very clear, there's no wiggle room.  But a lot of people said that about [26 USC § 6103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103) (""Upon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives ... the Secretary \[of the Treasury\] shall furnish such committee with any \[tax\] return or return information specified in such request"") and look how that one turned out.  

Attorney General Barr was asked specifically about postponing the election during his testimony in [the House](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/house-judiciary-committee-hearing-of-attorney-general-barr-transcript-july-28):

>Congressman Richmond: Can a sitting president move an election day?  
>  
>Barr: Actually, I haven't looked into that question under the Constitution.  
>  
>Congressman Richmond: Well [2 US Code § 7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7) says federal election day is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November \[note: this is the statute governing Congressional elections\].  So if you take that as a correct statute, is there any executive action by a president -  
>  
>Barr: I've never been asked the question before.  I've never looked into it.

That is not a reassuring answer.  The answer from anyone with Barr's training should be a categorical no.  Everyone should be deeply disturbed by that answer.

So, what might the president claim? I have trouble anticipating the argument, and I hope others are working on this issue, but presumably he would begin with some broad claim of emergency powers.  

One possibility, previously flagged by the [Congressional Research Service](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/RL32471.pdf) (at fn. 16), is that the president could use emergency powers to make it practically impossible to actually carry out an election.  This might force Congress's hand and compel them to pass a law delaying the election or create an otherwise unmanageable situation.

Another possibility would be to rely on the ""take care"" clause, a favorite among conservatives (""he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed"").  It's not hard to imagine a legal argument being advanced that the president's obligation to execute the laws would allow him to postpone an election that he believes will be flagrantly fraudulent in defiance of existing law.

If you don't think some very bright, very conservative lawyers at the Justice Department are presently trying to work out such an argument, then please let me borrow some of whatever you're smoking.  To be clear, any such argument is completely antidemocratic and should fail, but the Supreme Court is a partisan actor like any other, and has [previously intervened](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/) to ensure that its preferred candidate won an election.",chadtr5,,i0pk91,fzrjn33

,"The First Amendment protects people from government restriction on speech. Social media platforms are private companies and can restrict whatever they want.

[Section 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act) does not make companies responsible for user generated content and allows companies to take down content they consider offensive.

The worst that can happen to a company is they lose section 230 protection, which is really bad for that company since they can be  sued and held responsible for user generated content.

As a practical matter, I think companies embrace extreme left wing views and you see people complaining about being banned for saying things like “all lives matter” or “there are only two genders.” This may test the “good faith” requirement on companies in section 230, but I doubt it.

>  
>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

If social media platforms start censoring, or modifying their platforms to favor some groups over others, then have they moved beyond being a provider and into being a publisher?  That has nothing to do with the first amendment.

Here are some things the DOJ has recommended to help clarify.  I bolded the last one for emphasis.  We need to know what exactly the last item means so social media outlets can apply the correct level of administration without violating the town square concept.

,"I think the decision from [PACKINGHAM v. NORTH CAROLINA](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1194_08l1.pdf) was quite telling in how the courts view social media.  The case itself was to strike down a law that prevent convicted sex offenders from access to social media in North Carolina.  The ruling itself has no bearing upon the private businesses.  

However, it does offer insight into why they ruled in the fashion they did and how they view social media.  Some relevant sections:

> A fundamental First Amendment principle is that all persons have access to places where they can speak and listen, and then, after reflection, speak and listen once more. Today, one of the most important places to exchange views is cyberspace, particularly social media, which offers “relatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds,” Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 870, to users engaged in a wide array of protected First Amendment activity on any number of diverse topics.

> With one broad stroke, North Carolina bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge. 

The question, IMO, becomes: if social media has become the modern public square, is the First Amendment's ideas greater than a corporation's ability to moderate their content?  Put another way, currently social media companies can moderate their content against groups of people, but should they be able to?  Are the concepts in the First Amendment so important that we must suspend some degree of corporate liberty to ensure the nature of free speech is protected, even in the private sector?

And this comes with a whole host of questions:

* At what point, quantitatively, are you big enough to be considered part of the ""modern public square""?
* Are/can there be provisions for some degree of universally accepted moderation, such as NSFW, NSFL, underage protected, ect...
* Would allowing a safe space for a topic, such as r/SandersForPresident/, be against the rules, or would allowing other, counter spaces provide sufficient enough balance?

""

Note that section 230 applies to determining an entities relationship to **a particular piece of speech**. A tweet from twitter directly would not be able to use 230 as a shield from liability, but the fact that twitter tweets and sorts content dosen't make twitter the author of every tweet ever or everything that trends. retweets are also protected  


>Can social media and their features that are a result of their user  base's activity(such as twitter trends) be illegal? In twitter's case,  what statutes have they violated?  

Yes but not here. these are likely legal speech, as its very hard to claim slander as a politician and no other laws are alleged to have been violated.  retweeting or causing to trend illegal porn would be illegal. Note that the original posters of the content remain liable for that speech.

> Can the president prevent phrases from trending on any social media that  might be critical of the President or other elected officials? 

No, and its likely any attempt to would fold on first amendment grounds.

>Similarly, what are the tools the administrative branch can use to make  any features of any (legal) social media platforms illegal, or prevent  them from being featured? 

Likely nothing, even those things that aren't protected under 230 have other safe harbor protections for censoring the content (such as DMCA notices and mandatory/non mandatory reporting and self censorship) and even those would likely only alow censorship of the illegal content itself and a fine, not whatever the president desired.

,"Looking at the comments, it seems like people are missing one key part of the argument Fukuyama makes in that article. He is talking very specifically about the weakness of the executive *bureaucracy*, not the presidency. 

Although that article was written back in 2013, he argues right at the end that the *presidential* overreach is paradoxically a likely result of the weak executive *bureaucracy*.

> the temptation in presidential systems to fix problems of legislative gridlock by piling on new executive powers is one that often creates as many problems as it solves. 

Essentially he's arguing that the the people who actually administer state policy (those unelected career bureaucrats who make up the so-called 'deep state') don't have the autonomy to enforce policy in a flexible way. As a result, every little policy disagreement turns into either a campaign issue or a legal challenge. Both of those are zero-sum games, so there is no incentive to compromise, leading to greater polarization, which leads to gridlock. 

It seems contradictory, but to be fair, his whole argument is that there are deep contradictions in the American system (e.g., too much democracy in the day to day administration of policy makes it increasingly difficult to create or change policy democratically). There are plenty of failures that *could* be seems as examples of this, from the incredible foot-dragging on the [9-11 first responders bill](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-lauds-jon-stewart-for-pushing-passage-of-9-11-health-bill/) on one hand to the [politicization of the Supreme Court](https://www.heritage.org/courts/commentary/the-way-stop-politicizing-the-supreme-court) on the other. The one thing that the left and [right](https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/readers-respond/bs-ed-deplorables-letter-20161019-story.html) seem to agree on is that the system is not working. Whether or not you agree with Fukuyama's explanation for why that is the case depends on how much you agree with his starting assumptions. 

That said, Fukuyama has not always been good at telling the difference between a contradiction *in the system he is studying* and a contradiction *in his own logic*. (see, for example, his whole embarrassing [End of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man) theory). Most of the rebuttals to Fukuyama that I know of are in paywalled academic journals, though [this article](https://standpointmag.co.uk/issues/november-2018/overrated-november-2018-francis-fukuyama-daniel-johnson/) offers one quick rebuttal to his work, and [this one](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/09/its-still-not-the-end-of-history-francis-fukuyama/379394/) on the end of history in particular).

Last cycle, the govt didn't have enough support to reduce the number of constituencies that it instructed the commission to draw.  I think it might have been stalled from several cycles ago.

,"Germany has a mixed system:

For the lower house, every adult citizen gets two votes, the First Vote for a local candidate and the Second Vote for a registered party. The First Vote Election is a FPTP system very similar to the US, with the candidate with the most votes in each district getting voted into parliament. The Second Vote however dictates the proportions of parliament. So if a party gets only 5 direct candidates through, but has nationwide 10% of the popular vote they will get an additional 50 or so members of parliament. There are many more details to this (for example only parties reaching a 5%-threshold qualify for Second Vote-Seats), and the system has some issues:

The current German Bundestag is larger than ever. This is because there is a large discrepancy between First Votes (usually divided between the two ""center"" parties) and the Second Vote, which is much more diverse at this point, so the smaller parties get extra members to create proportionality. The courts ordered reform and predictably, parties want to reform the system in ways that would be advantageous to themselves.

This is a kind of implicit admission that the original intent of this law was to disenfranchise voters.

Earlier this year Trump made a similar implicit admission. [In this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/trump-slams-mail-in-voting-says-it-doesnt-work-out-well-for-republicans.html) Trump is quoted as saying:

> They had a level of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you'd never have another Republican elected in this country again.

,"Outside of hard and concrete evidence, such as an official party platform memorandum signed on by federal, state, and municipal GOP leaders which explicitly states ""Our national unified strategy is voter disenfranchisement in the face of our shrinking demographic"", I would propose that what you've found is as close to proof as any of us will be able to locate.  

I think you have begun a good list which clearly demonstrates and, at the very least, lends a lot of credence to the theory that it **is, in fact**, a unified strategy.

Many of your links are well sourced and provide additional links and background events that support this theory.  From the Guardian link:

>In Texas, meanwhile, acting secretary of state David Whitley announced in January 2019 that he had a list of 95,000 non-citizens (immigrants) who were registered to vote in the state. Worse yet, he claimed, 58,000 of them had already cast a ballot in an election. He quickly turned over the names of these apparent miscreants to Texas’ attorney general to pursue criminal prosecution.  
>  
>Whitley’s claim was, in the end, a lie. The list, [as Whitley well knew](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/02/14/david-whitley-delivered-texas-lawmakers-apology-forcitizenship-review/), was structurally flawed and [contained tens of thousands of naturalized citizens](https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2019-05-27/voter-purge-leader-david-whitley-resigns/) who had the right to vote. Texas, in short, was getting ready to remove American citizens from the voting rolls simply because they had once been immigrants.

and

>Another tactic, which Tennessee tried after 2018, is to criminalize voter registration drives. Initially, it would seem that a state [ranked at the very bottom](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/08/tennessee-voter-registration-law-low-turnout-suppression/1116787001/) in the nation in voter turnout and close to the bottom in those registered to vote would try to improve their citizens’ participation in democracy. Instead, as the New York Times reported, when “[tens of thousands of new black and Latino voters](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/tennessee-voter-registration.html) were registered in Tennessee in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections” the Republican-dominated legislature complained that many of the registration forms were incomplete and that the only viable solution was to hold those who held these voter registration drives criminally and financially accountable. Although a judge has struck down the law, the threat of what Tennessee Republicans are willing to do hangs there.

There is also the widespread push, headed by Trump, Barr, and others at the top to paint Vote by Mail as ""opening the floodgates for voter fraud"".

From the RS Article:

>Trump and his Republican enablers are putting voter suppression front and center — fear-mongering about voting by mail, escalating their Election Day poll watching and so-called ballot-security operations, and blocking funding to prepare the country for a pandemic-era election. “The president views vote-by-mail as a threat to his election,” a lawyer for the Trump campaign recently told *60 Minutes*. Attorney General William Barr told Fox News that vote-by-mail “absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud.” And Trump blasted out in a May tweet that “MAIL-IN VOTING WILL LEAD TO MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE. IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS TRAGEDY BEFALL OUR NATION.”

&#x200B;

I could continue on and on, but I think any reasonable person would find it hard **not** to believe this is a unified national GOP Strategy based on the heavily skewed preponderance of voter suppression tactics employed in GOP led areas, as well as by our GOP led Federal government.

One thing I have noticed lately, and this will be purely a subjective claim, is that the GOP has adopted a tactic that has worked surprisingly well by Trump in recent years.  They ""yell the quiet part out loud"".  There is a certain psychological effect that happens when a person of authority says something so incredulous, yet with an air of absolute confidence and authority, that a normal citizen's mind just simply can't truly grasp how extreme it is.

It's as if there is a trigger in our brain that fires off when it is presented with something so ridiculous said by people we generally hold to be well-educated and wholly accountable for their actions, that we lose our grasp of just how extreme those views may be in a reality as it existed just moments ago.  We simply don't have the appropriate reaction as we would have in previous years where this wasn't so ""normal"".

They have an especially well propagated page on Voter Fraud.  They investigated and confirmed over 1200 cases of voter fraud in the last 6 years.  What is curiously absent from any portion of their study, their website, or any press releases on the matter is which party was ultimately benefiting from each case of fraud.  While I cannot say this is proof of anything, I think we all know off-hand how many media reports we get about voter fraud and which party seems to always be involved.

In fairness to the above article, in some of those places it can be deceiving to only look at poll closures, as it sometimes, though not that often, comes with the opening of voting centers. To be fair to that though, voting centers aren’t all that great and still result in long lines for urban voters and short times for rural ones. 

Honestly, we don’t talk enough about how Indiana has gone into overdrive to disenfranchise their minority [citizens](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/08/10/silencing-vote-data-shows-unequal-barrier-indiana-polls/435450001/).

If you don’t have time to read, after Obama took Indiana in 2008 the state made adding absentee ballot drop off sites impossible to add for large counties. Any county over a certain amount in population is allowed only 1 drop off location unless their board unanimously approves more. This limit just so happens to only apply to one county and that county’s Republican members of the board of elections always so happen to be the ones voting against such things. By comparison, neighboring rural counties seem to expand early voting at a breakneck pace.

The Atlantic [recently described](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/right-way-activate-national-guard/608524/) the different ways the National Guard can be activated very well. Essentially, there's three options:

1. State active duty: the governor retains control, the state government foots the bill.

2. Title 32: the governor retains control, the federal government foots the bill.

3. Title 10: the President (via the DoD) assumes control, the federal government foots the bill.

Title 32 has some limitations. Essentially, National Guard troops can only be used for humanitarian and logistical aid, while Title 10 is used to provide military support.

Those wanting to take advantage of the crowd to incite violence and destruction will see them as just anther aggressor.  The media will spin the story to increase their ratings and drag this whole thing out longer.

The NG usually has less training on crowd control and de-escalation than police. Their presence as a standalone force is a powder keg waiting to blow.  Using them to supplement the police ranks or support the police in logistical and administrative manner is a much safer way to use them.

,"It's an additional incentive to keep people on payroll while simultaneously increasing take-home pay.

Payroll tax is in addition to income tax. It goes to directly fund Social Security and Medicare. The current rate is 15.3%.

Employees are only responsible for half and employers are on the hook for the other.

So a payroll tax holiday would directly reduces the cost to maintain an employee.


Downsides is a sudden reduction in funding to Medicare and Social Security. So any long term tax cut, would need to source alternate revenue to keep these programs afloat.

,"There's no bar on state authorities arresting someone who happens to be a federal agent for a violation of the law, but federal agents do have immunity from state law for their *official* actions.

On the criminal side, the relevant precedent is [In re Neagle](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep135/usrep135001/usrep135001.pdf).  As others have said, this flows from the supremacy clause.  The most recent significant case addressing this issue was [Idaho v. Horiuchi](https://casetext.com/case/idaho-v-horiuchi-2) concerning the Ruby Ridge incident.   As the court held there, the Supreme Court views the supremacy clause as ""prohibiting any action by the states that would interfere with the operation of the federal government,"" thus criminal prosecution of federal officers for performing their duties is generally foreclosed.  The court held in Horiuchi:

>Federal agents will be immune from state prosecution if they acted in an objectively reasonable manner in carrying out their duties.

That probably sounds like a big loophole to you (if you can show agents acting unreasonably), but it isn't.  There's a long and separate answer as to why, but this standard comes very close to meaning that federal agents have complete immunity.  There has been very little jurisprudence on the specific issue of *criminal* liability, but the court's precedents on *civil* liability show pretty clearly how it would turn out.

Turning to civil liability, the Westfall Act (the Federal Employees Lability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988) gives *absolute* civil immunity from state law to federal officers for negligent or wrongful acts performed within the scope of employment.  See [28 U.S. Code § 2679(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2679):

>(1) Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a United States district court shall be deemed an action against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant.  
>  
>(2) Upon certification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose, any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending. Such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the United States under the provisions of this title and all references thereto, and the United States shall be substituted as the party defendant. This certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.

In plain English, if a federal officer commits some wrongful act in the scope of your employment, you might be able to sue the federal government (subject to various other limitations) but you generally can't sue the officer (see also [here](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2010/12/06/usab5806.pdf)).

You might be able to sue a federal officer in federal court pursuant to federal law in what's known as a [Bivens](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep403/usrep403388/usrep403388.pdf) action.  You then run into the doctrine of [qualified immunity](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity).  In brief, you can sue a federal officer in federal court if their actions violated your ""clearly established"" rights.  Federal courts have taken a rather limited view of what counts as a clearly established right, though.  This is best indicated by describing some cases that were dismissed under qualified immunity for not violating a ""clearly established"" right:

* Fresno police officers stole $225,000 while executing a search warrant.  The [Ninth Circuit](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/09/04/17-16756.pdf) held that ""the alleged theft... was morally wrong"" but the officers ""did not have clear notice that it violated the fourth amendment,"" so the case was dismissed on the grounds that stealing money does not violate a clearly established right.
* Police officers Spencer Harris and Brad Bracey sicced an attack dog on Alexander Baxter while he had his hands up and was surrendering.  Baxter was bitten on the arm and injured.  The [Sixth Circuit](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca6/18-5102/18-5102-2018-11-08.html) held that there is not a ""clearly established"" constitutional right not to be attacked by police dogs while surrendering to police and dismissed the case.
* Johnny Leija checked into the hospital suffering from severe pneumonia.  After treatment, Leija became ""confused and anxious"" and began acting erratically.  Hospital personnel summoned the police to help calm Leija down and ensure his safety.  The officers shot Leija twice with a taser and wrestled him to the ground, killing him.  The tenth circuit held that killing Leija *had* violated his ""clearly established"" constitutional rights, but the Supreme Court overturned this ruling, and the officers were eventually [given qualified immunity](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-immunity-scotus/).

Long story short, it's basically impossible to even sue a federal officer for stealing from you, attacking you, or even murdering you.  Thus, as noted above, it's very unlikely that the Supreme Court would allow a state to impose criminal liability on a federal officer for similar conduct.

There are some avenues that a state could use to attempt to curtail abuses by federal law enforcement:

* Withhold any and all forms of cooperation with federal law enforcement.
* Provide legal assistance to individuals detained or charged by federal law enforcement.
* Engage in otherwise legal actions that have the effect of impeding federal law enforcement.  You could get creative here: rolling power blackouts? Decide it's a good day to close down and repave the street in front of federal buildings?

However, the federal property trespass crimes appear to be happening after the peaceful protestors retire for the night, bedtime, gotta go to work in the morning and all.

After midnight, the federal properties are approached by people interested in applying paint to federal buildings, a crime of both vandalism and the crime of trespass when asked by federal officers to move off of the property.

Remember that Navy fellow who earned a few baton taps the other day, since there was no audio and no complete reporting of what happened, we do not know if a federal officer had asked him to leave the federal property.  I would guess he was asked to leave, but that is a guess only based on what one would expect a federal officer to do when approached by a trespasser.  But benefit of the doubt, the federal officer might have enticed the trespasser to move closer so the officer could baton him.  We may never know.

,"The Libertarian party platform is based around laissez-faire free market purism. This specifically means, as much as possible, eliminating taxes, cutting regulations (enforced via civil and criminal penalty), and in general arguing for government removal for everything economic except for fraud and coercion protection, in addition to eliminating minimum wage according to their [site](https://www.lp.org/about/).

Their replacement for a minimum wage is free negotiation of labor prices between corporations and workers. There are a few problems with this. The main problem is that this is not an equitable negotiation; if you have no money, you starve to death. If a corporation has no money, it folds with limited liability. Moreover, they are larger bargainers and thus have more negotiating power individually. There are many more workers than there are corporations. [We don't have the greatest history of an uncontrolled labor market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_history_of_the_United_States) going well. The problem with ""letting the free market sort it out,"" as they are wont to do, is a problem called [the tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). Essentially, there are significant social benefits and costs that are not accounted for without central regulation like that of a government.

Suppose you are a worker and I am a corporation. It is in my interest to pay you for work, and in your interest to work for pay. However, if I can get away with just paying you enough to survive as long as the term of work, just healthy enough to work, and give you working conditions with very little investment and as much workload as possible, then I shall do so. If I do not do so, a competitor who is willing to do so will simply out-compete me and then they shall be the dominant hiring source. You may want to have enough to live, have a comfortable life, get an education to move to better positions, own a house, provide for a family without having your children having to work, be able to afford treatment for disease, etc, but I simply do not care and don't have to pay you--it's altogether too easy to replace you with a worker who is wiling to accept my terms. If I can't hire on terms, well, then I'll just close down that arm of my business. On the other hand, on your side, you may only have a small handful of employers hiring in your area to choose from, and you *must* choose someone, because survival is not optional. This is the reality of uncontrolled labor negotiations, and the reason why we have labor standards laws and unions today.

If there are labor standards laws, then I as a company can feel comfortable following them, because my competitors must also follow them and cannot be more competitive without having the law crash down on them. Universal laws and restrictions aren't bad for companies in any way; in fact, many employers would agree they are beneficial as they set a universal baseline which everyone must follow, and avoid a prisoner's dilemma of treating workers ethically vs staying in business. Unions are also great, especially when they span multiple employers, because they provide a basis for collective negotiation and ensure social benefit and market efficiency.

The question is then, what social benefits does ensuring higher wages provide that outweighs the cost of reduced employment?

Firstly, [minimum wage as is, is not livable](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/save-money/renting-on-minimum-wage/). A higher minimum wage would ensure that employed workers are able to escape poverty more effectively and ensure their own standard of living. Even the libertarians agree that minimum wage positions are not viable as long-term employment for escaping poverty; the mechanism of argument for abolishing minimum wage is that this allows corporations to invest in more low-income positions at sub-minimum cost. Of course, these positions would be even *less* effective as long-term employment to escape poverty since they pay less.

The libertarian answer is viewing minimum wage positions as merely stepping stones. They argue that abolishing minimum wage allows more people on the lowest-income side of the ladder so that more can climb. However, it is extremely questionable as to the merit of the argument, since the vast majority of low-income positions rarely offer inherent experience that allows upward mobility. As an example, a typical McDonalds minimum wage worker has very little on the job experience that allows them to become anything but a small increase to manager positions. There is no path to jump to skilled labor in appreciable time, like if they aspire to be a bio-statistician. If we examine [labor statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2017/home.htm), we can also plainly see that there are many who spend decades in minimum wage positions, and the population of the minimum wage worker is far older than we would expect if we truly expected that these positions were perfect stepping stones. 

A higher minimum wage allows for more self-investment. Self-investment, like higher education, [is a much stronger determining factor of being able to rise above federal minimum wage](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2017/home.htm). Self-investment also includes expenditures like health, property, and family, as well as factors which inherently increase the size employment markets like a larger proportion of workers being able to afford a car. Businesses may be paying more for their lowest wages, but they also reap significant social benefits in terms of having a more educated populace to pay for, and being able to hire workers from a wider average range. There's a reason that common proponents of raising minimum wage, like Bernie Sanders' campaign, are also [interested in controlling the costs of college](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/).

,"TLDR; Supply siders have had it their way for far too long and the quality of life results haven't been that great. We need demand siders to bring balance to the force...

I argue against abolishing the federal minimum wage.

This is basically an argument about supply and demand economics. Almost everyone knows about supply side because that’s be the go to for America for the last several decades, however [demand side economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-side_economics) is very much a thing that should be discussed more. Increasing minimum wage relative to inflation would be a goal of demand side advocates because it will spread money out into more consumers hands to create more disposable income and thereby increase demand for goods and services by increasing the [velocity of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money).

Imagine you live in a town with an amazon or Walmart distribution center or similar large business. If you are a small business owner it is pretty safe to assume that your average patron is much more likely to be a lower wage worker than Jeff Bezos or another wealthy shareholder. If the minimum wage is increased those workers wages will likely increase progressively. Even workers that earn above minimum wage will be able to justify raise increases. The higher up in the payscale you are, the less likely it will affect you. Shareholders would take the direct hit...unless prices are increased. This is normally used as the argument against minimum wage because “it will raise prices” but conveniently leaves out that workers are also consumers and they now have more disposable income to spend on goods and services. Prices will increase some but not proportionate to the wage increase since cost of labor is only one factor in determining [cost of goods sold.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_goods_sold) the local business owner will see increased demand and will be able to raise prices to cover the wage increase. If their business is popular then demand will likely increase enough that they actually sees significantly higher profits despite having to pay the employees more.

Anyone arguing that eliminating the minimum wage should also consider that we haven’t raised it in over a decade...therefore we have effectively been lowering the minimum wage due to inflation since 2009. If you believe that lower minimum wage is better then we should be seeing proof of this playing out positively. However by most metrics it appears quality of life in America is declining. [home prices increased ](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS), [healthcare costs increased](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical), [food prices increased](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/food-inflation-in-the-united-states/), [education costs increased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_tuition_in_the_United_States) all while [income inequality is rising](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/a-guide-to-statistics-on-historical-trends-in-income-inequality) and [health is declining.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/29/suicide-overdose-life-expectancy-1025922)

Another favored argument of those who are for abolishing minimum wage is that there are [several nations with no minimum wage law](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080515/5-developed-countries-without-minimum-wages.asp) that offer very high standards of living. However these countries have much higher amounts of govt regulation and unions than the United States. These are certainly not libertarian free market utopias. You are simply trading one form of government intervention for another. Let’s not pretend wages in these countries are cheap either, they are among [the highest in the world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage)

At the end of the day as I stated at the beginning this is basically an argument of supply vs demand economics. The Nordic countries show that a minimum wage is not necessary to have a high standard of living, however it appears that government intervention certainly is. So if your argument is that minimum wage is bad because it is government intervention into a free market then I urge you to reconsider. Especially considering the us has neither heavy labor regulations or [high minimum wages.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/minimum-wage-by-country)

I’m not saying that demand side economics is “The One True Model” that we should live our lives by...I’m simply trying to show that we have been pushing the supply side for far too long and now need to focus on the demand side to help balance the economy. Fair, inflation adjusted minimum wages are one way to do that.

edit: I forgot to offer direct counter arguments to the original OP's sources arguing that minimum wages hurt employment opportunities. There is zero overlap between the [nations with highest minimum wages](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/minimum-wage-by-country) and [countries with highest unemployment rates](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/unemployment-by-country). In fact, those countries are in the lower deciles of unemployment rankings. Seattle's minimum wage increase was used as an example. Minimum wage job hours decreased as wages increased. The source doesn't state how much of this is due to workers moving into higher wage positions. I believe most people would prefer to make the same or more money while being able to work fewer hours. Also, personally and morally i believe any job worth doing is worth being paid a living wage. Using age, minority, or dependency status is a poor excuse for someone getting less pay. They are still consumers that support other businesses. Young people living home would be able to save more money and leave the house sooner and start their own lives if they were paid a higher minimum wage. I also believe that any job that can be automated effectively SHOULD be. Our goal should be less time working jobs that don't need to be done by people and more time spent on creative pursuits.",8yr0n,,humtmu,fyoias8
,"Arguments against minimum wage *might* make sense if the US labor market were purely competitive and symmetric. In that case, workers could easily withhold their labor to obtain a wage that reflected their true contribution/output. 

However, in reality, certain parts of our economy are dominated by relatively few employers that have comparatively more power than labor (monopsony), as a result of weakened policies that once granted workers more power to bargain for pay and benefits. The erosion of labor’s power enables companies to hire workers at lower wages than these workers might otherwise accept in a more competitive market, thus making a min wage necessary to at least provide some reasonable floor. 

For example, the decline of unions, precipitated by policy changes as well as a shift in our economy toward traditionally non-union jobs, has played a role in shifting more power to corporations, contributing to the asymmetry that can suppress wages. 

Again, the argument for keeping a minimum or living wage: workers simply do not have the power to get a reasonable wage from corporations that have increased their power.

,"[The best argument is that incomes and costs of living vary drastically by location](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/cost-of-living-index-by-state), so any level that would be reasonable for rich and expensive states would cause mass unemployment in poor and low cost states. There's no level that works for both.

Now federal government could vary it by state / city, and any other criteria it wishes to have (and it does so for Puerto Rico, otherwise it would cause mass unemployment and even more economic devastation than it already faces). But at this point, why even involve federal government at all, if states / cities can handle setting the rate?

Or federal level government could set minimum wage that works for poorer states, and rely on richer states to set their own higher minimum wages. It's a weirdly complicated system, and pretty much what's going on now. But really, why even involve federal government in this?

The article does not pertain to minority workers, at all.  It states that ""All this evidence points to the fact that a minimum wage job is a starting point, not a permanent trap. Young, inexperienced workers take on such jobs to learn valuable, real-world skills that they then use to get promoted and receive a higher salary.""  Also, "" **About half** of all minimum wage workers are under the age of 25, and about a quarter of them are between 16 and 19 years old. **64 percent of minimum wage workers** are employed part-time, implying that they are teenagers taking up a summer job, full-time students trying to earn some money outside of class, and adults who earn another type of income as well.""  I mean, this article completely ignores completely half of the people over 25 who work minimum wage jobs, and the plight of the 36% of minimum wage workers who are not employed part-time.  **This is the minority here, and the entire article is silent on their circumstance.**  It's fair to assume from the article that this minority is over 25 years old and employed full-time in a minimum wage position, and for this minority, it is indeed a permanent trap.  The article states that ""Nobody is actually supposed to live on the wage such a job would provide"", well, except for the significant minority of people whose situation the article completely disregards as unimportant.

,"If individual cities could just refuse to allow federal law enforcement to operate in them, then the whole concept of sanctuary cities would be different. As it stands, a sanctuary city is one whose Government doesn't officially cooperate with ICE, but this doesn't prevent ICE from attempting to enforce immigration law in those cities, it just makes it more difficult for them. Some cities [cancel contracts with ICE detention facitilies](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/cities-saying-no-ice-canceling-contracts-agency/tnamp/), but that doesn't prevent ICE from enforcing federal law. There is nothing that a city or state can do to prevent federal law enforcement from enforcing federal law within it's territory, short of succession. Cancelling contracts with detention facilities just forces ICE to seek a detention facility that's farther away from the city (or even out of state), which makes it harder for the families of detained aliens to visit them or support them through their legal proceedings.

Ostensibly, one of the reasons that federal law enforcement are being sent to these cities is for the protection of federal property.

So this doesn’t really depend on the limitations of federal law enforcement power under the constitution.

Edit to add: this is authorized by the [US Constitution Article IV, Section 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv) and is known as the federal enclave doctrine.

To add some more, the US government only has general police power in 5 situations:

1. United States territory, which includes places like courthouses and office buildings. But also unincorporated territories like Guam and the US Virgin Islands. 
2. In DC
3. In the armed services

Yes, IF nothing is done to remedy the inequality that will occur and we stay out of the classroom too long.  I really am beginning to lean toward a solution that closes all school until January (no education at all) and resets the national school year to a year round calendar with multiple 2-3 week breaks through the year, instead of one long summer.  I think this will help struggling families and prevent further inequality.  But under my idea we would need to open in January no matter what on Corona, if we can't control it in 4 more month, then we need to abandon the idea that we can.

I get that in many areas teachers are scared but they are essential workers and they will have to go back long before they are comfortable doing so (but hopefully not in the middle of huge peaks).  Online learning is simply not very accessible to everyone - money is part of it, but infrastructure in rural areas is a big part too.

In both cases, though, the governments have been emphasizing concerns over the extradition of HK citizens living in those countries. It would be a huge leap for the PRC to demand the extradition of a non-national (e.g. a Canadian) for a 'crime' committed outside of PRC jurisdiction (e.g. in Canada) - basically extending Chinese jurisdiction to the entire world. To the contrary, last year New Zealand [ruled against](https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/new-zealand-court-orders-minister-of-justice-to-reconsider-extradition-request-from-china/) extraditing a Korean (ROK) citizen to the PRC for a murder committed in the PRC, even though there was a extradition treaty in place. The rationale was, basically, that there was reasonable concern that the accused would be subject to torture and/or unfair trail. With that precedent, it seems even less likely that a court in New Zealand at least would extradite one of its own citizens.

That said, the law does seem to allow the PRC to charge people anywhere in the world with crimes of subversion. This is a problem if those people ever want to visit (or just transit through) Hong Kong, who could then be arrested. Australia has issued a [travel warning](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/asia/hong-kong) over this possibility: 

>""Under the law, you could be deported or face possible transfer to mainland China for prosecution under mainland law. The full extent of the law and how it will be applied is not yet clear. You may be at increased risk of detention on vaguely defined national security grounds.""

(also see this [article](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/09/china-hong-kong-national-security-law-free-speech/) in Foreign Policy. It's paywalled, but the free preview gives a good gist of the concerns). 

Of course you could point to the Meng Wanshou case as an example of how the US, via Canada, is already playing that game.

&#x200B;

Taiwan is a peculiar case, because the PRC still considers all Taiwanese as PRC citizens. So, as I understand it, Article 38 would technically apply to Taiwanese the same way it would to *other non-HK citizens of the PRC*. The PRC generally doesn't prosecute Taiwanese citizens for political dissent expressed outside of the PRC itself, though it will make a lot of noise and use other forms of pressure (e.g. cutting funding or cancelling visas). It is hard to say how much that will change now, but that is a question of political power, not of legality. 

The current DPP government in Taiwan is absolutely not going to cooperate with any PRC requests for extradition. In fact they are setting up [offices](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/03/taiwan-slams-hong-kong-national-security-law-opens-office-to-help.html) and programs to make it easier for Hong Kongers to seek refuge in Taiwan. This [article](https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/what-can-taiwan-do-to-help-defend-hong-kong/) is also a good example of the kind of suggestions circulating in Taiwanese intellectual circles of what Taiwan should be doing in this regard.

The main danger that I can think of here is that the PRC has previously used its influence to have Taiwanese citizens living abroad extradited [back](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/asia/taiwan-extradition-beijing-intl/index.html) to the mainland instead of to Taiwan. So Taiwanese citizens (and Hong Kongers who seek asylum in Taiwan) could be in serious trouble if they're every in a position where they need to be repatriated.

Another factor is that in all cases of private currency, there is an established exchange rate and people always have the option of using legal tender instead of the private currency.

,"The first thing to realize here is that the US has more than two parties. It actually has [over 50 registered political parties,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States) about 15 of which have a national presence. Thirteen political parties got votes for President in the 2016 election.

We always talk about the ""two party system,"" but it's not so much designed to be that way as it is a [consequence of our electoral system](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/os-government2e/chapter/the-two-party-system/) that voters tend to favor candidates from two dominant parties by a wide margin. (It wasn't always these two parties.)

Not all the parties field Presidential candidates each year, but in 2016, there were at least [four candidates](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2016.pdf) on the ballot in enough states to have a mathematical possibility of winning the electoral college and thereby becoming President. We all acknowledge that the candidates from the lesser known parties didn't have much of a chance, but Jill Stein of the Green Party got 1.07% of the popular vote and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian party garnered 3.28%. Both those parties are [fielding Presidential candidates in 2020](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_candidates,_2020) as well, and voting for them could certainly send a message that you don't like the choices from either of the better known parties.

Another important concept is that [nobody is required to vote in any/every race for their ballot to count.](https://www.findlaw.com/voting/my-voting-guide/can-i-leave-blanks-on-a-voting-ballot.html) Leaving a race blank is often viewed as a ""protest vote,"" especially when voters cast votes in most or all of the other races. In 2016, [over 1.7 million voters left their choice blank in the Presidential race.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200630111958/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/14/1-7-million-people-in-33-states-and-dc-cast-a-ballot-without-voting-in-the-presidential-race/)

Ballots in the State of Nevada have a specific [""None of These Candidates"" option,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_These_Candidates) by which voters can express their displeasure with the choices in a particular race. In 2016, that option in the Presidential race got 2.56% of the vote, which was not only the most in its history, but also greater than the margin of victory in the State.

And for those people who only care about the Presidential race but don't like any of the candidates, yes, they can stay home. But taken in historical context, 2016 was not a great example of that, because [voter turnout was actually relatively high compared to general elections over the last 30 years.](http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present)

So, there are plenty of ways for voters to express their displeasure with the two most popular parties and to make other choices. Those parties do pay attention to this stuff, but [only tend to shift when enough people start defecting.](https://www.history.com/news/third-party-candidates-election-influence-facts)

I’ll add that [72% of Republicans doubt whether Obama was born in America](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-persistent-partisan-divide-over-birther-question-n627446), [54% believed he’s a secret Muslim](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8108005/obama-muslim-poll), [51% believed in 2015 that there we found WMD's in Iraq](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/poll-republicans-wmds-iraq-114016), etc.

He just has a speech impediment, [that’s been well-documented since he was a kid](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-09-15/joe-bidens-childhood-struggle-with-a-stutter). What’s happening is that people already predisposed to disliking someone will believe negative things about that person more easily than in previous eras (hence why more than [46% of Republicans in 2016 either believed or weren't sure whether Hillary was running a prostitution ring out of a pizza place](https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/polls/trump-remains-unpopular-voters-prefer-obama-on-scotus-pick/), and why most Democrats think Trump is dumb despite him beating 20+ other people to become President in a country of 330 million people, and while I don’t agree with his politics at all, I’m not going to call him dumb). 

So that’s my thoughts on why the unfavorables are high. And I’ll add that political science research has found that voters care more about a candidate’s sex life rather than whether they support democratic institutions (on both sides). So if you are having a difficult time choosing between the two candidates, just look at their respective platforms, and vote based off of that rather than how each side is choosing to smear the other (access Hollywood tape, Tara Reade, clips from the apprentice, etc.).

,"This is not an answer you're going to like because it runs against the prevailing ideology, but when political scientists study this sort of thing (satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the political system or with the candidates on offer) the general proxy is voter turnout.

When voter turnout is low, that's used as a proxy that signals that the populace is disengaged from the system, or that the candidates were particularly poor this time around.

So to reject both candidates simply don't vote. This also explains why establishment ideology so heavily pushes just going out to vote, because voting is taken as a sign of consent with the overall system. If you vote, you are handing over your voice in effect to the elites. So it's the exact opposite of the common ideological phrase that if you don't vote you don't get to have an opinion.

Key references here are the literature on the crisis of legitimacy in contemporary liberal democracies. Virtually all of this literature starts by pointing to the declining rate of voter turnout since the 1960s as evidence of disengagement and disinterest with the candidates on offer. Key names are Pippa Norris, Colin Hay and the literature on democratic deficits and voter dissatisfaction with elite-driven politics.

,"The strongest argument against is laid out in the [Constitution itself](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-10/):  Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution, provides that “[n]o State shall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State.""

[_Virginia v. Tennessee_](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/148/503/) clarified this a bit, stating that Congressional consent is required only for a compact if it is “directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States.”

So, a strong case could be made that the NPVIC does in fact cause an  'increase  of political power in the States' in question and 'encroach upon ... the just supremacy of the United States' by effectively removing the powers granted to each State in the Electoral College through effectively nullifying their electoral voice.  If so, this means that the NPVIC would require Congressional approval to enact, which it is unlikely to acquire at present; _if_ Congress were to agree it might withstand judicial challenge, but that is probably not going to happen.

Now, whether or not this particular compact satisfies the test in _Virginia v. Tennessee_ is something that will almost certainly require a SCOTUS decision, and how that will play out is anyone's guess.",Ansuz07,,hm8y8l,fx4w4ko
,"The strongest argument for its constitutionality was just made by Elena Kagan in her opinion for a unanimous court.

[Section 3](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-465_i425.pdf) reads ""The Electors’ constitutional claim has neither text nor history on its side. Article II and the Twelfth Amendment give States broad power over electors, and give electors themselves no rights. Early in our history, States decided to tie electors to the presidential choices of others, whether legislatures or citizens. Except that legislatures no longer play a role, that practice has continued for more than 200 years. Among the devices States have long used to achieve their object are pledge laws, designed to impress on electors their role as agents of others. A State follows in the same tradition if, like Washington, it chooses to sanction an elector for breaching his promise. Then too, the State instructs its electors that they have no ground for reversing the vote of millions of its citizens. That direction accords with the Constitution—as well as with the trust of a Nation that here, We the People rule.""

What that says to me is that a state can compel its electors to do whatever it wants, and if it wants to compel its electors to vote for the national popular vote winner, then it can. I think a lot of people get tripped up on the word 'compact' in the name of National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and think that since a compact between states is pretty explicitly banned in the constitution then this must be unconstitutional. In reality, this isn't really a compact or agreement and is named pretty poorly. Each individual state is passing legislation to compel its electors to vote for the national popular vote winner once enough states pass national popular vote legislation so as to accomplish a 270 vote electoral majority. Those states aren't making agreements with each other. They aren't shaking hands or signing a contract, they're individually passing similar legislation.",p-s-chili,,hm8y8l,fx5b8wk

Simple majorities always lead to tyranny of the majority and that's what our government is set up to balance out. I find it ironic that the party who claims to represent the oppressed now wants to dismantle the system that allowed it to make progress.

,"It is a very complex situation, and it is one that it is difficult have to summarise, but here is a little summary, and believe me, there are many more things to add.

Let's start in 2012, when Chavez, the president at the time, died, leaving Maduro, his vice-president, in command of the country.

This meant that there were elections in 2013 to elect the next president, the main candidates were Capriles and Maduro. The Venezuelan society was very polarised, as recorded by the [Carter Center Pre-Election report](https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-pre-election-rpt-2013.pdf).

[The result was a razor-thin](https://apnews.com/eee885e6ba6949cd8a38cef99b607f1d) victory for Maduro, so Maduro would become the president of Venezuela from 2013 to 2019.

Then, in 2014 there were huge protests against violence, inflation, and shortages - led by Capriles.

In 2015, there were parliamentary elections, where Maduro's party had dominated for the past 18 years or so; but this time [the opposition parties came together and got 2/3 of the national assembly](https://web.archive.org/web/20151210224739/http://www.elpitazo.com/ultimas-noticias/oposicion-saco-2-108-397-votos-mas-que-el-chavismo/), a landslide victory by all accounts.

The electoral commission closed the election and everything appeared to have gone without major incidents... Boy we were wrong.

The outgoing parliamentarians (2009-2015 and pro-Maduro), quickly d[ecided to appoint new judges to the supreme court,](https://comunicacioncontinua.com/fcjp-ucv-designacion-precipitada-de-magistrados-del-tsj-en-contra-de-la-soberania-popular/) on a process heavily criticised because[it did not follow the procedure laid out on the constitution.](https://versionfinal.com.ve/politica-dinero/federacion-nacional-de-abogados-emite-nota-de-protesta-ante-sentencias-del-tsj-pronunciamiento/)

Two days later, [the new judges claimed that there were irregularities in the election of three opposition candidates](https://elpitazo.com/tag/impugnan-resultados-en-amazonas/), and stripped them of their victory. This would put the opposition share below the 2/3, this is relevant because 2/3 is the amount of votes that are needed to pass certain laws.

During the swear-in ceremony for the parliament, [the opposition decided to swear-in the three parliamentarians.](https://www.dw.com/en/venezuela-opposition-swears-in-three-banned-lawmakers/a-18964405)

So, [the Supreme Court decided to declare the parliament ""in contempt](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35287291)"", and to declare all its decision as ""null"", until they remove the three opposition parliamentarians.

This led to a stand-off, [until 2017 when the parliament decided to remove the parliamentarians](https://red.diariocritico.com/noticia/1516794/venezuela/an-termino-con-desacato-y-desincorporo-oficialmente-a-diputados-de-amazonas.html)... But the [judges still claimed that the parliament is ""in contempt"",](https://htr.noticierodigital.com/2017/01/tsj-insiste-en-que-la-an-se-encuentra-en-desacato-pese-a-desincorporacion-de-diputados-de-amazonas/) and all their decisions are null.

So, in 2017 [Maduro called a Constituent National Assembly](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39775092) (ANC), which is a body to re-write the constitution, [and picks all the candidates, which includes his wife, and the president of his party.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41094889)

The election is carried out, [every single democratic country under the sun denounces it](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/02/venezuela-voting-fraud-corruption-allegations-protests), the [Venezuelan company that provided the electoral machines said they were tampered.](https://www.smartmatic.com/media/article/smartmatic-statement-on-the-recent-constituent-assembly-election-in-venezuela/) But all this is ignored.

Shortly after, the ANC [says they are going to take over the powers of the parliament](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-40981405).

Then, there were mayoral elections in December 2017, which [the opposition decided to boycott in sign of protest](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-opposition/major-venezuelan-opposition-parties-to-boycott-local-polls-idUSKBN1CZ2L4), so[on election night Maduro said that he was going to ban all the opposition parties](https://www.ft.com/content/d630193c-d9d1-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482) from participating in the upcoming presidential elections, shortly after he [unregistered them from the lists of parties](https://web.archive.org/web/20180425040527/http://efectococuyo.com/politica/las-10-irregularidades-de-los-comicios-del-20mayo/).

[The opposition parties had been successfully registered for the presidential election since earlier 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20180425040527/http://efectococuyo.com/politica/las-10-irregularidades-de-los-comicios-del-20mayo/), and the biggest opposition parties had chosen their candidates\[[Capriles](https://www.efe.com/efe/america/politica/capriles-aspirara-por-tercera-vez-a-la-presidencia-de-venezuela-segun-su-partido/20000035-3213226)\]\[[Allup](https://efectococuyo.com/politica/ramos-allup-ratifico-su-postulacion-como-candidato-presidencial/)\].

Capriles, the 2012 candidate who got 49%, [tried to register the block of parties for the 2018 election, but he is denied](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20180126/44291616334/supremo-venezuela-candidato-elecciones-oposicion.html). Now opposition parties cannot participate on the presidential election.

[There were negotiations in 2018 between the opposition and Maduro](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics/venezuela-government-opposition-resume-talks-in-dominican-republic-idUSKBN1F12NC), but [Maduro stopped them.](https://prodavinci.com/gobierno-y-oposicion-salen-de-republica-dominicana-sin-acuerdo/)

There were three candidates from three small parties that were allowed to participate. [two of which were previous Maduro supporters](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/venezuela-elections-2018-key-points-180518100733025.html).

So, obviously, an election where the main opposition parties were not allowed to participate does not look like a democratic election at all; so [the international community refused to recognise the elections, labelling them as a farce](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-election-reaction/venezuelas-re-elected-maduro-faces-overseas-censure-idUSKCN1IM0CT).

So, from the international community point of view, there were no democratic elections in 2018; hence, there was no president-elect for the 2019-2025 period.

On January 10th 2019, [Maduro first term ended](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46821653), leaving Venezuela without a president for the 2019-2025 period, and according to the [Venezuelan constitution](http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/venezuela.pdf), if there is no president, the president of the National Assembly becomes the interim president.

>The idea behind Guaido's claim to the presidency, as far as I understand it, is that: a) [the 2018 Venezuelan Presidential election](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/world/americas/venezuela-election.html) was broadly declared [to be illegitimate and unconstitutional from the eyes of international observers and opposition parties](https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com/international-blogs/2018/5/30/rigged-elections-venezuelas-failed-presidential-election); b) by Articles 138 (""an usurped authority is of no effect"") and 350 (""the people of Venezuela ... shall disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates democratic values"") of [the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Venezuela_2009.pdf?lang=en), Maduro's election and second term as president was therefore illegitimate; and c) accepting this, by Article 233 of the Constitution, the President of the National Assembly (Juan Guaido) should preside as interim President until new elections are held and the inauguration of the new President takes place. Guaido really only stands as a transitional figure -- members of the National Assembly are even refraining from using the term ""President"" as that gives the impression of a more permanent regime.

As you can probably tell from above, the debate largely hinges on the question of whether the  2018 Venezuelan election can be considered legitimate. Why does the opposition view the 2018 election as illegitimate? Much of it hinges on [the 2017 election of the Constituent National Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Venezuelan_Constituent_Assembly_election), which was viewed pretty widely as illegitimate and anti-democratic as well (see the reactions section) for a list of complicated reasons that opens up an entire other debate about the [2017 constitutional crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Venezuelan_constitutional_crisis), and the [Supreme Tribunal of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Tribunal_of_Justice_(Venezuela)) versus the [Supreme Tribunal of Justice in exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Tribunal_of_Justice_of_Venezuela_in_exile) (this dispute is why most ignore the Supreme Court opinion that you mentioned); but I digress. A sample of reasons why the 2018 election is considered illegitimate include:

* the Constituent National Assembly (CNA, which Maduro formed to bypass the opposition-controlled National Assembly) [technically does not have the power to call a Presidential election](http://efectococuyo.com/politica/foro-penal-no-avala-convocatoria-a-elecciones-presidenciales/), as it did
* the CNA banned three of the most popular opposition parties (Primero Justicia, Accíon Democrática y Voluntad Popular) in the lead-up to the 2018 Presidential election, arguing that they'd lost legitimacy because they boycotted the previous 2017 local elections -- they then also banned the opposition coalition group
* the CNA itself is illegitimate according to many, with irregularities, [voter coercion](https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-state-worker-becomes-voice-against-voter-coercion-/3976544.html), and mass protests coming in the wake of its formation -- it's debatable whether Maduro had the constitutional authority to convene it in the first place, even
* there was reportedly a lot of vote-buying, selective voter exclusion, and bias among election officials, in line with the CNA election -- [this article provides a good summary](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article211209854.html)

To expound on the vote-buying aspect, I'd also written this comment:

>Most publicly, Maduro has been accused of [""dangl\[ing\] food for votes,""](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/world/americas/venezuela-election-president-maduro-food.html) insofar as having to vote at PSUV-run polling stations to receive their groceries. Outside of that, Maduro has extensively employed clientelism, holding rallies and promising/rewarding regional rewards for shows of support, such as [free oil for the Amazonas region](https://elpitazo.com/guayana/maduro-prometio-casas-gasolina-trabajo-puerto-ayacucho/) or [an airport for a town in Delta Amacuro](http://www.elmundo.com.ve/noticias/actualidad/regiones/gobierno-reactivo-aeropuerto-nacional-tucupita/). All of this, of course, is in direct violation of [Venezuelan electoral laws,](https://www.iidh.ed.cr/capel2016/media/1134/ley-org%C3%A1nica-de-procesos-electorales.pdf) among [many other activities](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/candidatos-incumplen-ley-electoral-realizar-campana-anticipada_229949) that do the same.  
>  
>Is there definitive proof for vote tampering? Not that I'm aware, and that's largely because independent international entities largely [declined](https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/venezuela-082012.html) to observe the election, under the reasoning that the invitations were for ""accompaniment"" as opposed to ""observation,"" that resources were perhaps better used on elections that were not so obviously illegitimate, and that the small time given to prepare a team of observers was far too small. Vote tampering is still very likely to have happened, however -- the company that provided Venezuela its election technology reported [that results had been tampered with in the previous CNA election](https://www.smartmatic.com/us/news/article/smartmatic-statement-on-the-recent-constituent-assembly-election-in-venezuela/) before being [subsequently expelled](https://www.smartmatic.com/us/news/article/smartmatic-announces-cease-of-operations-in-venezuela/), leaving no reason to expect more democratic behaviour from Maduro with less oversight. It's happened [again and again](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/10/23/what-more-proof-do-we-need-that-venezuelas-ruling-party-rigged-the-vote/?utm_term=.4ae9af6433a6) \-- should we suppose that it just didn't happen in the Presidential election?  
>  
>That being said, you don't need vote tampering for an illegitimate election. Any one of the three types of election manipulation that I listed -- ""vote-buying, selective voter exclusion, and bias among election officials"" -- is more than enough to constitute a fraudulent election, and there are certainly more than just these three. If this doesn't suffice, my professor has a [fairly comprehensive analysis](https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/Corrales%2520Venezuelan%2520Electoral%2520Irregularities%2520Feb%25206%25202018_0.pdf) on Maduro's (and Chavez's) electoral frauds in the past that you could read, for a wider picture as to why the PSUV's processes are so clearly undemocratic.

Of course, the military supports Maduro's regime, and so in the eyes of the military, the 2018 election is nonetheless legitimate, and Maduro is also the legitimate president. Regardless of the *de jure* reality, the *de facto* situation is that Maduro is the president of Venezuela. The [vast majority of Venezuelans don't support Maduro](https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-01-08/venezuelans-want-president-maduro-out-most-would-oppose-foreign-military) (and didn't leading up to his controversial decisions in 2017 and 2018), however, and so if you view it from a strictly democratic sense, it's hard to argue that he is the rightful president; [many are also skeptical of Guaido](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article238040219.html) due to the support he has from foreign countries and America's very questionable history with interventions and coups in Latin America, so he might not get as much sympathy there.",Ryanyu10,,hjyp2n,fwrj6pe
,"Juan Guaido is the rightful President of Venezuela, precisely as stated in the constitution in the event of an absentee President:

>when the president-elect is absolutely absent before taking office, a new election shall take place (...) And while the president is elected and takes office, the interim president shall be the president of the National Assembly.

Guaido was at the time the President of the National Assembly which was the last legitimately elected body of Venezuela. Now you may ask, why should Maduro be considered illegitimate as President if he was democratically elected. Well it's a very complicated subject, but in short, Maduro's regime has focused its efforts on legitimizing the [erosion of democratic institutions](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/31/venezuelas-crumbling-facade-democracy#) making it seem on the surface that everything is legal and democratic. This can be shown the most clearly in the years following the 2015 parliamentary elections, where the government scrambled to consolidate power and bypass the elected parliament. This resulted in the explosions of protests in 2017 when Maduro sought to [dismiss](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/americas/venezuelas-supreme-court-takes-power-from-legislature.html) the National Assembly.

Then in 2018, Maduro launched his Presidential campaign and prevented prominent opposition leaders from running on flimsy excuses. The main opposition candidate was someone known in opposition circles as a ""[Chavista crony](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/13793)"". It must be stated that while Falcon on the surface might seem as an anti-government type, he is distrusted due to how his rhetoric tends to align with that of the government.

That along with the various recognized irregularities, left the National Assembly with no other choice but to invoke the relevant article, stating that Venezuelan citizens should:

>""disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates democratic values, principles and guarantees or encroaches upon human rights”.

,"Ideology of the country (where someone is conservative, moderate, or liberal), has been pretty constant over the last 20+ years. [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/275792/remained-center-right-ideologically-2019.aspx) So it doesn’t seem that elections going from Republican or Democrat fundamentally change the ideology of the country. 

There have been two issues that have had a pretty strong flip over the last 15 or so years, support for lgbt rights and marijuana legalization, and whether that’s been affected by Democrats losing, Republicans winning, or a higher third party vote is up to anyone reading. 

The country at the moment is more social liberal than economically liberal. [Source](https://news.gallup.com/poll/311303/americans-remain-liberal-socially-economically.aspx) 29% of Americans identify as socially liberal, 21% as economically liberal. [this Gallup poll table make actually be more thorough](https://news.gallup.com/file/poll/311312/200520Ideology.pdf) There was a bump in the number of people who identified as socially liberal in 2011 in the country, going from about 25% for the last 10 or so years on file to about 30% of the country identifying as socially liberal. With regards to the percentage of the country that identifies as economically liberal, there’s been a small rise between 2007-2009, going from 15% to roughly 20% and staying there over the last 11 years. 

The two events that seem to correlate to this change a bit are the Great Recession of 2008 and Obama coming out in favor of gay marriage in 2011. That would be my guess. 

Anyways, as we are seeing with the George Floyd protests and the public over the last month or two taking the Black Lives Matter movement more seriously than before (10-20% jump in support in just one month), the big events beyond voting are more likely to change people’s attitudes, and as a result move the country further left or right. 

That said, I personally don’t see any evidence that Trump winning another term would make people more economically liberal. He was President over the last 4 years, and people’s views didn’t particularly move towards or away from liberal/conservatives. 

Those are my thoughts on this. But I will say that it’s very difficult to separate one’s own ideology from the question. It’s a very partisan, identity based question, rather than a less partisan, empirical policy based question. This was simply by best attempt, could be wrong.",NicolasName,,hi6qsf,fwg8y30
,"The explanation for the difference is that Roberts is a judicial conservative first and a political conservative second. He disagreed with the 2016 decision but feels that since the court made its ruling, that ruling remains binding.

From [SCOTUSblog](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/06/opinion-analysis-with-roberts-providing-the-fifth-vote-court-strikes-down-louisiana-abortion-law/):

>Roberts emphasized that he had disagreed with the majority’s decision to strike down the Texas admitting-privileges requirement in 2016 and still believed today that the Texas “case was wrongly decided.” Despite that conviction, Roberts nonetheless agreed with Breyer that the Louisiana law “cannot stand” because of a legal doctrine known as stare decisis – the idea that courts should generally not overrule their prior precedents. That doctrine, Roberts explained, “requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike.” Because the Louisiana admitting-privileges requirement “imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons,” Roberts concluded, it too must fall.

,"After oral argument, the Supreme Court meets  [in conference,](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1#) where only the Justices attend.

Leaks or other comments about what happens in conference happen, [but rarely enough to be notable.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/supreme-court-leaks-super-rare-serve-ulterior-purposes) The general points are hashed out in conference, in particular how everyone intends to vote.  


To jump ahead, this is probably where the Chief Justice has special influence. Whichever 'side' the CJ is on, they decide who is assigned to write the opinion. If the CJ isn't on that 'side, the decision goes to the senior Justice in that group. There is some attempts to keep the work evenly distributed between all the Justices (you'll sometimes see prognostication about how a future decision is going to go based on who, so far, has written opinions), but there can be strategy about it: CJ Burger, according to Bob Woodward in *The Brethren,* would sometimes side with the majority on something he otherwise would want to dissent about, because he could author the opinion himself and tailor something less broad than if he dissented.

Factions in conference are not fixed, and there is some degree of politicking that goes on, which involves clerks by necessity, over the writing of a decision. Justice Scalia [admitted](https://www.npr.org/2012/07/25/157319766/justice-scalia-disputes-accuracy-of-leak) to changing his mind even on a case that he was assigned to write. According to Justice Souter, as reported in David Kaplan's *The Most Dangerous Branch,* he would have flipped Justice Kennedy in *Bush v. Gore* if he had more time. 

Notably, though, to your question, Roberts is, technically, not part of the majority decision. It's more like a 4-1-4, a plurality where Roberts, while joining in the result, operates on his own logic, bringing the result to a lock while leaving the reasoning open.

# How the Supreme Court works

I think it would help if you learned some of the legalese that surrounds Supreme Court rulings so that if you happen to read another ruling it's not just a disgusting block of text. I hope some of this doesn't seem all too trivial and it helps somebody, I think as boring as some Supreme Court rulings are, others are very interesting and the more you understand the format of the text the less of a giant block of text it will seem. Also I think the rules are slightly different depending on the type of case it is, criminal or civil.

At the top of the document under JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES L. L. C. ET AL. v. RUSSO, INTERIM SECRETARY, LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HOSPITALS which is always in the format PLAINTIFF vs DEFENSE, so June Medical Services is bringing the case against Russo. 

This case was brought all the way up to the Supreme Court, so the way the US system works is that you have District Courts -> Circuit Courts (Appeals Court) -> Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's unique distinction (other than being practically the final say) is that they can choose what case to hear, so if they decided that the Appeal Court's ruling was completely fine then they could've just denied the appeal and it would've ended there, the Supreme Court takes very few cases a year and they know that their rulings have a lot of sway so they take only what is considered ""seminal"" cases.

Held: The judgment is reversed.

Pretty straightforward, the district court ruled it unconstitutional, the Appeals Court AGREED with the district court's interpretation of the constitution, but disagreed with the district court's actual evidence to support that interpretation. [The Supreme Court reverses the Appeal Court's decision and supports the District Courts opinion.](https://d2qwohl8lx5mh1.cloudfront.net/WWXS1vd9n8BJBBOAmeKZzA/content#page=8)

# [What are opinions / decision making process](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/how-to-read-a-u-s--supreme-court-opinion/)

> BREYER,  J.,  announced  the  judgment  of  the  Court  and  delivered  an  opinion, in which GINSBURG, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.  ROB-ERTS, C. J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  THOMAS, J., filed a dissenting opinion. ALITO, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which GOR-SUCH, J., joined, in which THOMAS, J., joined except as to Parts III–C and IV–F, and in which KAVANAUGH, J., joined as to Parts I, II, and III.  GOR-SUCH, J., and KAVANAUGH, J., filed dissenting opinions. 

To explain the decision making process I'll explain what opinions are. The general ones are MAJORITY, DISSENTING, PLURALITY, CONCURRING.

**Majority**: This is the decision of the Court as a whole. One role of the Chief Justice is that it is usually customary for the Chief Justice to write the majority opinion if they agree with that opinion, but they don't have to. Think of it as agreeing with the results AND the why

**Dissenting**: These are opinions that disagreed with the Supreme Court's ruling, disagreeing with the result AND the why

**Plurality**: These are majority opinions where the justices agreed with the results AND NOT the why

**Concurring**: These are opinions where the justices agreed with the results AND NOT the why

So looking at our document, Hon. Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined in Breyer's majority opinion meaning they agree with both the ruling and the reasoning. 

Hon. Chief Roberts filed a concurring opinion, so in the end he agreed with the results but not exactly the why, probably why he wasn't the one to write the majority opinion, because he didn't have a majority opinion.

Hon. Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, Hon. Alito filed a SEPARATE dissenting opinion (if Thomas agreed completely he probably wouldn't have selectively joined) joined by Hon. Gorsuch.

Hon. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh both filed dissenting opinions.

As to why Roberts did what he did? Well if you just look at the title of his opinion it's hard to gleam much from it, but the ""beauty"" of the Supreme Court opinions is that you can straight up read their thought processes and reasoning behind why they do what they do. 

[This is Chief Robert's concurring opinion
](https://d2qwohl8lx5mh1.cloudfront.net/WWXS1vd9n8BJBBOAmeKZzA/content#page=46). 

In fact he even mentions the 2016 case in his opinion. Understand that the Chief Justice is not above the other justice's, his vote still counts as one vote. The Chief Justice's role is more or less a glorified clerk, he sets the agenda for meetings, and does a [few more administrative things](https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/year-endreports.aspx), but [as shown in the pay scale they don't really get paid that much more, everyone's role at the Supreme Court is very similar.](https://www.thoughtco.com/chief-justice-of-united-states-duties-3322405). 

Being a Chief Justice won't mean that Hon. Roberts won't have a different opinion just because he's the Chief Justice. 

# So what do Supreme Court procedures mean for the law

Just imagine court cases as this subreddit on hyper-overdrive, every document is littered with references to previous case, previous opinions, and you need to have evidence to back up every statement you make. The whole point of the Supreme Court having these 138 page long documents where they describe their reasoning is exactly so that it can be referenced in the future. One thing to know is that just because one side lost doesn't mean that in the future a suave lawyer can't reference a dissenting opinion as a possible positive evidence for their case, the overall decision is just a small facet of what makes a decision a decision, the reasoning is arguably much more important. The Supreme Court deliberates just like any other court, and you can find similar court documents down to the small District Court. 

----
This might be edging into opinion, but the Supreme Court is not the Chief Justice's court, it belongs to all of them equally. Chief Roberts can't just walk up to Sotomeyer and tell her what to do, among themselves their opinions are equal, and this might be rose-colored glasses but even though many of them heavily disagree with each other I think they all respect each other as peers and understand the weight of their position.",ElderKingpin,,hi84h1,fwkj4v6

,"There are several moving pieces in all of this: the scope of Congressional power, the way the ACA works (or was intended to work), and the legal doctrine of severability.

Congress is granted certain [enumerated powers](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/historical-documents/united-states-constitution/thirty-enumerated-powers/) by the Constitution.  The tenth amendment [holds](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment):

>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.

Without diving to deep, this basically means that Congress can only pass legislation deriving from an enumerated power.  In [NFIB v. Sebelius](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/11-393.pdf), opponents attacked the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that the individual mandate (the requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or pay a penalty) was unconstitutional because it did not derive from an enumerated power.  The initial debates focused on whether the [commerce clause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause) (the enumerated power at the foundation of much of contemporary federal law) gave Congress this power.   Initially, the justices were prepared to strike down the ACA on commerce clause grounds.

For whatever reason, Chief Justice Roberts [switched his position](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roberts-switched-views-to-uphold-health-care-law/) and arrived at the view that, while the individual mandate exceeded the authority of the commerce clause, it was constitutional as a form of taxation (thus deriving from the Congressional taxing power) because the penalty for not buying insurance was a tax.  This led the court to uphold the law.  Interestingly enough, Justice Kavanaugh (who was at that time serving as an appeals court judge) appears to [hold basically the same view](https://www.scotusblog.com/2018/07/kavanaugh-on-the-affordable-care-act-seven-sky-v-holder/) of the law as Chief Justice Roberts.  In his opinion in NFIB v. Sebelius, Roberts however expressed his personal opinion that the individual mandate would have been unconstitutional under the commerce clause.   There are some really complicated technicalities here that I can address separately but will leave aside for now.

In 2017, Congress set the penalty for not buying insurance [to zero](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20171220.323429/full/) without actually eliminating the mandate.  That is, you're legally required to have health insurance, but there's no penalty if you don't have it.   Opponents of the law now contend that you can't have a zero dollar tax, so the individual mandate is now unconstitutional because the taxing power no longer supports it.

That then takes us to how the ACA works. There are three major components to the ACA: 1) the individual mandate (people must have health insurance or pay a penalty), 2) protection for pre-existing conditions (insurers cannot deny coverage for pre-existing conditions), and 3) Medicaid expansion (making federally provided Medicaid insurance more widely available).   There is a debate about how these relate to each other, but it's clear that #1 and #2 are closely connected because of [adverse selection](https://www.verywellhealth.com/adverse-selection-what-it-is-how-health-plans-avoid-it-1738416#:~:text=Adverse%20selection%20in%20health%20insurance,people%20don't%20buy%20it).  The problem is: if insurers can't deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, then what if people just wait until they get sick to buy insurance?  In that scenario, perhaps no one would want to sell insurance and the market would collapse.

This takes us to the legal doctrine of [severability](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/opinion/the-severability-doctrine.html).  Suppose the law's opponents are correct and  the individual mandate is now unconstitutional with the penalty at zero dollars.  What does that mean for the rest of the law?  There are cases where striking one part of a law clearly invalidates the remainder.  Imagine a law that establishes: 1) a crime and 2) a penalty for that crime.  If a court strikes down #1, then #2 is clearly invalid as well.   So, how that apply to the ACA? If you strike down the individual mandate, then was that provision so important to the law that the entire law should be taken off the books? The contention of the law's opponent is that the answer is yes and that, because the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the remainder of the law *while constitutional* has to be struck down because it no longer ""works"" without the individual mandate.

[Usually](https://www.congressionalinstitute.org/2012/04/18/judicial-review-and-severability/#:~:text=If%20a%20law%20contains%20unconstitutional,constitutional%20sections%20to%20stand%20alone), the way a court would approach an issue like this is to ask hypothetically: ""If Congress had known that provision X was unconstitutional, would it have passed the law without it?""  If yes, then the court upholds the remainder of the law.  If no, it strikes it down.

The interesting thing in this case is that we actually know the answer to that hypothetical question.  On July 27, 2017, the Senate voted 51-49 [against](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/obamacare-partial-repeal-senate-republicans-revolt.html) repealing the ACA.  On December 17, 2017, Congress [voted in favor](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-senate-live-vote.html) (as part of the tax bill) of setting the penalty to zero.  The Solicitor General's position is that the December vote actually struck down the whole ACA (the very thing that the Senate had explicitly not done in July).  That, in effect, a vote to set the penalty to zero was actually a vote to repeal the whole law *even though we know that's not what the Senate wanted to do.*

That may make it sound like the eventual outcome of the case is clear.  I wouldn't go that far.  For a variety of (basically sound) reasons, courts are reluctant to look at what Congress appears to have intended, and there is (logically) a clear connection between the individual mandate and the protection for pre-existing conditions.  You also have to keep in mind that the court's conservatives on this issue (certainly Thomas and Alito probably Gorsuch) want to strike the law down period.  That leaves the case in the hands of Roberts and Kavanaugh, and there's no way to be sure what they will do.",chadtr5,,hgtl9h,fw9jcbu
,"The case itself is quite asinine from a legal standpoint. Even among conservatives who have been involved in challenging the law in the past.

>	Jonathan Adler, a conservative law professor — and a leading evangelist for an earlier lawsuit seeking to undercut the Affordable Care Act by reading a poorly drafted provision of the law to cut off much of the act’s funding — labeled many of the red states’ arguments “implausible,” “hard to justify,” and “surprisingly weak.” The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board labeled this lawsuit the “Texas Obamacare Blunder.” Yuval Levin, a prominent conservative policy wonk, wrote in the National Review that the Texas lawsuit “doesn’t even merit being called silly.

Sebelius* (decision written by Roberts) and how their decision that it isn’t severable from the remainder of the ACA even if the tax portion is now not legal is also extremely suspect and at odds with the legal test previously established by the Supreme Court.",bailtail,,hgtl9h,fw6eomr
,"Your question has to do with the notion of [severability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severability).  The SG's argument in part rests on the ACA as written, since the 2010 Congress labeled the individual mandate as “essential” to its goal of “creating effective health insurance markets."" (See, e.g., [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/reason.com/2019/07/08/my-concluding-thoughts-on-severability-in-texas-v-u-s/%3famp))

The general idea is that the main provisions of the ACA (whatever they might be) were intended to be inseverable, meaning that if one of main provisions is repealed or considered unconstitutional, then the entire law must be struck down. The issue is that the ACA does not have a severability clause, so there is a debate as to whether the law ought to stand.",atlas1171,,hgtl9h,fw6me8p
,"I am not a lawyer but am in healthcare. As I was taught, previous challenges to ACA at the Supreme Court were unsuccessful due largely to the ability of Congress to enact taxes which the individual mandate was a tax penalty in terms of enforcement (ie you pay a higher tax due to not having insurance and why everyone who gets their insurance from their job gets a tax form attesting to their coverage) 

Source for background on prior rulings: https://www.chlpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SCOTUS_ACA_Summary_6-29-12.pdf

The question is now that the tax provision has been repealed the individual mandate appears to have no legal authority and so will go away. Absent an individual mandate, what role is there for federal tax credits to subsidize purchases of coverage on the exchange? What is the reaction of private insurers to their premium price? These are undecided issues but not likely to be positive for the average consumer. Plus there were a lot of things “purchased” with the individual mandate from a legal standpoint such as not being able to exclude pre existing conditions. In this way the structure of the ACA seems to suggest the law will unravel on itself due to the lack of individual mandate either because of court ruling which will invalidate aspects of the law or due to changes in the market as reactionary to the changed structure

In addition, 81% of health economists voiced their [support](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4408001/) for the individual mandate and believed it was integral to the ACA's success, so I would think that getting rid of it would invalidate the ACA.

,"Axios [has a pretty decent primer](https://www.axios.com/michael-flynn-explainer-barr-trump-obamagate-6799dabb-5db1-4169-b5dc-e0968228a0b1.html). Of note:

> The DOJ case that Flynn may not have intentionally misled the FBI comes despite the fact that Flynn himself admitted in court to having lied.

> The FBI interview also came after both Pence and Spicer had publicly denied that Flynn discussed sanctions with Kislyak.

> That prompted concerns that Flynn could have been vulnerable to blackmail from the Kremlin, which was obviously aware that sanctions had been discussed.
This posed a potential national security threat that defenders of the FBI say justified the interview and the continuation of the counterintelligence probe.

But the things that bother me the most, is the about-face the DOJ took to whether the lies were material or not.

Here's [one filing done in 1/7/2020](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.191592/gov.uscourts.dcd.191592.150.0_1.pdf):

> The defendant’s false statements to the FBI were significant. When it interviewed the defendant, the FBI did not know the totality of what had occurred between the defendant and the Russians. Any effort to undermine the recently imposed sanctions, which were enacted to punish the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 election, could have been evidence of links or coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia. Accordingly, determining the extent of the defendant’s actions, why the defendant took such actions, and at whose direction he took those actions, were critical to the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation.

And then [another later on filed in May](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.191592/gov.uscourts.dcd.191592.198.0_6.pdf):

> The Government is not persuaded that the January 24, 2017 interview was conducted with a legitimate investigative basis and therefore does not believe Mr. Flynn’s statements were material even if untrue. Moreover, we not believe that the Government can prove either the relevant false statements or
their materiality beyond a reasonable doubt.

That's one hell of a flip-flop. If they used the ""new information"" listed in the Axios article above to justify the flop, it doesn't hold water to me.

And the kicker to me, beyond all the other aspects, is that he wouldn't have even had any potential jail time had he cooperated fully, based on the first filing:

> The defendant is now scheduled to be sentenced almost exactly three years from the date of his primary criminal conduct – lying to the FBI – and the intervening years have included periods where the defendant has sought to assist and aid the government, and periods where the defendant has sought to thwart the efforts of the government to hold other individuals, principally Bijan Rafiekian, accountable for criminal wrongdoing. Given the serious nature of the defendant’s offense, his apparent failure to accept responsibility, his failure to complete his cooperation in – and his affirmative efforts to undermine – the prosecution of Bijan Rafiekian, and the need to promote respect for the law and adequately deter such criminal conduct, the
government recommends that the court sentence the defendant within the applicable Guidelines range of 0 to 6 months of incarceration.

In case you need a primer on [Bijan Rafiekian](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-tosses-conviction-against-michael-flynn-s-ex-lobbying-partner-n1058386), he was a partner to Flynn while they were both working for Turkey as unregistered foreign agents. One of the other things Flynn could have been brought up on charges for and never was (and Bijan was convicted by jury of those same charges, yet the conviction was tossed by another judge)

I can't understand, beyond a corrupt explanation, why the DOJ would try to drop the guilty pleas that had already been accepted. Not for this man, who was doing unregistered work for Turkey *while he was the National Security Advisor*. And then lied about that work and the conversations he had with Kislyak *to federal investigators*.",Darsint,,hf3aqv,fvwnrza
,"The Flynn case is complex, but the underlying conduct is very simple.

The relevant crime is [18 U.S. Code § 1001](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001):

>\[W\]hoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of ... the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully... makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement ... shall be fined under this title \[and/or\] imprisoned not more than 5 years.

Nearly all of the relevant underlying materials have been released, so it's not hard to judge for yourself if you think Flynn committed this crime.

The underlying facts pertain to Flynn's calls with Russian Ambassador Kislyak.  The FBI monitors and records Russian communications for their potential intelligence value so you can read transcripts of these calls,  most of which are now declassified, [here](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6933340/Flynn-Transcripts.pdf).  There are two separate issues of substance: one about a UN vote on Israel and one about Russian sanctions.   One of the relevant Israel calls was not declassified, so I'll just cover Russia.

On December 29, 2016, Flynn called Ambassador Kislyak (transcript starts at p. 13 of the PDF).  After some discussion of other matters, including setting up a call between Trump and Putin, Flynn states:

>Listen, uh, a couple of things.  Number one, what I would you guys to do -- and make sure you, make sure that you convey this, okay? - do not, do not uh, allow this administration to box us in, right now, okay?

What Flynn is referring to there is the imposition of sanctions on Russia by the Obama administration in response to Russian election interference and the way that Russia might respond to this.  Kislyak replies, then Flynn continues:

>So, you know, depending on, depending on what uh, actions they \[the Obama administration\] take over this current issue of the cyber stuff \[i.e., the hacking of the DNC and Podesta emails by Russian intelligence\], you know, where they're looking like they're gonna, they're gonna dismiss some number of Russians out of the country, I understand all that and I understand that, that, you know, the information that they have and all that, but what I would ask Russia to do is to not -- is - is -- if anything, because I know you have to have some sort of action -- to, to only make it reciprocal.  Make it reciprocal.  Don't -- don't make it -- don't go any further than you have to.  Because I don't want us to get into anything that has to escalate, on a, you know, on a tit for tat.

After some back and forth,  Flynn continues:

>... we need to cool heads to prevail, and huh, and we need to be very steady about what we're going to do because we have absolutely a common uh, threat in the Middle East right now

Kislyak replies:

>We agree. One of the problems among the measures that have been announced today \[sanctions by the Obama administration\] is that now FSB and GRU  \[Russian intelligence agencies\] are sanctions, are sanctioned, and I ask myself, uh, does it mean that the United States isn't willing to work on terrorist threats?

Flynn replies:

>Yeah, yeah ... So that's something that we have to deal with.  But I've heard what you say, and I will certainly try

I haven't quoted it all, but generally, this conversation about sanctions takes up half the call.

There is a follow up call between the two men on December 31 (starting at PDF page 19) in which they discuss the (limited as Flynn requested) Russian response to the sanctions then move on to some other topics.   Of particular relevance:

>KISLYAK: I have a small message to pass to you from Moscow and uh, probably you have heard about the decision taken by Moscow about action and counter-action.  
>  
>FLYNN: yeah, yeah well I appreciate it, you know, on our phone call the other day, you know, I, I, appreciate the steps that uh your president has taken.  I think it is was wise.  
>  
>KISLYAK: I, I just wanted to tell you that our conversation was also taken into account in Moscow and...  
>  
>FLYNN: Good  
>  
>KISLYAK: Your proposal that we need to act with cold heads, uh, is exactly what is uh, invested in the decision  
>  
>FLYNN: Good ...  
>  
>KISLYAK: So, so I just wanted to let you know that our conversation was taken with weight.

About a month later, on January 24, 2017, the FBI interviewed Flynn about these calls.  The interview was conducted by two agents, one of whom was Peter Strzok (of text messages fame).

You can see the 302 (summary of the interview with Flynn) [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5633264-12-17-18-Redacted-Flynn-Interview-302.html).  Of the most relevance:

>The interviewing agents asked FLYNN if he recalled any \[convers\]ation with KISLYAK surrounding the expulsion of Russian diplomats or closing of Russian properties in response to Russian hacking activities surrounding the election.  FLYNN stated that he did not ... Flynn noted he was not aware of the then-upcoming actions as he did not have access to television news in the Dominican Republic and his government BlackBerry was not working.  
>  
>The interviewing agents asked FLYNN if he recalled any conversation with KISLYAK in which the expulsions were discussed, where FLYNN might have encouraged KISLYAK not to escalate the situation, to keep the Russian response reciprocal, or not to engage in a ""tit-for-tat.""  Flynn responded, ""Not really.  I don't remember.  It wasn't, \`Don't do anything.'""...  
>  
>The interviewing agents asked FLYNN if he recalled any conversation with KISLYAK in which KISLYAK told him the Government of Russia had taken into account the incoming administration's position about the expulsions, or where KISLYAK said the Government of Russia had responded, or chosen to modulate their response, in any way to the U.S.'s actions as a result of a request by the incoming administration.  FLYNN stated it was possible that he talked to KISLYAK on the issue but, if he did, he did not remember doing so... FLYNN reflected and stated that he did not think he would have had a conversation with KISLYAK about the matter, as he did not know the expulsions were coming. FLYNN stated he did not have a long drawn out discussion with KISYLAK where he would have asked him to ""don't do something.""

As you can clearly see by comparing what Flynn said in the transcripts to what he said to the FBI, most of those statements were false.    Now, you'll note that there's a fair amount of hedging from Flynn - a lot of ""I don't remember.""

It's possible that Flynn actually didn't remember the conversations he had with Flynn.  If that's the case, then he didn't lie to the FBI.  You can put yourself in the shoes of a hypothetical juror and ask if you think it's plausible that Flynn forgot.

But, this is not actually the defense that Flynn has been presenting.  Flynn pled guilty (several times actually) and admitted that he lied.  The present controversy concerns something different: whether the lies were material.  Roughly, the position that Flynn has adopted (and recently the government changed its mind to support this: [here](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6936-michael-flynn-motion-to-dismiss/fa06f5e13a0ec71843b6/optimized/full.pdf)) is that the FBI should never have been talking to Flynn in the first place.

It's helpful here to proceed by way of analogy.  Suppose that the FBI started going door-to-door in your neighborhood asking people incredibly intrusive questions about their personal lives (e.g., ""Can you recall a time you masturbated while thinking about \[embarrassing person\]?"")  Replying untruthfully to such questions would potentially expose you and your neighbors to criminal prosecution for false statements, but I think we can all agree that the FBI has no business going around and asking people questions like that.  It would be manifestly unfair to pointlessly interview people about their sex lives and then prosecute them for lying. (continues)",chadtr5,,hf3aqv,fvyhfl3
,"It's hard to find neutral fact based articles but I think it comes down to mistakes/corruption from all parties. The FBI used a case that should have been closed as a pretext to question Flynn (legal but kinda shady). Flynn lied during that interview (a criminal act). AG Bar used his (legal) authority to intervene. As attorney general it is within his power, however that power is not supposed to be used to help political allies. The judge then overreached his authority essentially taking a prosecutorial stance. 

Hopefully this meets community guidelines because it is supposition but I think it has grounds in facts and is plausible.

,"[Here's a typically excellent summary from Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/flynn-redux-what-those-fbi-documents-really-show) about the background of the case and what new information came out from additional documents at the end of April. However, it's from May 1st, before the Justice Department suddenly reversed its position. That's actually one of the possible outcomes the Lawfare article predicted (vaguely) a week earlier. See also [this FactCheck.org timeline of Flynn's activity in question](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/12/michael-flynns-russia-timeline/), though it ends in December 2017 so it doesn't cover much of the legal proceedings.

Brief outline:

* Flynn had been secretly and illegally working as a paid lobbyist for the government of Turkey, possibly even involved (along with his son) in a plot to kidnap an enemy of the Turkish president, while advising the Trump campaign on foreign policy. He also had close connections and illegally undisclosed paid gigs with RT and other Russian firms.
* After Trump won the election, but before he took office (so before Flynn held any appropriate position in the government), Flynn had several conversations with the Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak regarding the sanctions that were being enacted as retaliation for the Russian attack on the election; Flynn assured Kislyak that there was no need to escalate because the Trump administration would abandon the retaliatory sanctions as soon as it took office. These phone conversations were intercepted by American surveillance of the Russian ambasador.
* Shortly after Flynn began his short run as National Security Advisor, the FBI interviewed him about those conversations, and he lied, concealing the extent of his then-unauthorized diplomatic negotiation.
* As the investigation of the Russian attack heated up, Flynn, who was already disgraced and fired for lying about the Kislyak conversations, naturally became a person of interest. With the aid of an elite law firm he first attempted an immunity deal with Congress, in exchange for his testimony in their Russia investigation, but eventually got a similar cooperation deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller instead; the only crime to which he had to plead guilty was lying to the FBI about the conversations with the ambassador. Flynn also cooperated in [the prosecution of his Turkish lobbying partner.](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/07/criminal-case-rafiekian-flynn-partner-306881)
* Late in the legal proceedings, when Flynn's case was ready to proceed to sentencing, he abruptly fired the elite law firm and hired an obscure-within-her-profession lawyer who was mainly known to a different crowd for her [advocacy](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/sidney-powell-michael-flynns-new-attorney-anti-mueller-conspiracy-theorist-and-fox-regular) of pro-Trump messaging and conspiracy theories (QAnon, Soros, etc.). She took a vastly different approach, arguing both in court and in the press that her client was improperly coerced into his plea deal, and asking leave of the court to withdraw his guilty plea.
* An investigator appointed by the Attorney General to review the case obtained further evidence supporting the arguments of Flynn's new attorney that his case was handled improperly. Specifically, documents showed that before interviewing Flynn the FBI considered using his likely lying, which they did not consider worth pursuing for its own sake, as leverage to secure his cooperation in their already ongoing investigation of the Russian attack, which is what eventually happened. Other documents showed that the FBI also considered using unspecified possible charges against his son as additional leverage. For better or worse these are normal FBI tactics and unlikely to convince a judge of misconduct, but they spin very differently in the political media.
* In a shocking move, the DOJ [abandoned its previous position](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/us/politics/michael-flynn-case-dropped.html) and adopted the defense's arguments that the DOJ itself had conducted the Flynn inquiry improperly and therefore it requested leave of the court to drop the case. This decision was signed by an interim attorney appointed by the Attorney General, after all original prosecutors on the Flynn case abruptly resigned without explanation. 
* In another shocking move, the judge did not immediately grant the motion to drop the charges, and instead [appointed](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/10/gleeson-flynn-sullivan-barr-justice-department-311018) a former judge to take the DOJ's place and argue the other side of whether Flynn's case should be dropped or he should be held in contempt of court. The defense appealed and this morning a panel from the appeals court [ruled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/appeals-court-orders-judge-dismiss-michael-flynn-case-n1231988) that the judge must dismiss the case without further arguments, though it is [likely](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/legal-experts-stunned-by-d-c-circuits-michael-flynn-decision-call-for-review-by-full-court/) that will be reconsidered by the entire circuit court.",Epistaxis,,hf3aqv,fvwwmk3
,">Flynn requested that Russia not retaliate against the punitive measures just imposed by the U.S

The transcript released of the call shows that they didn't talk about sanctions except Kislyak mentioning it in passing and Flynn basically 'yeah-yeahing' it. 

Regarding the measures that Obama admin had recently taken, he wanted Russia to make the response reciprocal rather than escalating it to a higher degree. Pretty sure it meant retaliation.

,"First, it’s worth noting the very next section in the [repeal provided by OP](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACA5) states the intent of Proposition 209 was to :

> WHEREAS, Proposition 209, entitled the California Civil Rights Initiative, amended Article I of the California Constitution to prohibit race- and gender-conscious remedies to rectify the underutilization of women and people of color in public employment, as well as public contracting and education; and

To this end, there is evidence that Proposition 209 did negatively effect equal opportunity for POC, particularly in it’s most well known application : race-blind admissions into California’s public universities. 

Immediately following it’s passage, UC’s  saw a drop in underrepresented students (commonly defined as African American, Latinos, Pacific Islanders and American Indians) from [20% in 1995 to 15% in 1998](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-15/uc-regents-to-consider-backing-affirmative-action). UC Berkley saw a  [58% drop in admitted California underrepresented students](https://www.kqed.org/news/57464/despite-diversity-efforts-uc-minority-enrollment-down-since-prop-209) in this time period, leading the population of underrepresented students to drop from 27% to 12% of the school’s admitted body. Likewise, UCLA saw a similar drop of 53 % drop in admitted underrepresented Californians. 

While these percentages have increased since 1998, UC’s have admitted that enrollment has not kept pace with the [changing demographics of  California’s graduating high school students](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/thefacts_diversity_0313.pdf). Furthermore, [African American, Latino and Native American enrollment](https://www.kqed.org/news/11679792/californias-gone-without-higher-ed-affirmative-action-since-1996-black-enrollment-at-top-ucs-never-recovered) numbers have either not recovered to pre-Prop 209 levels, particularly at elite UC’s like Berkley or UCLA, or still not proportional to high school graduate demographics. 

As a side note, some Asian American organizations, like those partnered with [Edward Blum in the failed lawsuit against Harvard](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/harvard-admissions-lawsuit.html), point to the passage of Proposition 209 as an example of how race based selection discriminates against Asian Americans since total AAPI [enrollment increased following it’s passage](http://care.gseis.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/care-brief-raceblind.pdf).  However, the increase attendance did not correspond with an increase in acceptance rates, and in fact, AAPIs saw acceptance rates stay the same or even decrease. Thus concluding the aforementioned study to state

> The use of enrollment numbers to evaluate the effects of admissions policies is methodologically erroneous. The correlation between increased Asian American undergraduate enrollment on UC campuses and the implementation of race-blind admissions policies in California does not suggest a causal relationship between the two occurrences, as demonstrated by the decline in the rate of admissions for AAPI applicants at UC campuses since 1998. The increase in AAPI enrollment at UC campuses was most likely caused by significant demographic shifts in the state and a higher yield rate among admitted AAPI applicants. 

The one possibly good result of Prop 209 was evidence that suggests graduation rates of minorities [increased 3% to 7%](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/prop209.pdf) following it's passage, possibly indicating a sorting/matching effect. However this improvement in graduation rate could be seen not as an increase equity of opportunity, but evidence that Prop 209 reinforced existing systems especially when studies suggest that underrepresented students [aren't bothering to apply to these elite UC's](https://www.kqed.org/news/11679792/californias-gone-without-higher-ed-affirmative-action-since-1996-black-enrollment-at-top-ucs-never-recovered). It's this kind of data that led the former UC president [to write in 2003](https://currents.ucsc.edu/02-03/04-21/opinion.html)

>But I offer California as a cautionary tale to the rest of the nation. Our experience to date shows that if race cannot be factored into admissions decisions at all, the ethnic diversity of an elite public institution such as the University of California may fall well behind that of the state it serves. And that is something that should trouble us all.

,"In general, the foundations of justice (using [John Rawls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls)), rely on [two principles](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/):

1. Principle of Equal Liberty: Each person has an equal right to the most extensive liberties compatible with similar liberties for all.

2. Difference Principle: Social and economic inequalities should be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged persons, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of equality of opportunity.

These were the core principles Rawls could come up with when all was said and done. He'd based his concept on the thought experiment of the Original Position. Roughly stated, if you didn't know what you'd be born as, but could pick the rules of said society before you were born, you'd want to make sure you were treated equally under the law and societal norms. So that way, you'd never have to gamble that you'd get placed in an advantageous or disadvantageous position. Likewise, providing unequal treatment to improve the least-well-off means that no matter what circumstances you were subject to outside your control, you'd still have a decent chance.

The Principle of Equal Liberty is based in equality. The Difference Principle is based in equity.

Now this is philosophy, not studies, but the logic should be sound.

Remind me tomorrow about the studies, so I can ask my wife. She's studying for a PhD in Education and has access to a lot of in-depth research at her level.

EDIT: She found [From Legal Doctrine to Social Transformation? Comparing U.S. Voting Rights, Equal Employment Opportunity, and Fair Housing Legislation](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/692094), and I think it has a lot of useful insights into these discussions. One of the first parts strikes me as an interesting change of scope:

> We address these questions through historical-comparative anal-
ysis of three potentially transformative civil rights laws: Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, sex, religion, and national origin), the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA; removing systemic barriers to minority voters), and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (FHA; banning race, religious, and national origin discrimination in the sale and rental of housing). Historical evidence reveals — and civil rights scholars concur — that voting rights was by far the most successful of the three; fair housing was a general failure; and Title VII fell somewhere in between, achieving a modicum of success that surpassed fair housing but came nowhere near the achievements of voting rights.

> What explains these divergent outcomes? Scholarly literature in political sociology suggests that civil rights policy success is conditioned on state-internal resources including formal enforcement powers, established bureaucratic infrastructure and capacities, or aggressive “policy entrepreneurs.” Another argument ties civil rights policy success to the degree of white support or resentment. Although each of these arguments helps interpret and explain particular civil rights policy outcomes, none adequately explains comparative outcomes across all three cases. We offer an alternative that can do so.

> Theoretically grounded in the sociology of law, we argue that divergent outcomes of U.S. voting, employment, and housing legislation can be explained best by the extent to which each incorporated a statutory and enforcement model we call the group-centered effects (GCE) framework. The GCE framework provides a sociologically driven legal and cultural frame of reference for defining, proving, and remedying unlawful discrimination. The
framework focuses on systemic group disadvantage rather than individual
harm, discriminatory consequences rather than discriminatory intent, and
substantive, remedial group results rather than formal procedural justice for individual victims or alleged wrongdoers.",Darsint,,he6w27,fvpstfd
,"They will anyways (as I try to show in the argument below). There's evidence that \*not\* letting them discriminate however is taking away a conscientious correction for an unconscious bias, as well.   


To start with, the name hiring effect is well known  
[https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)  


Basically you send the same resume to the same employers but with the names changed to sound like the dominate culture or not. Even though they're the same resumes/CVs, the ones with names from the dominant culture are more likely to be accepted.

It shows up in grading (i.e. same test different grades correlating with how dominant-culture the name sounds), and I want to link to American studies but google's only giving me German studies right now

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-012-0609-x](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-012-0609-x)

But, well, colloquially it's been well known for decades.

Not finding it because google-fu sucks rn, but admissions are widely said to suffer the same biases. 

&#x200B;

So just anonymize them, right? Well that might work for multiple choice tests, but anything involving essay responses is going to cause problems as well. 

Language is developmental and biological. There is a critical period for acquiring language [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical\_period\_hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period_hypothesis) . This applies to second language acquisition - as well as acquisition of dialect or register - as well. That means that after the critical period passes, the task becomes substantially more difficult, if not impossible. It's why adult learners of second languages never seem to quite lose their accents (and conversely, why early-age immigrants don't always have their parents' accents).

Now picture this - you speak a language that's mutually comprehensible with a dominant language, but differently, in subtle but critical ways, like the number of tenses and aspects in your language [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American\_Vernacular\_English#Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English#Grammar) But it's critically so close that even with education the subtleties aren't even questioned and because of the second language effects your mother's tongue is always going to color your formal language. The far less subtle effects of this in plain spoken speech might have influenced the ruling in the Zimmerman trial [https://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/december/vernacular-trial-testimony-120214.html](https://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/december/vernacular-trial-testimony-120214.html)

&#x200B;

So imagine something as subtle as the differences between

""This leads us to the question of whether the conclusion follows the hypothesis.""

and

""This leads us to the question, 'does the conclusion follow the hypothesis?'""

building up and giving away the race of the speaker. It's absurd.

&#x200B;

So these clues lead into the name grading effect resurfacing \*even if you anonymize the names\*. Even if you attempt to legislate 'neutrality' in this respect, you can \*not\* feasibly hide the effects of ethnic and linguistic background from a discriminatory system, however laudible your attempts may be. 

And because they aren't in a protected pool where they're being graded against each other, but rather by more linguistically conservative speakers closer to the prestige written dialect, they're put at a disadvantage in the overall hiring/grading/admissions process, because of that name-grading effect.",tovarischkrasnyjeshi,,he6w27,fvt4kf4

,"I don't think it's motivation is racial but the outcome gives the impression it is. The way our police system is set up is something that looks good on paper, you lower police presence in low crime areas and raise it in high crime areas but when the high crime areas are also majority black then it does look like profiling. On top of this, veterans and people transitioning out of the military are a huge recruiting source for police but the way you are trained in the military is to respond to any potential threats without hesitation and with force, it becomes wired into their instinct and is very hard to break:

[https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/03/30/when-warriors-put-on-the-badge#:\~:text=Policing%20has%20long%20been,data%20performed%20by%20Gregory%20B.](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/03/30/when-warriors-put-on-the-badge#:~:text=Policing%20has%20long%20been,data%20performed%20by%20Gregory%20B.)

Military training also doesn't make you more likely to shoot black over white, as Jihadists are a pretty diverse group and often look white more than black in the areas where the US had boots on the ground. Cases of whites being shot are very common but due to a higher police presence in low-income black neighborhoods blacks end up getting shot more on average. Of course there are individual officers who are racist and sadistic lunatics but the system itself is not designed to target any one race.

With that being said I by no means think that because the intention isn't racial that there is no problem, I actually think there is a massive flaw in the way law enforcement operates. Even if police are well trained and behaved with no incidents, they will still be seen as outsiders trying to assert authority over the locals if they police communities they aren't from. On the other side, police are less considerate in how they deal with people when they don't have to face them at the end of the day after they take their uniform off and go home. That is something that will lead to incidents that build tension over time until you see what is happening now. Until police only police the communities they are from then I see no real end to the problem.

As far as vets, if they stopped hiring veterans you lose 20% of police staff which will leave them severely understaffed. That issue I'm less certain on what needs to be done.

As far as other suggested solutions like defunding or abolishing police, that is only sensible as far as the drug war, you can save money by ending it and shifting away from a punitive approach to one focused on treatment but everything above that is sheer fantasy.

,"As people have alluded to, Baltimore has fallen victim to deindustrialization, explicitly racist zoning policies, and general corruption of the city administration.  A few other factors at play though...

[The port of Baltimore is one of the leading points of entry for drugs into the United States](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/record-cocaine-seizure-port-of-baltimore/28184012).  Because it’s situated on the Northeast Corridor, and port security is generally worse than other major ports in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, a lot of drugs flow into the city.

If you’re poor, you can’t easily move to DC with affordable housing to get the high paying jobs DC offers, not to mention a preponderance of DCs jobs require higher education, which many poor families obviously lack.

So, Baltimore is in a death spiral - most high income earners are leaving, being replaced below replacement level by white, college educated millennials who typically rent, coupled with an influx of drugs and a sleepy economy.

,"To a certain extent, I would argue that in Baltimore its a failure of the war on drugs. Fundamentally, we have no idea what to do about the american underclass which has developed in the worst areas of Baltimore. The economic reality is that the drug trade is lucrative, and to go legitimate is really not feasible (try reading David Simons The Corner, a dated reflection of Baltimore but accurate still in many ways.)

The police in those minority neighborhoods has a deficit of trust. The War on Drugs has made a mockery of the 4th Amendment and probable cause for many folks in the city. And if those folks know the cops will lie over drug searches, how is a city prosecutor going to be able to convict with a city jury? How are the police going to be able to cultivate informants to solve those homicides? 

On the other hand, in the worst neighborhoods in Baltimore, most of the adult population has sustained a drug charge. The business of those neighborhoods could legitimately be called the drug trade. And in those neighborhoods, the police no longer knew them when they were worth something. They've only seen them when the occupants of the neighborhood view them as the enemy. Taxpayers persist in those neighborhoods. It is here we see places that are overpoliced on drug charges, but underpoliced on violent crime. Homicides in the city are reaching 1990's levels with a city 100,000 people smaller. Further, the homicide solve rate is ~40%, which is abysmal. 

I think that systemic issues which began with racism have become something greater. In America, our national conceit is that we have class, and that is true to a certain extent. If you make money in America, become a taxpayer, you'll join the middle class, no questions. But we are developing an urban underclass. It began with white flight in the late 1960s, but it expanded to the flight of the black middle class from Baltimore. Schools talked about as indecent in The Corner, written 30 years ago, like Frederick Douglas High and Mergenthaler High still have failing test scores. 

The cities poor. Its elected leadership is of low quality (Jesus lord almighty, a non corrupt, empathetic but competent mayor is this too much to ask?) The police might not know how to police anymore, though it seems they're trying a community based approach again. What started with racism and the War on Drugs has become something greater, as the police are 40% black, the mayor is black, and police leadership is black all in a 60% black city. Those folks in the drug trade, even if they leave the drug trade, what do they do? How're they gonna find a job in Baltimore? Who's crazy enough to start a company in Baltimore? No outsider will, the city schools are terrible. The city is basically a giant rust belt city. The contraction is easy to understand. Voting with your feet is on the purest forms of democracy, and folks are leaving.

Anyways, I have no solutions. I say we end the war on drugs and see where that leads. Try to invest and gentrify the city (the city needs more tax money!), but provide vouchers for the residents so they don't get priced out. That homicide count is unbelievable and must be stopped. Further, if the homicide rate is this high, homicides being one of the few crime stats which can't be skewed, violent crime in general must be up.

The question is whether or not they can replace him with a person of their choosing. [28 U.S. Code § 546](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/546) does not appear to preclude naming a replacement, but under the [Federal Vacancies Reform Act](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44997.pdf), the president can designate acting officials only in the event that the serving official ""dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office"".  There's a debate about what that language means, but at least one plausible interpretation is that it does not apply in the case of *firing* (firing is not resignation and being fired doesn't appear to make you ""unable"" to perform the job).

In short, firing Berman (rather than having him resign) opens up some legal risk for the government.  It's often hard to challenge the legality of a government appointment, but in the case of a US Attorney, it's really easy.  Any criminal defendant in the Southern District would have standing to challenge Berman's replacement's appointment, and if a court ruled in their favor, it could upset every criminal prosecution currently in progress there, so they really want him to resign rather have to fire him.

>Berman *can* be replaced by a Senate-confirmed successor.

>**Not clear:**

>Whether *Trump* can fire Berman.

>Whether Barr/Trump can name his replacement *without* 
Senate confirmation.

>*WHY* this happened.

So let's break it down:

**Attorney General Bill Barr lied.**

This can be deduced basically from reading [Barr's](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-nomination-jay-clayton-serve-us-attorney-southern-district) and [Berman's](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/statement-us-attorney-geoffrey-s-berman-announcement-attorney-general-barr) statements.  Barr saying Berman ""stepped down"" is flatly and explicitly contradicted by Berman, and isn't something you'd include by mistake.  Further, press reports are that [Barr tried to offer Berman a promotion to head of the civil division, and Berman declined](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-administration-replaces-manhattan-us-attorney/2020/06/19/acae9348-b298-11ea-8758-bfd1d045525a_story.html) so Barr affirmatively knew Berman wasn't planning on leaving voluntarily.

**Something really stinks.**

This is an inference from a couple of things.  First and foremost, Berman's going nuclear on Barr and holding the line on keeping his job.  This doesn't make sense from just a personal career advancement standpoint, since he was offered a better job.  It also comes from Barr's haste in trying to push Berman out.  Berman's own statement acknowledges he is out the moment the Senate confirms a nominee to his post.  If Barr and Trump had just waited for the Senate to confirm a nominee to USAO-SDNY, Berman would be gone with no muss or fuss. The fact that they sought to push him out right now, and lied about it, strongly implies they needed him out now for some reason, probably something bad.

**Legally, Barr can't fire Berman.**

The Attorney General has no statutory authority to fire US Attorneys.  [The statute vests appointment and dismissal power normally with the President.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/541) or in the case of this vacancy, appointment with (and perhaps dismissal by) the [US District Court.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/546)  But definitely not the Attorney General.

**Berman can be replaced by a Senate-confirmed successor.**

As Berman acknowledges and as Sec. 546 linked above provides, a Senate confirmed US Attorney is the gold standard, and if the Senate confirmed a nominee to the post, Berman would be out.

Now moving on to the world of the not clear...

**Whether Trump can fire Berman.**

There is a pretty direct conflict between two statutes.  [28 USC Sec. 541](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/541) and [Sec 546.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/546)

Sec. 541 says:

>(c)Each United States attorney is subject to removal by the President.

Sec. 546 says:

>(a)Except as provided in subsection (b), the Attorney General may appoint a United States attorney for the district in which the office of United States attorney is vacant.

>(c)A person appointed as United States attorney under this section may serve until the earlier of—


>>(1)the qualification of a United States attorney for such district appointed by the President under section 541 of this title; or


>>(2)the expiration of 120 days after appointment by the Attorney General under this section.

>(d)If an appointment expires under subsection (c)(2), the district court for such district may appoint a United States attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled. The order of appointment by the court shall be filed with the clerk of the court.

Thats a bit of a wall of text but the key is that Berman was appointed by the court because 120 days of vacancy expired, and the statute says that a court-appointed US Attorney is ""to serve until the vacancy is filled.""

The First Circuit [remarked in a case from the 1990s](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-hilario) that it appeared the President (but not the AG) had the power to remove a court-appointed US Attorney, though the President had not done so, and the case was just affirming that court appointed US Attorneys are generally lawful.  So *probably* Trump can fire Berman, but he would need to do it himself, explicitly, and it's not a total slam dunk because no court ever really tested it.

**Whether Barr/Trump can name his replacement without Senate confirmation.**

One important note of Barr's press release is that it purports to name Craig Carpenito of USAO-NJ to be acting SDNY US Attorney.  No authority for that move is cited, and I think it probably is unlawful.  Even if the President can fire Berman, I think under Sec. 546, the court would appoint a new interim US Attorney.  The statute says the court appointment runs ""until the vacancy is filled"" and I think the better reading of the statute is that the court retains appointment power to fill a secondary vacancy until the original vacancy of the Senate-confirmed US Attorney is resolved.  Of course, this has also never been tested in a court before.

**WHY this happened.**

We are left to speculate as to why this move happened, though the conduct of all parties involved suggests it's a pretty bad reason.  This was a quite public move involving a clumsy lie to push out Berman 5 months before an election when a couple months' patience would have pushed him out quietly and effectively.  In response, Berman went absolutely nuclear, and effectively called the Attorney General of the United States a liar, while making a pointed remark that ""our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption.""  That remark (with no parallel remark about e.g. ongoing cases or litigation) strongly implies that the reason for this was to kill an investigation that Trump and/or Barr wanted killed. But we do not yet know for sure.",huadpe,,hch55v,fvfzkxn
,"The one sure way to replace a US Attorney is for the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm a new one, [the normal way they are appointed](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/541). But there's a political question, rather than a legal one, about whether that Senate confirmation could actually happen.

The specific person Barr's press release named as the ultimate replacement, Jay Clayton, [has never been a prosecutor](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/justice-department-replaces-federal-prosecutor-berman-with-sec-clayton.html), making him a bizarrely inappropriate choice to be the top prosecutor in one of the country's most influential districts. Specifically that district, [the Southern District of New York (SDNY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York), covers Manhattan and is therefore a major venue for the prosecution of financial crimes. That's awkward for Clayton because before becoming a civil servant [he was a private lawyer for numerous financial firms](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/sec-nominee-jay-clayton-client-list-conflicts-interest.html), which might raise even more fox-in-the-henhouse concern as a prosecutor than it did as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Furthermore, one of Clayton's former clients, the [notorious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank#Controversies) Deutsche Bank, was the target of [an SDNY investigation](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/politics/justice-department-investigation-russian-laundering-deutsche-bank/index.html) for laundering $10 billion in an organized ""mirror trading"" scheme on behalf of Russian oligarchs, while it was represented by Clayton. Deutsche Bank is also notable for is [long and problematic history](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/business/deutsche-bank-donald-trump.html) as the lender for Donald Trump, and [reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/business/deutsche-bank-trump-kushner.html) failed to disclose suspicious transactions with both the president and his senior advisor/son-in-law. Another of Deutsche Bank's clients connected to the president was the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, [who had his own suspicious transactions](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/business/jeffrey-epstein-deutsche-bank.html), and who was also the target of an SDNY [prosecution](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors) that is still leading to [ongoing SDNY investigations of Epstein's associates](https://news.yahoo.com/us-prosecutors-reject-claim-prince-andrew-cooperating-epstein-212937351.html).

SDNY may be pursuing several other Trump-related investigations, including [possible fraud, laundering, and campaign-finance violations by the 2016 inaugural committee](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/04/politics/sdny-subpoena-trump-inauguration-committee/index.html), a possible history of financial irregularities in the president's businesses [disclosed to SDNY by his former lawyer Michael Cohen](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/us/politics/michael-cohen-prosecutors-trump-organization.html), and his current lawyer Rudy Giuliani's possible role in [a Ukrainian-American campaign-finance fraud scheme](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-giuliani/u-s-prosecutors-seek-information-on-payments-to-trump-lawyer-giuliani-subpoena-idUSKBN1XZ2GZ).

EDIT: Aside from the president, a Clayton nomination hearing could also open the floor to concerns about Attorney General Bill Barr. [Among several other controversies](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/15/politics/william-barr-roger-stone-prosecutors-outrage/index.html), Barr has reportedly tried to micromanage certain cases but Berman has pushed back, particularly when Barr tried to negotiate a settlement with the state-owned Turkish bank Halkbank (after Turkey's president put pressure on the US's president) and Berman insisted on continuing criminal prosecution. The Halkbank case was already in the news this week as John Bolton's forthcoming memoir [says](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/18/john-bolton-urged-to-elaborate-on-trump-erdogan-claims) that in response to the Turkish president's pressure, ""Trump then told Erdoğan he would take care of things, explaining that the [New York] southern district prosecutors were not his people but were Obama people, a problem that would be fixed when they were replaced by his people.""

So if the president really does nominate Clayton as the new USA-SDNY, the Senate confirmation hearing could be a circus, with so many huge controversies to discuss. Given an election five months away, both the White House and the Senate Republicans might have qualms about opening that can of worms.",Epistaxis,,hch55v,fvfwsa0
,"It's hard to say.  As you point out, at will employment laws allow employers to fire employees at any time, and employment laws only really protect against being *openly* fired for membership in a protected class.

Most employment discrimination claims are handled by the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/overview) handles most employment discrimination claims.  Ultimately, these rarely lead to litigation.  Last year, the EEOC received 72,765 [complaints](https://www.eeoc.gov/enforcement/charge-statistics-charges-filed-eeoc-fy-1997-through-fy-2019) and filed [157](https://www.eeoc.gov/enforcement/eeoc-litigation-statistics-fy-1997-through-fy-2019) lawsuits. The vast majority of cases are adjudicated in favor of the employer.   Taking the subset of Title VII claims, the EEOC resolved [57,285 claims](https://www.eeoc.gov/enforcement/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964-charges-charges-filed-eeoc-includes-concurrent-charges) last year -- 85% of those closures were either administrative (EEOC closed the case) or were resolved as ""no reasonable cause"" (EEOC ruled against the claim of discrimination).  So, winning a case is definitely an uphill battle.

The social scientific record of employment law is not strong.  [Acemoglu and Angrist](https://economics.mit.edu/files/17#:~:text=Although%20the%20ADA%20was%20meant,the%20ADA%20went%20into%20effect) look at the effects of prohibiting employment discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which added non-discrimination protections for disabled individuals. Long story short, they find that this actually *reduced* employment among disabled individuals and had no effect on firings.

[Kalev and Dobbin](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/kalev_dobbin_2006.pdf) find modest but positive effects of discrimination lawsuits on employment prospects overall.  [Nielsen, Nelson, and Lancaster](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01175.x?casa_token=42Lsg4X1KnkAAAAA%3AowI6ggl1SnWvpdX8eDb-KKqUU8EY7qdg0cLuk6wTUWM5fycEikEtk0OUgiSe9TaNEUC7EJuHf4Md) argue, based on empirical research, that ""employment discrimination litigation consists overwhelmingly of individual cases, a majority of which end in a small settlement...while not providing a significant remedy.""

I'm broadening beyond ""rulings"" here because most of the action is legislative, but basically, the pattern is clear.  Non-discrimination provisions don't work very well.   My own speculation is that this is basically because discrimination is so hard to prove.  I imagine that some particular individuals will be vindicated by the present ruling but that the overall effects on the labor market will not be substantial.

Edit: /u/deadzip10 points out that workers who fail to obtain relief through the EEOC are permitted to sue on their own to pursue their claim.  As such, looking only at the EEOC data understates how often employees obtain relief.

The vast majority of employees do not sue on their own.  The most recent data I can find is for 2015-2016, in which 7,239 out of 81,129 workers sued (9%).  Of that 9%, the worker won in 1% of cases (i.e., 0.09% of workers with right to sue actually sued and won).  The employer won in 14% of cases, 7% were resolved procedurally (usually in favor of the employer) and the remainder probably settled.

It's inherently hard to get data on settlements because they're confidential, but [Kotkin](http://law2.wlu.edu/deptimages/Law%20Review/64-1%20Kotkin%20Article.pdf) studies a sample of employment discrimination lawsuits and finds that these settlements are usually for money (not reinstatement) and usually really small - median $30k, mean $54k.  The majority of settlements give the worker *less* than the amount of back pay at stake with the sole exception of sexual harassment lawsuits settlements that result in a bit more to the worker.  

In short, out of the tens of thousands of discrimination claims filed, perhaps a few thousand workers win a small cash settlement that doesn't even make up for the wages they lost.  As Kotkin notes, public perception tends to be dominated the the tiny fraction of cases leading to a large jury award, but this is not representative of the overall pattern.",chadtr5,,haa1o7,fv1xp00
,"On mobile, so please forgive my brevity.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, from which this decision comes, actually lists out the protected classes.   Cases where ""who qualifies as part of a protected class"" aren't all that common given the relative clarity of the statute.

One case that did address this issue previously was G.E. v. Gilbert.  The issue there was whether discrimination on the basis of pregnancy qualified as discrimination on the basis of sex.  The plaintiff lost that case, which prompted Congress to amend the Civil Rights Act to include pregnancy.  You saw something similar with the Lily Ledbetter Act, although her case is not of the type you're asking about.

Can wins have a major impact?  Yes, absolutely.
One of the first major Supreme Court opinions to address this was McDonnell Douglas v. Green.  This case had a major impact, as it laid out the elements of what the burden of proof is in an employment discrimination case.  The decision made it easier for plaintiffs to actually win their case.  It is still cited with significant frequency in employment discrimination cases of all types.  

That having been said, employment discrimination cases are a lot harder to win these days, because employers aren't as blatantly racist as they were back in the 70's.  As you noted, almost all states allow you to fire someone for any non-discriminatory reason or no reason at all.  It's still up to the plaintiff to show pretext and that isn't easy if the discrimination is subtle (or even sometimes when it's not subtle, if you've got a bad jury/unsympathetic plaintiff/whatever). 

Will this case prompt more suits and more victories?  I suspect that initially it will, but that will start to fade as homosexuality becomes more accepted by society and the prevailing discrimination shifts from outright slurs to more systemic forms.

,"Retail rates are either set by state commissions, or by the market through exchanges. Wholesale markets are always regulated by the Federal Government.  

The state commissions, where they exist, play an active role in setting retail rates, historically as a return on invested capital. This, of course, incentivized massive capital expenditures by the private energy producers, notwithstanding that the commissions were supposed to gauge the appropriateness and need for new facilities. After suffering from massive over-commitment, many states moved to deregulate energy production. The Federal Government supported this by allowing the creation of regional energy trading nodes. In those states, typically states merely permit energy projects based on normal construction regulations. No finding of need required. In those states, producers offer their energy wholesale to energy traders at daily auctions. The energy traders typically have signed long term agreements with local utilities and profit off of the difference. It's the utilities that then determine the retail rate.

In states that have them, commissions weild enormous power. For example, the Commission in Missouri blocked the siting of high voltage direct current lines that were intended to move wind energy to eastern markets. Similarly, Arizona blocked the siting of high voltage lines to California because the increase in demand would raise prices on Arizona consumers.

So what's better? Honestly, no one knows. \[Here\]( [https://www.utilitydive.com/news/appa-deregulation-has-not-achieved-intended-results/555566/](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/appa-deregulation-has-not-achieved-intended-results/555566/) ) is a more nuanced answer. 

&#x200B;

I have never seen anyone find that the method of selecting the utility commissioners matters. Commissioners are only one of many, many, many bodies that regulate the energy market. So while it's conceivable that there was regulatory capture that led to some places having higher prices than others, I haven't seen any credible suggestions that it happened.",AlaskaManiac,,ha8vwh,fv2qidv
,"Basically every utility commission in the United States functions the same way as to rates because they are all governed by very old SCOTUS cases. [Here's](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1286&context=clr) an old law review article talking about these old cases.  The idea of these cases is that a utility commission may set rates that allow for a 'just and reasonable' rate of return, and are non-confiscatory.  This is derived from law on eminent domain.  You must allow for a just and reasonable rate of return, otherwise you are taking private property without just compensation to the shareholder owned utility.

Most if not all states have a utility commission.  But not all states set them up in exactly the same way.  The two biggest utility types that have their retail rates governed by utility commissions are water and electricity, with natural gas retail service coming in third (mainly because it has primarily proliferated recently).  Some states have energy and water regulated by the same commission others have them regulated by different commissions.  Ultimately, the ""just and reasonable"" rate legal standard is what maintains utility profit margins and acts as upward pressure on rates.

As a whole, [real energy rates](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.php?t=ptb0810) have been pretty stable over time.  [This is a real time data portal](https://www.misoenergy.org/markets-and-operations/real-time--market-data/real-time-displays/) for MISO (a regional electricity system), the hotspots you see on this map indicate Locational Marginal Prices (or LMP) which are higher than the surrounding area.  These are wholesale prices. This is probably mostly because of inadequate transmission into this area of higher demand.  [Here](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/10/f38/water_wastewater_escalation_rate_study.pdf) is a report for water and wastewater rates over the last decade (2008-2017). As you can see, rate increases can deviate significantly even within states that have the same commission structure.

I find it doubtful that internal organization has any major impact on utility rates.  Whether rates are 'just and reasonable' is almost always reviewable by courts, and while courts are typically deferential to utility regulators, especially in the ratemaking context, anything out of the ordinary can be checked.  It's more likely that larger effects on ratemaking are governed by resource adequacy, and political forces, rather than internal organization.  Electric prices (which are probably the most data rich of all the utilities) vary greatly from region to region and even within regions based on several factors, lack of adequate transmission, generation capabilities, demand, which play a much larger role in determining a retail rate than internal organization, probably.  

Here is a [guide to utility ratemaking](http://www.puc.pa.gov/General/publications_reports/pdf/Ratemaking_Guide2018.pdf) in Pennsylvania which is PA focused, but as I described earlier, basically all utility commissions work roughly the same.  There is also a national organization of utility ratemaking bodies, NARUC, which you may be interested in reading about.",triangle60,,ha8vwh,fv3bslu

,"America's worldwide influence is a vague term that's somewhat observable in the world but hard to fully take an account of. It's also subjective, so one person's opinion on rising/falling influence is often informed by their own politics and biases, rather than an objective standard.

One of the recurring themes in the articles that you cited is that US hegemony in culture, economy, and military is in decline. As is pointed out in at least two of those, this was mostly possible because WW2 and the Cold War only left behind one superpower. As China, India, and other countries develop, it's impossible to believe that the US (and Europe) will maintain the same level of influence without some sort of major economic breakthrough or kneecapping of the rising powers. Because of this, I don't think there's any ""restoration"" of US influence to what it was in the 1990s.

At the same time, it's not clear what the best way is to improve the influence of the US. Many liberal/left writers and politicians believe that increased involvement in multilateral international organizations would do this. [This article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/05/china-global-influence-who-united-states/611227/) outlines some ways that China is using the UN to further its agenda, including the fact that Chinese nationals head 4 of the 15 specialized agencies. Likewise, China pushed an amendment saying ""that human rights need to be balanced by economic growth"" in the UN Human Rights Commission, which is an agency the U.S. isn't even a part of. The Trump administration, for its part, generally seems to view organizations like the UN as irrelevant. The US could arguably increase its influence by being more active in the UN (like China is), but obviously Trump and others believe that the US is sufficiently influential outside the UN and that increasing activity in the UN would be superfluous. The failings of the WHO during the COVID pandemic make me skeptical that the US shouldn't be more involved in the organization, but it's hard to say what more direct action by the US would accomplish.

The point here is that the US already enjoys more influence in the world than any other country, but this influence is declining because the world is changing in really fundamental ways. It turns out I don't really have an answer for your question, but I encourage you to be more cynical about what constitutes influence as you continue research.",luigi_itsa,,gxuiw8,fteugg1

This simply did not matter to the US then, because those two countries were the US's primary buffers to contain communism in east Asia.  'Communism' in this instance is not what Marx espoused, but rather what Stalin espoused, which was global revolution, a threat to all capitalist nations including the US.

>sanctions on Burundian officials following **violence that was committed against protesters by the police and security forces**

In response to eg. banning something as generally applicable (can't easily prove/disprove whether someone is a member) as similar to in the current US case ""Antifa""

Sadly, they aren't always inclined to react against ""allied"" regimes.

>The extra-judicial killing, torture, abduction and physical abuse of journalists are clearly matters justifying the imposition of sanctions under the ‘Magnitsky’ legislation passed in the US, UK and Canada, and targeted sanctions have been imposed on that basis by the US and Canada. The legislation in each of these countries is also broad enough to encompass the arbitrary detention of journalists,  It is unclear whether sanctions can be imposed in response to other forms of degrading treatment of journalists, such as the filing of frivolous lawsuits, online harassment or surveillance. But **any attacks against journalists should justify the imposition of sanctions if they amount to ‘gross violations of human rights’** in the Canadian regime, ‘serious human rights abuses’ under the Magnitsky laws in the US, or, in the UK, if they fall within one of the broader purposes recognised in the Sanctions Act.

,"Twitter/ticktock are not a good source for legal advice. I’m in NYC, and if you walk up to a cop, s/he is under *zero* obligation to give you a badge number. Cops frequently cover them as a sign of general solidarity and unity (note: reasonable people can disagree of this is a good thing). 

In NYC this is covered by the ‘right to know act’:

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/complaints/right-to-know-act.page

In practice it works like this: you do not have the right to unilaterally demand to know a cops ID and/or badge number. However, if a cop instigates an ‘investigation’, then you have a ‘right to know’ who you are dealing with. NYPD carries ID cards with name, badge, precinct, etc on them, and you can demand one. This is basically all you need to file a complaint. 

What is an investigation? It’s basically the point where a cop ‘arrests’ your path (HUGE NOTE: ‘arrest’ has a legal definition and of does not *necessarily* mean handcuffs. It means more like “interrupting your normal course of actions.” Due to television, the meanings of ‘arrest’ and ‘detain’ get mixed all the time). 

So if a cop stops and asks you a question, that *is not* an investigation bc you can just walk away; in this case, you *cannot* demand an ID card. However, if you walk away and the cop comes and grabs your shoulder, demands ID and searches your person, you are now being investigated and can demand his/her ID. (SECOND NOTE: there is a huge grey area in the middle and this gets litigated in court every day.  Sometimes prosecution wins and sometimes defense wins). I know that sounds like splitting hairs, but 99% of ‘the law’ is splitting hairs.",Laminar_flo,,gwphg9,fsy0kr6
,"From your article (about Seattle):

> uniform codes only require a last name and first initial to be displayed

So it appears that obstructing badge numbers is legal there. And according to the article, the practice in Seattle is called ""mourning badges"", in honor of police who died in the line of duty - though the article notes that hasn't happened in Seattle in over a decade, and there are officially approved mourning badges that don't obscure the badge number.

In contrast, [New York City](https://theintercept.com/2020/06/03/nypd-badge-black-band/): the NYPD Patrol Guide specifically prohibits mourning badges from obscuring the badge number or rank, which is strictly required to be visible, yet as the article says, the practice appears to be widespread there too. However, the [letter threatening a lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6936059-National-Lawyers-Guild-Letter-to-NYPD.html) from the National Lawyers Guild does not cite any formal statute that this practice violates, beyond the NYPD Patrol Guide; it only points to the Supreme Court case [Monell v. Department of Soc. Svcs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monell_v._Department_of_Social_Services_of_the_City_of_New_York) IANAL but my reading is that this case says nothing about concealing badge numbers in particular, but rather it would (in the NLG's argument) simply allow them to sue a municipal police department for violating its own rules even though those rules are not strictly the law. That seems like it should apply, but it may depend on getting a court to interpret a police field manual, and it only enables lawsuits - which require the plaintiff to have standing, on the basis that their rights were violated. Who would be the plaintiff? Any protester or journalist (exercising First Amendment rights)? Protesters or journalists who were arrested by improperly attired police? The Civil Rights Division of the federal Department of Justice? Again, IANAL, but a lawyer might be able to tell you whether Monell has been successfully used for this purpose in the past.

But go back to that last plaintiff: the DOJ Civil Rights Division has an existing format for a [""pattern or practice"" investigation](https://www.justice.gov/file/how-pp-investigations-work/download), wherein they examine the overall activities of e.g. a municipal police department for problems like excessive force or discrimination. If it finds these problems, the DOJ can enforce a remedy through a consent decree, i.e. the DOJ and the police settle on a list of changes the police must make and a judge supervises their compliance. That's a tried-and-true mechanism for police reform except for three current problems:

1. [under the previous Attorney General, the DOJ greatly scaled back its use of consent decrees for civil-rights cases](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-rolls-back-civil-rights-efforts-federal-government);
1. [the current Attorney General does not seem to have prioritized protecting civil rights at protests](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/barr-personally-ordered-removal-of-protesters-near-white-house-leading-to-use-of-force-against-largely-peaceful-crowd/2020/06/02/0ca2417c-a4d5-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html); and
1. the DOJ Civil Rights Division would mainly be interested in investigating patterns and practices that breach a specific statute or part of the Constitution, but it's not immediately clear which civil rights are at stake here - obviously with protesters and journalists we think of the First Amendment, but if you want to ban this practice during all police activity then you need something more general, and again I don't know whether Monell would fit (even in the places where this practice is actually against policy like New York rather than Seattle) or whether e.g. the Fourth Amendment could be interpreted that way.

So if there were a functional federal government, we might like to see Congress drafting some new, detailed legislation for nationwide regulation of police conduct. That would give the DOJ Civil Rights Division exactly what it needs to crack down on this kind of behavior, and put it at a strong advantage for consent decrees (which come through negotiation, after all).

Realistically, it's probably up to state or local governments. But in my opinion it would still be preferable for enforcement, if not legislation, to be done at the state level in a manner analogous to DOJ Civil Rights. A huge part of the problem with police unaccountability is that district attorneys who need to investigate police are in an extremely conflicted position, because the police are their everyday partners in ordinary law enforcement (and [campaign donors and endorsers](https://news.yahoo.com/editorial-heres-hold-police-accountable-100017068.html)).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - 

With cities across America in turmoil over the death of George Floyd, a U.S. lawmaker plans to introduce legislation this week that he hopes will end a pattern of police violence by allowing victims to sue officers for illegal and unconstitutional acts.

U.S. Representative Justin Amash, a conservative independent from Michigan, won support from a Minneapolis Democrat on Monday for his “Ending Qualified Immunity Act,” which would allow civil lawsuits against police, a recourse that the Supreme Court has all but done away with.

The high court's adoptihere of the qualified immunity doctrine has largely shielded police from financial settlements for victims or grieving families. The doctrine protects cops even when courts determine that officers violate civil rights, a Reuters investigation showed here

“The brutal killing of George Floyd is merely the latest in a long line of incidents of egregious police misconduct,” Amash told colleagues in a letter. “This pattern continues because police are legally, politically and culturally insulated ... That must change so that these incidents stop happening.”

A black man, Floyd died a week ago after pleading for his life as a white Minneapolis policeman kneeled on his neck. Protesters angered by his death and by racial inequities have demonstrated for six straight nights.

Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat, intends to back the bill, according to an aide. Amash aims to introduce it on Thursday. It was unclear whether the legislation would gain support from the Congressional Black Caucus.

The bill joins a flurry of Democratic legislation in the House of Representatives and Senate. Democratic senators have pledged to introduce separate measures that would create a national registry for police misconduct and stop the transfer of military weaponry to local police departments.

“Be sure of this. We will propose and push for bold action,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday.

Republicans have condemned Floyd’s killing and voiced support for peaceful protests, but have largely steered clear of criticizing or echoing President Donald Trump’s harsh rhetoric toward violent protesters.

Republican Senator Tom Cotton tweeted that Trump should use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces to cities to “ensure this violence ends tonight.”

,"Unfortunately not all shootings are tracked and reported.  But of the ones that are, police shoot more white people than they do black people.  So far in 2020, they have shot 42 white people, 31 black people, and 16 Hispanic people.

But the US is 60% white, 13% black, and 18% latino/Hispanic. 

[Source](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219)


So while more white people are killed in total, black people are overrepresented by percentage.


However, studies suggesr that racism from officers is not a significant driver of that disparity.  
""We find no evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings, and White officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-White officers,"" the authors wrote.

Because of this, the efforts of promoting more diversity have not had any impact on police shootings.  Black cops are just as likely to shoot as white cops (same source as above) 


""In areas with high rates of violent crime by blacks, police were more than three times more likely to shoot dead a black person than a white person, the study found.
But the reverse was also true, with white people more likely to be shot by police in places where whites committed many crimes, the study found."". (same source)

So what the evidence above shows us is that poverty leads to crime and crime leads to more police patrols, and more police patrols lead to more use of force cases with police. 


This, in My opinion, is why we keep spinning our wheels on this issue.  The primary driver is not race, but *poverty*.  And no amount of police procedural changes will address poverty. 


When police are working in low crime areas, they have less interactions with the public and tensions are much lower, greatly reducing the opportunity for error.",B0h1c4,,gu41wc,fsj0ilp
,"Initially, I'm interested in the premise that you establish off the bat. The first claim is that ""**Reports suggest that police use of lethal force against minorities in the U.S. is higher than their white counterparts,""** and you reference several news articles and studies. Personally, I'm not particularly interested in the interpretation of studies by news or media outlets, since they are not the primary source of facts or statistics; the studies themselves are. Thus I will be addressing the studies referenced in the last paragraph. 

The first study referenced from PNAS concludes that race is a factor in lifetime risk of lethal police shooting. This data is calculated based on national averages, and

> Because we lack sufficient data to track a birth cohort over the life course, we rely on synthetic cohorts to estimate lifetime risk 

In [another study](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877/tab-article-info) by from PNAS in the same year, it was concluded that police shootings can largely be tied to area-specific crime demographics. It conducted its research in an attempt to take into account the race of the officers involved in shootings under the assumption that fatal shootings performed by an officer of the same race as the victim were not racially motivated. It additionally concluded that

> We find no evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings 

and

 > As the proportion of White officers in a fatal officer-involved shooting increased, a person fatally shot was not more likely to be of a racial minority.  
as per a correction to the significance statements of the initial study that can be found [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/16/9127). 

Finally I would like to reference [this statistical analysis](https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force) done by Harvard professor Roland G Fryer, Jr. that concluded while people of color were more likely to be victims of police action generally (e.g. being touched, handcuffed, and pushed to the ground) there is no disparity in police shootings. Fryer states

>In the end, however, without randomly assigning race, we have no definitive proof of discrimination. 

I would like to note the significance of the specifics here, however. More recent cases of police brutality that have sparked protests have often resulted in death from use of techniques that don't involve shooting. I would assume that this conversation began as a result of the national discussion sparked by the death of George Floyd (though I could be wrong), and his case was that of a fatality caused by the type of treatment that Fryer notes people of color ARE more likely to be victims of. 

 [This data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-21) from the FBI demonstrates that based off of the amount of the population made up of people of color, they are arrested at disproportionately higher rates in comparison with white persons. 

I suppose I'd like to pose the following question: While it can indeed be shown that there is a racial disparity in arrests and general treatment by police, is this necessarily true when it comes to *lethal force*, as suggested by your claim? Additionally, can we conclude that this disparity is a direct result of the factor of race (i.e. are the arrests/shootings/uses of force racially motivated in nature)? I would argue based off of the data I referenced that this is not the case. Why, then, does the data show such a strong correlation between being a person of color and the likelihood of being a victim of police action? Based off of the PNAS article that I referenced, the answer may lie with area-specific crime demographics. 

It is commonly accepted as fact that poverty-stricken areas experience higher rates of crime than non poverty-stricken areas (nonetheless, here is [data](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=5508484140a84023a1e2d8b080e14d0a) to support this). It is additionally commonly accepted that there is a racial wealth divide, where a higher percentage of black families are impoverished in comparison with white families ([data](https://inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/#racial-wealth-divide)). So, then, do we see this correlation between being a person of color and police action due to the fact that a higher percentage of people of color live in poverty-stricken areas, and are therefore more likely to be involved in (or assumed to be involved in by police) crime? 

I would like to conclude by addressing your question about policy. I don't think that policy involving the reformation of police systems is particularly effective in reducing the racial disparity discussed here.  A study referenced by /u/surreptitioussloth below suggests that changes to police training are largely ineffective in this area. I instead think that an argument can be made that past racism in the US and a lack of resources dedicated to benefiting freed slaves (and reparations following the abolishing of Jim Crowe laws) contributed to the poverty experienced by contemporary people of color, and this is instead to blame for the disparity in their treatment by police. If policy were to be focused on community outreach and lifting people of color out of poverty, I would argue that we would likely see some equalization in their treatment by police. 

I would of course encourage anyone reading this to check the sources I referenced; if any of my conclusions appear to be inaccurately drawn from the data I'd be happy to have that pointed out. I would love for there to be simpler, police-focused policy changes that could address this problem directly, I just am unsure that the answer is that simple.

,"Here’s my input, hasn’t been tried yet but perhaps has the chance to be the most effective: SUE DIRTY COPS EN MASSE AND FORCE THE SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW QUALIFIED IMMUNITY DOCTRINE!

Unfortunately, as the law currently stands, qualified immunity doctrine makes it virtually impossible to succeed in civil lawsuits against police officers acting in the line of duty. Given the amount of interest around the country there is in police misconduct right now, I think it is an excellent time to have a debate on this legal doctrine.

In order for anyone to successfully sue a cop, there must be “clear precedent” relevant to the situation being litigated that places the illegality of the police’s conduct “...beyond debate” to “...every reasonable officer.” Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011).  https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-98. Essentially, if it can be argued that there might exist a single “reasonable officer” who wouldn’t know that there was clear court precedent in his jurisdiction judging the same alleged act to be illegal, then that is a complete defense to any civil lawsuit arising out of their conduct on duty. Period. Note how rapidly the Supreme Court’s analysis here changed in comparison with Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 US 388 (1971). https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/388.

Given that, in my general experience, police officers’ understanding of the nuances of Constitutional law tends to be tenuous at best, that ignorance actually serves to protect them. “I didn’t know that beating people’s faces in on their own property after talking back to me was against the law. I felt that I had a right to exercise force because they were “resisting”, (which in some jurisdictions *cough cough Florida*, can consist of as little as nonviolently refusing to comply with an officer’s instructions). “I’ve done this before and never been punished.” Can be a defense. “Someone else on the force did this and wasn’t punished” can be a defense.  I hope you are beginning to understand how problematic this is.

Mind you, this is all despite the fact that there is *federal legislation* enacted after the passage of the 13th and 14th Amendments that explicitly gives citizens the right to bring civil lawsuits against state and local government officials for violating their constitutional rights, namely, 42 USC Section 1983. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983. I really cannot stress that as far as federal legislation goes, it is hard to find anything that displays Congress’s intent as clearly as this law does. In relevant part it reads: 

“Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress[.]”

Despite Congress’s crystal clear intent for this law, which was, after all, primarily enacted *to allow black people to sue abusive officials* and enforce the Civil War Amendments, the Supreme Court has taken it upon itself to utterly eviscerate this legislation over the course of the last 4 decades, at least partially in the interest of protecting state and local governments from “nuisance lawsuits.”

The good news is that there have been recent comments from Supreme Court Justices on both the left and right in recent years stating that they might want to readdress qualified immunity doctrine and these protests might give them the kick up the ass to finally do so.

In order to make sure that the message is received, people NEED to be talking about this publicly. Chief Justice Roberts is very sensitive to public perception of the Supreme Court right now and if people make a big enough stink about this, I could see either him or perhaps Justice Thomas siding with the liberal wing to roll this back. Sotomayor has been railing against qualified immunity doctrine since the day she was confirmed, and Thomas has expressed concerns as well, so there is definitely an appetite in the Court to take this on if a good test case is able to work its way up to them. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/5275816002. See also, a study conducted by Reuters confirming statements from a 2018 Sotomayor dissent alleging that successful prosecutions against officers had substantially decreased since the introduction of post-1982 qualified immunity doctrine. https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-immunity-methodology/

To me, this is a HUGE part of the puzzle. It is EASY for a mayor or governor to secure the firing of an individual dirty cop without anything really changing, but just imagine how behavior would change if state and local governments or even individual officers knew that they could be **FINANCIALLY** on the hook for violating people’s Constitutional rights.",TheAluminumGuru,,gu41wc,fsho1i6

,"The draft order does several different things:

1. Instruct the FCC to issue new regulations relating to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act: I'll return to this.
2. Potentially restrict federal agencies from advertising on platforms judged to engage in ""viewpoint-based speech restrictions"" (the section heading here refers to a ""prohibition"" but the text actually just requests a review): Insofar as this is actually just a review, there's no real legal problem.
3. Create a report on bias in online platforms and recommend that the FTC consider appropriate action: Again, this doesn't actually do anything interesting although it could be the first step towards something else.
4. Establish a working group with state attorneys general on online bias: Again, this doesn't really do anything.

The action here is really on the first item.  The other three could end up going in a variety of directions but don't presently represent clear proposals to do anything with interesting legal implications.

So, let's focus on #1 which requires understanding what Section 230 does and why.  Keep in mind that Section 230 is a statute, so it cannot be modified by an executive order.  At most, an executive order can change (within reason) how executive agencies interpret a statute.

Section 230 immunity comes from [47 U.S. Code Section 230(c)(1)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230).  This reads in full:

>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

That probably sounds rather boring, but it's often been called ""[the twenty-six words that created the internet](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501714412/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet/).""  To understand why, we have to take a bit of a trip through libel and defamation law.  Eugene Volokh just published an [excellent summary](https://reason.com/2020/05/28/47-u-s-c-%c2%a7-230-and-the-publisher-distributor-platform-distinction/#more-8064439) on this topic, so I'll refer you there for a more detailed account.

In brief, prior to Section 230, there was a dispute about the level of responsibility held by an online platform for what someone else writes on said platform.  That is, if I post something defamatory on Reddit, then what is Reddit's responsibility for that content?  If Reddit is a publisher (like, say, a newspaper), then Reddit is responsible for the content and you can sue Reddit if I defame you via Reddit.  If, on the other hand, Reddit is merely a ""distributor"" or ""platform"" then they are not liable for what I say just because they happen to have transmitted it.

You can think of this as the difference between a newspaper and a news stand.  If a newspaper publishes a letter to the editor (from some random citizen), they assume some responsibility for its content (including defamatory content) because they vetted the letter and chose to publish it. On the other hand, the owner of the news stand that sells the newspaper probably didn't even read it, and isn't held responsible for the content.  The trucker that brings the newspaper from the printer to the news stand is even less responsible -- it would seem totally unreasonable to hold them liable here.

So, is a website more like the newspaper, the news stand, or the trucker? Before the Communications Decency Act, courts took the position that a website that did not exercise any editorial control was like a news stand -- not responsible for the content.  However, in [Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy Services](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/4540/export), the court held that a site that exercised *any* editorial control thereby became a publisher.  So, just censoring profanity or other fairly trivial content policies transformed you into a publisher, who was liable for defamation like a newspaper would be.

For an internet company, liability for defamation would be a business-ending catastrophe.  Reddit, Facebook, Twitter (none of these actually existed yet of course) would be exposed to a lawsuit any time anyone uses their site to defame someone else (which happens constantly).  They would be rapidly bankrupted.  Thus, the pre-CDA regime created a perverse incentive for companies not to moderate content at all so that they would be treated as distributors rather than publishers.  Censor our curse words to make you're site kid-friendly? Now you're liable for everything on your site.  Let people post horrifying torture porn without interfering? No liability.  It's a simple business decision to just allow people to do whatever they want (you still have to remove illegal content on request but that's a different issue).

So, Congress included Section 230 in the CDA for the purpose of making it safe for internet companies to moderate content without thereby exposing themselves to liability for what their users did.  In fact, the legal treatment was basically to give internet companies the level of immunity enjoyed by the trucker (rather than the news stand) in the example above.   There's a debate about whether this went too far in limiting internet company liability, but the alternative was to make it impossible for companies to moderate  anything.

Circling back around, certain conservatives believe that Facebook, Twitter, etc. have abused this regime by censoring speech on a political basis and that this ought to transform them into publishers (who are then liable for third party content on their sites like a newspaper would be).

Obviously, the President cannot change a law passed by Congress unilaterally, and that applies to the CDA.  The Executive Order envisions (I think this part gets too in the weeds to be interesting but see [my followup](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/gs8i90/is_there_any_legal_precedence_foragainst_a/fs788vv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) if you want to read more), however, a way of reinterpreting Section 230 such that platforms that remove content for certain reasons (including alleged political bias) would forfeit their Section 230 immunity.  This would be the death penalty for internet companies  -- even Facebook or Google's resources could not possibly survive the onslaught of defamation suits, so they would have to cave and stop moderating content.

That may sound like a big deal, but it's basically toothless.  The proposal is to do this via FCC rule-making, but Section 230 defends internet companies against *private* lawsuits.  If you attempt to sue Facebook for some content posted by a user, then Section 230 allows Facebook to get that lawsuit immediately dismissed.  The FCC is not part of that process, and an executive order doesn't get to change how courts interpret the law (if you're into this stuff, it's worth noting an interesting contrast in what Trump appears to be hoping for here and his administration's attitude towards Chevron deference but maybe no one else finds that amusing).

So, is there a precedent? Absolutely.  Trump wants to go back to the pre-CDA regime governing the internet.  Is it workable legally? No, not really. In this game of rock-paper-scissors, a statute beats an executive order.  Is this a big deal? Yes, but for a different reason.

I would guess that every lawyer and lobbyist for a tech company is currently quietly panicking, not because this executive order is itself threatening but because it might be the first shot in a broader war to change the legal regime governing the internet.

TL;DR: The order doesn't actually do anything, but laws sure are interesting.

,"What's the objective this advances?  I think there's an underlying philosophical issue here about the purpose of Social Security.

In any case, this would run into substantial trouble legally and politically.  If I understand you correctly, you want to pay out different levels of social security benefits on the basis of race and gender? At the moment, Social Security is [facially neutral](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/testing-facially-neutral-classifications-which-impact-on-minorities): it takes no account of such factors whether directly or indirectly.

On a legal level, I think transforming Social Security into a policy that explicitly discriminates on the basis of race and gender would be unconstitutional.

Probably the most on point case here is [City of Los Angeles Department of Water & Power v. Manhart](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/435/702/#tab-opinion-1952579).  Here, the Supreme Court took up a case involving a policy requiring female employees to contribute more to an employer pension plan than male employees on the basis that women live longer and would on average collect higher pension payout.  The Supreme Court held such a scheme was unlawful under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which forbids sex discrimination).  The court held that, although the policy was grounded in differential life expectancy, it was discriminatory because: ""Such a practice does not pass the simple test of whether the evidence shows treatment of a person in a manner which, but for that person's sex, would be different.""

That, of course, was a statutory case, not a constitutional one.  But, the Supreme Court has held that the fourteenth amendment *also* prohibits gender discrimination ([Reed v. Reed](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/404/71)) and racial discrimination ([Brown v. Board](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483)).   So, it's settled law that: gender/racial discrimination is unconstitutional and differential pension contributions based on gender are a form of gender discrimination (surely, the distinction between contributions there and pay outs in your proposal is irrelevant).  That makes it very difficult to claim that this policy is constitutional.  Certainly, it would trigger [strict scrutiny](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny) under judicial review -- so a court would require you to prove that a) the statute serves a compelling governmental interest (dubious) and b) the statue is narrowly tailored to do so (clearly not true of a race/gender based method).

It seems clear, then, that courts would strike down a plan to crudely pay out more based on race and gender.  Perhaps you could come up with a much more individualized scheme for assessing life expectancy based on health history and so on that would survive judicial scrutiny.  The politics are another matter entirely.  Social Security has often been called the ""[third rail](https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-social-security-medicare-20151027-column.html)"" of American politics -- touch it and die, and this would be a big change.

Edit: Given OP's other comments, I want to point out that a policy like this is caught between Scylla and Charybdis.  It's unconstitutional to base this on factors like race and gender.  There's no constitutional problem (though probably a big political one) with awarding early Social Security to those who have poor health behaviors, but then you create the mother of all perverse incentives.  You're actually encouraging people to do things that will kill them (e.g., take up smoking) so that they can retire early.",chadtr5,,grpawu,fs0gnyj
,"Interesting thought!

Would we also consider obesity as one of the factors?  That is, let obese people take social security earlier than the non-obese?  How about smokers?  Heroin users?  I assume we are not interested in those, but they lead to a potential ""con"" to the idea:

What if differing life expectancy between some of the groups you've named are due to different levels of risky behavior?  [Men drive faster than women and this contributes to their lower life expectancy.](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/gender) Should we award men, as a group, with earlier retirement benefits because, on average, they drive too fast?  What if one racial group has a higher percentage of smokers?

While some portion of life expectancy differences between groups may be determined by biology,  some portion also seems likely to be determined by choices.   Awarding people early retirement for making unhealthy decisions seems problematic.

Whats different about COVID-19 is that it effects more of us then other public health interventions and regulations in our living memory. Sure there have been past pandemics that we've dealt with but that isn't something we've experienced first hand. When measles was at its peak, ppl were well aware of the risk. Now with COVID-19 people don't have experiences to draw from and feel safe taking risk concerning lots of infectious disease. Ppl don't get vaccinated bc they can fight off these infections but it isn't a guarantee. A smoking ban is controversial but not many people smoke. I believe countries with the highest prevalence of smoking in asia like china is at a third of men smoke. What public health officials are suggesting is that everyone wears a mask. 

There's a lot of debate on the best way to implement these interventions. [Mandatory vaccination](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03642-w) is unpopular but it does increase the vaccination rate. However, ppl may just get an exemption but those can be more strict as well. It should be pointed out that many public health professionals are hesitant with this approach. Public health requires buy in from the community and collaboration. By being too punitive you risk losing trust, but the science is clear that large gatherings will inevitably lead to deaths and infection.",acort011,,grawe2,frzjiug
,"The European Molecular Biology Organization's peer-reviewed journal, [*EMBO Reports*](https://www.embopress.org/journal/14693178), published [*The continuing tensions between individual rights and public health*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2267241/pdf/7401134.pdf), which is a good overview. All of the quotes below are from the article (emphasis added); although the full paper is excellent, and I encourage you to read the whole thing if you are interested in this topic. 

&nbsp;

The history of tension between individual rights and public health goes back to the discovery of germ theory:

> Scientific advances in Europe during the nineteenth century, notably in the laboratories of Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) and Robert Koch (1843–1910), identified the causative agents of many infectious diseases. This ‘bacteriological revolution' transformed our understanding of how disease spreads and laid the foundations for a new public health ethos (Baldwin, 1999). **In this regard, it is worth noting that the discoveries of infectious bacteria by Pasteur and Koch provoked sharp resistance in those nations that were concerned about whether and how the imposition of quarantines would interrupt the free movement of goods and people** (Ackerknect, 1948).

> Early advocates of public health in the USA, such as Mitchell Prudden (1849–1924) and Hermann Biggs (1859–1923), who was general medical officer of the city of New York's (NY, USA) Department of Health in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, were unabashed as they defended the legitimacy of coercion in the face of public health threats. “[E]verything”, said Biggs when talking about efforts to curtail tuberculosis, “which is detrimental to health or dangerous to life, under the freest interpretation, is regarded as coming within the province of the Health Department. So broad is the construction of the law that everything which improperly or unnecessarily interferes with the comfort or enjoyment of life, as well as those things which are, strictly speaking, detrimental to health or dangerous to life, may become the subject of action on the part of the Board of Health.”

&nbsp;



> **US courts almost always deferred to public health authorities that have deprived individuals of their liberty in the name of public health**. One US state high court declared at the beginning of the twentieth century that, “[i]t is unquestionable that the legislature can confer police powers upon public officers for the protection of the public health. The maxim *Salus populi suprema lex* is the law of all courts in all countries. **The individual right sinks in the necessity to provide for the public good**” (Parmet, 1985). Even more remarkably, a plenary grant of authority was still found to be constitutional in the 1960s. In upholding the detention of a person with tuberculosis pursuant to a statute that provided virtually no procedural protections, a California appellate court declared in 1966 that, “[h]ealth regulations enacted by the state under its police power and providing even drastic measures for the elimination of disease...in a general way are not affected by constitutional provisions, either of the state or national government.”

...

> In the state of Massachusetts (USA), a smallpox epidemic during the winter of 1901 provided the occasion for a legal challenge to the state's compulsory vaccination law. This led to a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court in the case of Jacobson versus Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which established the government's right to use its ‘police powers' in order to control epidemic disease. In its seven-to-two decision, the Court affirmed the right of the people, through their elected representatives, to enact “health laws of every description to protect the common good”

> Efforts to impose quarantines on those viewed as a threat to public health has involved the use of measures that look excessive and profoundly unfair from the perspective of less troubled times. On several occasions, the outbreak of diseases among disfavoured minority groups has led to harsh measures being used against them. As Howard Markel noted in his book, *Quarantine!*, “[i]mmigrants arriving in New York City in 1892, for example, could be isolated and kept in squalid conditions to prevent the spread of cholera and typhus. At a time of massive immigration and concomitant nativist sentiment, health officials faced little popular opposition to their efforts”

&nbsp;

> **But is it true that there is no tension between public health and civil liberties**? Public health surveillance for both infectious and non-infectious diseases is crucial in order to understand the patterns of diseases, and for the planning and execution of remedial action. This is true for tuberculosis, as it is true for cancer (Fairchild et al, 2007). Surveillance, to be effective, necessitates that either physicians or laboratories comply with public health mandates that clearly intrude on privacy. Only if we acknowledge this fact can we determine whether the public health benefits of surveillance justify this price.

> Mandatory immunization of school children clearly intrudes on or burdens parental autonomy. Yet, both the protection of children from infectious disease and the ensuing ‘herd immunity' by high-level vaccination coverage, which protects those who cannot be vaccinated, depend on such mandates. Various outbreaks of measles and pertussis (whooping cough) underscore the toll that we have to pay when we privilege parental choice; it might be a cost worth bearing but we will only know if we are forced to acknowledge the trade-offs involved.

> Another central tenet of public health is the requirement that people with certain diseases undergo treatment—as in the case of tuberculosis—or that people with highly infectious diseases be isolated or quarantined. Such measures always require that we address questions of whether the health threats, their severity and transmissibility all justify depriving individuals of their liberty. These questions cannot be answered without confronting the tension between the interests of the individual and those of the collective. **If SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) taught us anything, it was how difficult it is to make such decisions in the face of uncertainty. It might turn out in retrospect that the quarantines we impose when faced with a potential epidemic are more extensive than necessary. But in the face of an evolving threat, public health officials have no choice but to weigh personal liberty against potential grave threats**


&nbsp;


> At stake here is the question of paternalism. Is it appropriate for the State to impose restrictions on competent adults in order to protect them from harming themselves? Those who are inspired by the tradition of John Stuart Mill answer with a resounding ‘No'. They claim that public health officials can educate and warn, but not compel.

...

> During the 1970s, pressure by the federal government in the USA led virtually all states to mandate the use of motorcycle helmets (Jones & Bayer, 2007). These statutes provoked the wrath of motorcyclists who asserted that the state deprived them of the right to cycle in the way that was most pleasurable and exciting, and that failure to use helmets posed no threat to others. In short, these laws were, they asserted, an example of overreaching state intrusion, of gross paternalism. Nevertheless, when the courts reviewed these statutes, they were almost never overturned as unconstitutional. **A court in Massachusetts noted, “From the moment of the injury, society picks the person up off the highway; delivers him to a municipal hospital and municipal doctors; provides him with unemployment compensation if, after recovery, he cannot replace his lost job; and if the injury causes permanent disability many assure the responsibility for his and his family's continued sustenance. We do not understand a state of mind that permits a plaintiff to think that only he himself is concerned”**

...

> when increasingly restrictive measures were imposed on smoking in public settings, the central justification was that passive smoking was pathogenic and responsible for deaths associated with cancer and heart disease. It was almost never asserted that limits on advertising, increases in taxes and restrictions on public smoking were necessary to protect those who might begin to smoke or those who were smokers.",SFepicure,,grawe2,frzo3ka

[In response to 911](https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/jetage/jetage20.cfm), TSA was created to screen passengers and luggage before boarding flights. 

In 2010, TSA implemented a system called [""Quiet Skies""](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tsa-s-quiet-skies-program-raises-legal-civil-liberty-questions-n895806) which came to public light in 2018.

>If a passenger is selected for such secret tracking, a federal air marshal monitors him or her during the flight. The air marshal notes in a ""behavior checklist"" whether the individual slept, shaved or changed clothes mid-flight, or boarded last, among other criteria. The air marshal also takes note of whether the passenger has a ""cold penetrating stare"" or is fidgeting, the Globe reported.

>The data is then sent to the TSA, although it's not clear what happens to the information afterwards.

Using information from a freedom of information act, [aclu found](https://www.aclu.org/report/bad-trip-debunking-tsas-behavior-detection-program)-

> Academic research and other documents in the TSA’s own files reinforce that behavior detection is unscientific and unreliable.

>Materials in the TSA’s files raise further questions about anti-Muslim bias and the origins and focus of the TSA’s behavior detection program.

 ""In the interest of protecting communal health, public health authorities are legally authorized in many jurisdictions to require physical examination and treatment, in a reasonable, safe, and proper manner, of persons who are known to be, or suspected of being, infected with a communicable disease.45 These public health powers are often used in cases involving children, persons with mental disabilities, or  prisoners, or when any autonomous person presents a danger to the public or violates a valid rule or order pertaining to controlling infectious disease. Three fundamental interests support a state’s use of compulsory examination or treatment in cases involving TB disease: (1) preserving an individual’s own health or life; (2) preventing harm to others; and (3) avoiding the possible development of drug resistance (especially related to MDR TB and XDR TB).45 In one state, for example, it appears that the State Board of Health may petition a probate court to order commitment of a non-adherent individual with TB disease for compulsory treatment.65 Even in such instances, forcible administration of examinations or treatments may not be permissible.

The size, strength, and transparency of the US economy means that US treasury securities are considered essentially ""risk free"" in the financial world. As the article above mentions, something like 60% of foreign reserves are in USD denomination. So long as that is the case, demand for the USD will remain strong, giving the US quite a bit of economic leverage. 

For another country's currency to contest the USD as the global reserve currency, other countries would need to feel the same level of trust and security that has been built up around the USD for the last century. One big issue for China at the moment is concerns around [currency manipulation](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm751).

,"In an effort to present a neutral stance I will present arguments for China becoming the Next world superpower and then arguments that rebut, or at least attempt to rebut, those statements. I will close with a conclusion. 

As a matter of clarification, ""China"" will refer to the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) and will generally exclude the [Region of Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) who call themselves the Republic of China. Chinese-Taiwanese relations are often referred to as [Cross Strait Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Strait_relations)

**Arguments For**

Following [China's inclusion in the WTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_the_World_Trade_Organization) in the early 2000s the Chinese economy has seen more than 5% real growth in GDP, [GDP is the measure off all economic activity in a country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product), as shown by [this table of [Chinese economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China#Macroeconomic_trends). This economic growth has lead to a 20 fold increase in Chinese GDP since its inclusion in the WTO. The growth of the Chinese economy has lead to the Chinese ecomomy being the [largest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)) if measured in terms of purchasing power parity. However the [Chinese economy is still smaller than the USA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)) if listed nominally. Note that the wiki lists the CIA world factbook, the IMF, and the World Bank as sources. Pick your favorite of the three sources, they all agree. 

Just an explanation: Nominal GDP refers to the amount, usually in USD, that a country produces. [Purchasing Power Parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) refers to the equivalent amount of stuff one can buy as the value that country produces. Differences arise in these different measurements because stuff is more expensive in some countries than others. 

So to recap, the Chinese economy has grown rapidly over the last two decades and by some measures has overtaken the USA as the largest economy. This as it's on it's own is significant evidence that China is, or is becoming, the next world superpower. Increased economic activity has allowed China to [increase its military funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China), it is also generally accepted that China [under reports it's military funding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China#Unofficial_estimates). China has used that better funded military to exert [hard power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_power) in instances shuch as the [South China Sea Dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea) and [territorial disputes with India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute). China is also conducting the [Belt and Road initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) in an attempt to spread or exert [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power) projection. 

So to conclude, China's rapidly expanding economy has allowed it to increase its hard and soft power protection as one may expect a world superpower to do. There are similarities to the [US rise to power](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/short-history/superpower) in the late 1800s and the [British rise to power](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Rise-to-Power-Victorians/) in the post-Napoleonic era. Now that we have looked into some arguments for a Chinese rise to Superpower status let's look at some arguments against. 

**Arguments Against**

Although the Chinese economy has grown substantially in the last 20 years the Chinese average gross domestic product in [nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita) and in [PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) terms are still low. Average GDP is the GDP (using whatever measurement system you want) devided by population. China ranks in the 60s and 70s by most sources both nominally and PPP, again three sources are listed separately. China, in terms of wealth per citizen finds company firmly in the [""developing economies""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country) category.

Further, Chinese hard power while having increased is, arguably, not at the level of the US, let alone the rest of [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO). Just look at the [relative military spending between the US and China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures). For a more concrete example we could examine the difference in [Chinese aircraft carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_aircraft_carrier_programme) and the current [US Carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier) and the [newer ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford-class_aircraft_carrier). The Chinese carriers are Ukrainian built ships with 1980's technology and conventional (non-nuclear) power plants. The US carriers are modern and currently being upgraded, they also use nuclear power plants that allow for greater endurance. The US also has 10 carriers while china has 2 with 1 under construction.

This brings us to soft power projection. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgXmUubTIYw) is a panel discussion on whether or not  the belt and road initiative is a trillion dollar waste of money. ALL of the people at that panel are more knowledgeable about this topic than I am. I encourage you to watch the video and know that there are many more out there. 

**Conclusion**

TLDR: Maybe. 

China will unquestionably have a ""seat at the table"" in global affairs for the foreseeable future. Any assertion that a country with a top three economy and a [permanent seat on the UN security council](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/current-members) will not have say is wrong bordering on propaganda. 

Will China be the number one super power in the world? I would say no but it is certainty possible. It is also possible that China rises to such a prominence that it may share that number one seat with the US. 

Are Chinese interests a threat to the west? Chinese territorial expansion such as in the South China Sea is contrary to western interests. However increased Chinese economic activity may allow western firms such as [Nike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.#Finance) and [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/09/apple-stock-hits-new-all-time-high-on-china-iphone-sales-data.html) to expand in the Chinese market. However, this brings up the further question: what is ""the west""? Is the West the Governments, people, or companies in those areas, or some combination of the aforementioned groups? Ultimately, everyone's interests can be seen as threatening to everyone else, that's why they are called YOUR interests.

Namely, it seems that India is more likely to play ball with the Western world, especially in trade and business methods.

So my basic question would be, why do we feel differently about these two places? If India was more 'autonomous', would we see them as a similar threat? And is the simple formula of growth+autonomy enough to put other countries on edge? Perhaps this compare and contrast could be a useful lens through which to examine the discussion.",ViennettaLurker,,gppxow,frot905
,"You are spot on in your analysis.

I'd also add that China loans money to nations they know will never be able to pay it back to seize the infrastructure pacifically : https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/asia/china-sri-lanka-port.html

That way they can expand their influence ""in land"" on other countries, by seizing part of the infra.

When it comes to influence they also shamelessly broadcast propaganda on US soil [by broadcasting from Mexico.](https://freebeacon.com/national-security/mexican-radio-beam-chinese-propaganda/) There is also a lot of known case of cyber espionage trough [proxy companies such as Huawey](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18264283/huawei-security-threat-experts-china-spying-5g) where they implement backdoors on hardware level (the hardware which constitutes the communication network infrastructure).

So yes, there is a coordinated effort from the China government to expand its influence to the detriment of western influence.

China also is economically and culturally very strong. They have a significant population and they are definitely a large player in world politics.

But China is somewhat the last (albeit some very small nations) communist nation. That's the key point onto why China is antagonist to the United States.

The summary: 12/16 times (75%) that a global or regional #2 economic power got Close to the #1, it resulted in outright war.

I’d argue that their analysis is imperfect, and the number is low.

Their 4 examples of non war include:

-US and USSR, and the Cold War. MAD prevented open war, but they still had proxy wars. Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, etc.

-Japan post WWII. Japan was constitutionally not allowed to have an army, and had US forces basically sitting in Japanese bases as a Damocles sword to ensure they Didn’t build an army.

-Germany and the UK in the 90’s. They were part of a shared economy and international governing structure via the EU. So having that level of intense entanglement Does work to stop war.

-UK and US around 1900. US (#2) passed the UK (#1), and became new #1. UK almost went to war, but basically... blinked first.

So of those examples- I’d argue Japan shouldn't be on there at all. Having no military should exclude them. And US/ USSR has proxy wars. So there was war, just not direct.

So 13/15 were either war, or proxy war. 87% chance.

Are the US and China So entangled that they share an international EU-Esque governing structure? Nope. So that 1/15 longshot should also be excluded.

And we are down to: 13/14 times, when two entirely separate countries got Close in economic and military might... they want to war. Either directly, or via proxies.

That’s a 93% chance. And given both are nuclear, MAD suggests: a proxy war, as China gets closer and closer to equal might.

Alternatives: 

-the US manages to damage the Chinese economy enough to hold them back. Temporary fix- they have 4x the population, and steadily grow per capita GDP.

-the US opens the floodgates of immigration and grows population aggressively, to stay forever Far ahead of china’s nominal GDP. Unlikely- given US nationalistic/ anti-immigrant sentiment of the last ~20 years.

So, it is highly likely that war, probably proxy war, happens between the US and China by roughly 2040 (looking at economic growth patterns).

Likely candidates: Taiwan, Iran, several African countries.",PragmaticSquirrel,,gppxow,froqrbn
,"The power of a nation is based on its economy and population.  China has a population \~4X that of the US.  If living standards converge in the coming century and the US doesn't pull some magic out of its hat then China will be more powerful than the US.

Here's how the GDPs of countries have evolved over time since the 1800s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-2nqd6-ZXg&list=LLGseWXs3WMr1jnLMtoupfhg&index=3&t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-2nqd6-ZXg&list=LLGseWXs3WMr1jnLMtoupfhg&index=3&t=0s)

Basically what you see if that china and india had the world's largest economies but then Europe and the US industrialized which made them extremely wealthy relative to everyone else.  The rest of the world has been industrializing since then.  You see Japan did very well then its growth flattens out.  In the year 2000 China starts to go very well and now it has the world's largest economy.

To the anglosphere this is strange because its a large shift in world power which we were really told about.

To cut a long story short China and India are going to have economies that are much larger than the United States.  I don't know whether they will also build enormous militaries like the US but who knows.

China apparently has large internal problems.  Rapid industrialization has meant many cities are highly polluted and its demographics are pretty bad.  From what I understand the consent to the current ruling class is based largely on the fact that they have provided excellent economic growth.  So the party is understandably anxious to continue this so they can continue their lives of wealth and power.  There are some truly distopian plans to combine state run social media with population monitoring that I've heard about (sesame credit).

I don't know much about India.  They have a very large population but seem to be growing more slowly.  China seems anxious to control sea-faring trade routes in and out of India  so they can dominate their main continental rival.

China has given many gifts to many countries around the world to gain political influence.  I seem to recall that they saved Greece's economy and as a result Greece vetoed an EU resolution that would have prevented foreign powers from purchasing strategically important infrastructure within the EU.  Also the EU is becoming less vociferous about China's human right's violations.

China has helped the economies of Laos and Cambodia in an effort to gain power in South East Asia.  The main river of the area comes from China and flow through Laos and Cambodia.  A dam upstream (or more politically tenably in Laos or Cambodia) would give a lot of leverage.

So far China seems to be using soft power.  Its bribing a coalition of states that it can assist and dominate in a similar manner to how the United States operated after the second world war.  They're influencing EU politics.  Several Australian politicians have recently admitted to being bribed by the Chinese.  I think their covert actions are largely considered to be pervasive.

They have no navy like the US so their capacity to project force is limited to Asia and perhaps east Africa.

tl;dr its the economy stupid.

PS. I hope their population becomes more free in the future.  I'm afraid of the oppressive force of their state.  I remember not so long ago when conventional wisdom was that countries just kind of seem to move towards democracy as they become richer.  Like a lot of conventional wisdom it's ridiculous.  I think of that then I think of how the conventional wisdom regarding nuclear war is that it'll never happen because it would mean the destruction of both parties.  But historically this is not the case.  Several times throughout history the world has nearly had a significant nuclear exchange.  The Cuban missile crisis is the most well known.  The defence minister of the time is quoted as saying that the world escaped nuclear war on that occasion by ""luck"".",nicolas42,,gppxow,frqle9b
,">I know very little of global politics

IMHO a cohesive theory goes a far way in explaining global politics.  There are many, but one that has stood the test of time and many attempts at debunking is [realism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/).  Realism doesn't place moral impetus on how or why a nation exists or does what it does except for simple survival.  

One branch of realism that has gone very far in predicting how China would act for the past 20-30 years is [offensive realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_realism), created by John Mearsheimer.  He predicted before 2000 that China, once it reached economic parity with the United States, would attempt to oust the US out of Asia, and if its power on a parity level began to approach the US, would likely attempt a hegemonic play usurping the US's global hegemony.  The idea behind the theory is that so long as there is competition in the political realm, there is a meaningful threat, because competition at this level involves societal security, so states will move to neutralize any and all threats and attempt hegemony.  This theory goes beyond China and applies to any and all nations.  Mearsheimer in his book [Tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Great_Power_Politics) outlined how Europe for 200 years before the turn of the century engaged in endless wars despite robust trade and cultural similarities.  IMHO no other theory has greater explanatory powers in the international arena.",CQME,,gppxow,frwbag8
,"**Myth 1: China, like the Soviet Union, is run by a rigid  sclerotic communist party that remains in power only through suppressing  its own population**. For instance, Mark Esper, the US Secretary  of Defence said in February 2020, “…under President Xi’s rule, the  Chinese Communist Party is heading even faster and further in the wrong  direction – more internal repression, more predatory economic practices,  more heavy-handedness, and most concerning for me, a more aggressive  military posture.”

**Reality: The greatest explosion of personal freedoms that the  Chinese people have experienced in the past 4,000 years has taken place  in the last 40 years**, especially for the bottom fifty percent  of Chinese society. 40 years ago the Chinese people could not choose  where to live, what to wear, where to work, what to study. There were  zero tourists leaving China. Today, 134 million Chinese (or one-third of  America’s population) leave China freely. Then they return home freely.  Instead of suffering repression, the Chinese have experienced a great  liberation in their personal lives. Jean Fan, a Stanford psychologist,  has observed that “in contrast to America’s stagnation China’s culture,  self-concept and morale are being transformed at a rapid pace – mostly  for the better”. Independent surveys, like the Edelman Trust Barometer  2019 report, show that in China, 90% of the people trust their  government. In America, only 39% do.

China is not perfect. It faces many real challenges. The biggest  challenge it faces is long-term political succession. Who will succeed  Xi? However the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is not sclerotic like its  Soviet counterpart. It has developed the world’s largest meritocracy. In  contrast to American policy-making, which is driven by short-term  electoral considerations, China’s policies are driven by careful  long-term strategic calculations.

The core calculation is and remains that the Chinese people will  tolerate some limits on their political rights (and those of others) so  long as the government continues to provide them with what are, in  practical terms, better, freer, and more prosperous daily lives. And the  CCP is increasingly agile in upholding its end of the bargain.

Even though China’s environment was ravaged by rapid  industrialisation a few decades ago (like in the Western Industrial  Revolution), China has since then made a massive U-turn and launched an  effort to become the world’s first Ecological Civilization. China learns  quickly from its mistakes. After its initial mis-steps in Wuhan, the  subsequent response of the Chinese government to the COVID-19 outbreak  was one of the most effective of any government in the world. The WHO  said “In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out  perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment  effort in history… By extension, the reduction that has been achieved in  the force of COVID-19 infection in China has also played a significant  role in protecting the global community.”

America is therefore making a big strategic mistake in  underestimating the strength and resilience of both the Chinese  government and Chinese civilization. Professor Wang Gungwu says that the  Chinese civilization is the only civilization to be knocked down four  times and stand up again each time. Chinese civilization today is  experiencing one of its strongest resurgences ever in its history. Many  Americans are not aware of this.

**Myth 2: American society, based on democratic accountability and capitalism, will always be supple and flexible.** Unlike  the rigid Soviet bureaucracy, American society is always reinventing  itself and adapting creatively and intelligently to each new challenge  thrown in its way. Hence, it can only triumph against communist  party-run states, like China.

**Reality: American society** ***used to be*** **supple and flexible**.  This generated some of the biggest triumphs ever seen in human history:  the world’s largest middle class society, the moon-landings, the  dramatic victory over the mighty Soviet Union without firing a shot, the  world’s most successful new corporations. Yes, it would be a huge  mistake for China to underestimate America as an adversary.

Yet, the latest data also shows tremendous deteriorations in American  society. America was famous for its social mobility. Today America is  the only major developed country where the average income of the bottom  fifty percent has gone down over a thirty year period. Sadly, this  stagnation of income has also resulted in a lot of human pain and  suffering, as documented by two Princeton University economists, Anne  Case and Angus Deaton. The white working classes of America used to  carry the American dream of getting a better life in their hearts and  souls. Today, as Case says, there is a “sea of despair” among them. She  and Deaton conclude: “Ultimately, we see our story as about the collapse  of the white, high-school-educated working class after its heyday in  the early 1970s, and the pathologies that accompany that decline.” The  detailed study of Case and Deaton documents how poor economic prospects  “compounds over time through family dysfunction, social isolation,  addiction, obesity and other pathologies.” American society has never  been more troubled.

In theory, American society can make U-turns and recover. In  practice, this is a myth. American decision-making has become rigid and  captured by special interests. For example, the primary contest with  China will not be in the defence sphere. America should cut its defence  budget, reduce its participation in foreign wars and focus on internal  social and economic development. However, defence budgets are not  decided by rational analysis. They are the result of intense lobbying by  vested interests.

**Myth 3: America and China have absolutely opposing interests  and values. Both countries have no choice but to head for a complete  confrontation**. Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, has said  “It is no longer realistic to ignore the fundamental differences between  our two systems” and the impact of these differences on “American  national security”. He added that “we’re finally realizing the degree to  which the Communist Party is truly hostile to the United States and its  values”.

**Reality: The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is not hostile to America.** The  former Soviet Communist Party declared its ideological opposition to  America. Khrushchev once said “Whether you like it or not, history is on  our side. We will bury you!” China has no such goal.

Nor does it have any desire to export its political system, culture,  and values to the rest of the world. American leaders have always had a  universalising mission. They believed that America’s role was to serve  as a “shining city on the hill”. The more the rest of the world emulated  American values and practices, the more it would be better off.

China has no such universalising mission. It believes that only  Chinese can practice Chinese values. The primary goal of the Chinese  government is to rejuvenate Chinese civilisation and ensure that there  is no repetition of the century of humiliation it suffered from 1842 to  1949. In the eyes of many objective Asian observers, the CCP actually  functions as the “Chinese *Civilization* Party”. Its soul is not  rooted in the foreign ideology of Marxism-Leninism but in the rich  cultural reservoirs of Chinese civilisation. In this regard there is no  fundamental contradiction between America and China. Hence, if both  America and China adopt a more live and let live policy, there’s room  for both to live in peace with each other. Equally importantly, the six  billion people who live outside America and China also want to see this  happen.

Americans frequently oversimplify China’s aims – declaring that China  is a threat to democracy, in America and the rest of the world.  Christopher Wray, the FBI director, has said, “One of the things we’re  trying to do is view the China threat as not just a whole-of-government  threat, but a whole-of-society threat…  and I think it’s going to take a  whole-of-society response by us.” Curiously, the world’s two other  largest democracies, India and Indonesia, don’t feel threatened by  Chinese ideology. They are deeply concerned by the sharp increase in  China’s power. But they don’t foresee any ideological confrontation with  China. Neither should America.

Equally importantly in our shrinking, interconnected and  interdependent planet, America and China also share common national  interests in fighting pressing common global challenges (like Covid-19  or climate change). Both would benefit from greater cooperation. If  America and China don’t come together to deal with their global  challenges, future generations will see both of them as two tribes of  apes that continued fighting over territory while the forest around them  was burning.

In addition to OP's source, the  [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/blog/smart-justice/mass-incarceration/how-1994-crime-bill-fed-mass-incarceration-crisis) also concluded that the federal government's limited jurisdiction meant it has a limited influence over rising incarceration rates and that these rates were already rising by the time the 1994 Crime Bill passed. This lack of jurisdiction can be seen in current prison statistics which indicates that [88% of prisoners in 2017](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p17.pdf) are held at the State level and as the [Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration) piece points out, the 1994 Crime Bill only led to a few states adopting harsher criminal justice.

This is a little difficult for me to answer, but I will try my best.

The crime bill took a huge number of black fathers off the street and into prison. Whether you think it was the right thing to do or not is immaterial. I am a staunch conservative libertarian. Seeing people imprisoned for drug offenses has always pissed me off. I don't do drugs, because they are really bad for me. That doesn't give me the right to dictate what you do with your body, though.

The aftereffects of this in the black community were devastating. Many studies (Including one by the Brookings institute) show a very strong correlation between success and two parent homes. This has been shown to be true across all races in America. Probably around the world too, but I have no data on that. As a direct result of single parent families, black communities had seen a huge spike in poverty, gang activity and violence. These issues still plague their communities today.

,"Here's the CDC's current guidance document, the recommended gating criteria for each phase of reopening in a jurisdiction are listed in a table on page 7: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/CDC-Activities-Initiatives-for-COVID-19-Response.pdf

Appendix E (page 25) goes into more detail on the data sources for the gating criteria and how decreases/rebounds can be calculated. An example for one of the criteria:

> Data Sources: Case report information for confirmed and probable cases collected by state and local
jurisdictions and submitted to CDC; publicly available aggregated case count data (e.g., USAFacts:
https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/); US Census population
estimates (used as denominator for incidence calculations)

> • Assessing criteria for reduction in number of cases: To pass this criterion, a locality must either 1) have
experienced 14 days of decreasing cases or 2) be in a low-incidence plateau. A locality that has a new
outbreak or rebound cannot advance to the next phase unless they see another 14 days of decline.

> • Defining 14 days of decreasing cases: To assess a downward trajectory, CDC uses a 3-day rolling
average and applies a spline curve (described above). A period of 14 days of declining cases occurs
when fewer cases are reported at the end of the 14 days compared with the number at the beginning
of the period, using the 3-day rolling average fitted with the spline curve to define the number of cases.
In addition, a “grace period” of 5 days may be applied during a downward trajectory, during which
cases may increase for no more than 5 consecutive days. (If 5 days of consecutive increase occur, then
the jurisdiction has met the criteria for rebound and is no longer in a downward trajectory.) Statistical

Do we have enough test kits?

Are the tests trending neutral or downwards?

Are the death rates trending trending neutral or downwards?

What is our hospital capacity at?

,"**Summary Answer:** the data is whatever the CDC has compiled and organized for review by the relevant government officials, who then go on to report to elected executives (like a Governor) and often members of legislatures too. 

In fact the CDC has an entire system for this. One key part of this system is the **National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)**

https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-collection.html


Let's see how this works from the bottom (people getting infected and going to a hospital) to the top (the elected executives making decisions): 

1.) Hospitals, clinics, commercial laboratories, nursing homes, and any community with dedicated medical staffing engage with patients reporting symptoms. 

2.) Point of care testing occurs, results eventually make their way to central laboratories, which are required to report to the local authorities (such as your state's Department of Health).

3.) Each local municipality has laws requiring certain diseases be reported to the state authorities. 

4.) Each state has laws requiring certain diseases be reported at the state level, but it is **voluntary** for states to provide information or notifications to CDC at the federal level.  

5.) CDC receives case notifications from at least 57 reporting jurisdictions.

6.) CDC analyzes and provides reports to the federal government and state governments. 

7.) Governments make decisions. 

So this 7 step process, is roughly how data is collected and reported up the ""hierarchy."" It is my opinion that state's should not be allowed to opt-in or opt-out of reporting to the CDC (microbes don't respect borders). I am honestly surprised that the federal government has not tried to rein this in as early as the Spanish Flu (which technically originated in the USA).

POTUS blames a lot of the current pandemic issues on the governors, which could be true, except the governors he is specifically criticizing are ones that already opt-in to CDC reporting (part of the 57 jurisdictions). While he ignores the governors that refuse to report data. 
https://apnews.com/34eaba9d4bb9b905c3413b57b88fe69c


Note: The notifiable diseases data voluntarily shared by these 57 jurisdictions represents only a portion of the public health surveillance data that jurisdictions collect and use to make decisions and conduct public health activities in their communities (e.g., outbreak detection and control).  There are several important distinctions between a reportable disease and a notifiable disease. But that's a comment for another day.

,"I think some of the questions and focus presented in this post are in some respects misfocused. While it is called Obamagate, the allegations involved have more to do with actions his administration took rather than ones Obama personally took. For example, the Fox News opinion piece you provide starts its discussions about the Obama Administration, and not Obama himself. It's fair to argue Trump doesn't see it that way, but based on the provided Fox News article not everyone sees it the same way as Trump does. In my opinion, it's a large umbrella term that misses the actual picture of what improper action there is.

> i) What crime (official lawful infraction) is Obama alleged to have committed and what is the evidence supporting or opposing that allegation?

[None](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/politics/william-barr-obama-biden-investigation-durham/index.html) according to AG Bill Barr.

> ii) Aside from legality/illegality, what is alleged to be improper about what Obama did?

There currently isn't enough information available to fully answer this. [President Obama learned of](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-knew-details-of-wiretapped-flynn-phone-calls-surprising-top-doj-official-new-docs-show) the Flynn call before Acting AG Sally Yates did, which raises questions on how he learned about it and whether there was anything ""improper"" about how he came to know. Regardless, since he was President at the time, giving him wide authority, and given Barr's comments, it's fair to assume he likely did nothing improper.

> iii) What statements have been made arguing that Obama's actions were or weren't immoral?

I think the Fox News article you provide gives enough examples of alleged improper action if you are interested in exploring both sides of the argument. The best deep dive I've seen, not so much of ""Obamagate"", but of what the core arguments of impropriety by the Obama administration that is the source of the Obamagate claim, exists is this opinion piece by [Eli Lake](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/eli-lake/michael-flynn-gets-railroaded-by-the-fbi/) and in the IG report about the Carter Page FISA warrant. (https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf)

> iv) Is this an issue that came out this week, or is it a new narrative based on publicly known information?

This is somewhat complicated to answer. The recent focus is due to the DoJ deciding to drop the case against Michael Flynn and the accompanying revelations (see Eli Lake or Fred Flietz piece) that were associated with their decision. People have [long claimed](https://www.newsweek.com/alan-dershowitz-mueller-michael-flynn-trump-fbi-lying-impeach-rudy-giuliani-1261947) (NOTE: Apologies for the biased language of the source) that Flynn wasn't treated properly. There are also the long existing complaints about the Carter Page FISA warrant that were first really brought to focus by [Devin Nunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunes_memo) and explored in the earlier posted IG report.

> v) Aside from embarking on an ambitious research project to find truth every time something happens, is there any way to actually know what is happening during stories like this? Are there go-to sources that can be universally trusted when it comes to deciphering alleged political scandals?

For this story? No. Liberal and conservative leaning outlets are going to say whatever fits their world view like how people still argue about whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government despite us in theory having a document, the Mueller Report, that was thought to conclusively answer that question. The DoJ deciding to drop the case damages their credibility on the issue one way or the other depending on whether or not you support their decision. The best thing you can do is get opinions from both sides, examine the evidence yourself, and try and view things from as neutral a perspective as you can.

In regards to the question asked by the title of this article:

> What specific crimes, misdeeds or improprieties are alleged to have been committed under the ""Obamagate"" moniker and what evidence is there to support or oppose those allegations?

There are quite a few allegations of crimes, misdeeds, and improper actions, but which ones are being taken seriously is currently unknown. At minimum, we know that US Attorney [John Durham is leading a criminal investigation](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/politics/william-barr-obama-biden-investigation-durham/index.html) looking at potential wrong doing and criminal action.

The most commonly mentioned ones, and I bring these up not to say that they are confirmed/not confirmed but for completeness sake, that are worth noting in my opinion are as follows:

Criminal Accusations:

1. [An FBI lawyer edited an email](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fbi-lawyer-under-criminal-investigation-altered-document-to-say-carter-page-was-not-a-source-for-another-agency) used to obtain a FISA warrant on Carter Page. This is a matter that was referred by the DOJ IG and is thought to be under investigation by Durham. 

2. Perjury by either [James Comey or James Clapper](https://nypost.com/2020/05/13/gop-plans-to-grill-comey-clapper-on-possible-perjury/). In regards to who briefed Obama on the Flynn call, they both gave contradictory answers before Congress under oath. Andrew McCabe in his book backed Comey's versions of events (see previous source), so it would be more likely that Clapper may have lied. There is no indication that this is under investigation by the DOJ.

3. Whoever leaked details about the [Flynn call to the Washington Post](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/trump-critic-mark-zaid-represented-ukraine-whistleblower-prosecute-unmasker-leaked-michael-flynn/).

Improper action/abuse

1. The issues outlined by the DOJ IG in his report. These issues include abuses of the FISA process to spy on Carter Page.

2. Whether or not the government failed to turn over [Brady material in the Flynn case](https://jonathanturley.org/2020/05/05/did-the-mueller-team-violate-brady/). This is a highly contentious claim that many will disagree with.

3. Actions taken by the FBI in their attempts to interview Flynn, particularly whether or not it was a Perjury trap, why they would be trying to get him fired, why they investigated him over the Logan Act despite it not having been used since before the civil war, not informing Flynn it was a crime to lie to the FBI, indicating he wouldn't need a lawyer present, and not consulting with the DOJ/WH Counsel office beforehand. This is discussed in the [decision to drop the case](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6883960-Flynn-Dismiss-D-D-C-17-Cr-00232-Dckt-000198-000.html)

4. The unmasking per your provided articles.

tl;dr Obama likely didn't do anything wrong and the ""Obamagate"" theory is overly broad, unfocused, and frankly dumb, but the theory does have some legitimate claims of malfeasance and criminal issues under its wide umbrella that shouldn't make every aspect it encompasses dismissed just because of its name or other parts of its conspiracy being false.",Darkframemaster43,,gngtrw,frddvgz
,"Here is what I understand. The fox news link seems to do a pretty good job of outlining Trump's version of the events. However, according to other sources, it seems extremely misleading. The main accusation by Trump is that Obama was deliberately targeting his incoming administration by unmasking Flynn's name in an illegal spy action and then leaking it to the press.

But if we look at context provided by NPR ( [https://www.npr.org/2020/05/14/855820024/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-flynn-biden-and-unmasking-story](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/14/855820024/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-flynn-biden-and-unmasking-story) ) there is no reason to believe that the attempt to unmask his name had anything to do with actions against Trump. Apparently, they were actually surveilling the Russians and Flynn was swept up in the surveillance because of his communications with them. They wouldn't have known who the U.S. person in the communications were until they unmasked the name. Logically, this makes sense. Unmasking a name means you don't know who that person is. How could they target Trump's administration unless they knew he was the name that would be unmasked? If their intent was to spy on Flynn, then why would his name be masked at all?

There is additional evidence that supports Obama's side. Relevant parts from the following article indicate that Obama was especially concerned about avoiding any appearance of a conflict of interest, and also indicates that Flynn's unmasking was unrelated to his Russia conversations.

It provides nothing to back up its claim [about Flynn's unmasking](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-obamagate-flynn-unmasking-conspiracy-got-blown-to-pieces-2020-5) being improper, and unmasking requests themselves are obscenely common, not ""sensitive and rare"".

Then the article spins off in to talking about intellegence policy throughout the years, what things it hits on that is true was widely covered at the time and Obama was roundly criticized for it. You can fault him for his expansion of domestic surveilance but it isn't some -gate that is just being revealed and it certainly isn't any pattern that Trump hasn't continued and more.

Unless people are making specific credible claims about what someone else did, there is not  claim.

To me this says it all. Trump is accusing Obama of committing a crime, but gives the “you don’t know her, she goes to a different school” response when asked for more details. To me what this reveals is that there is no criminal statute actually being alleged to have been violated, therefore making “Obamagate” just a marketing ploy, or a vague attempt to smear Obama during an election year with a newly named “scandal” that never took place. The way our criminal system works is that someone suspected of committing a crime gets arraigned before anything else, basically a formal accusation of breaking specific criminal statutes.

I know that a trump press conference is wildly different than a court of law, but you would never be able to just arrest someone and say, “it’s obvious, everyone knows what they did.” But that is exactly what trump is trying to do here.

---

Here's my attempt to briefly summarize these arguments: The intelligence community, most prominently the FBI's counterintelligence investigators, were aware that Russian intelligence operatives had made contact with members of the Trump campaign as part of the Russian attack on the 2016 US election, and in particular that the incoming National Security Advisor had made several unusual phone calls arranging back-channel diplomacy with the Russian ambassador before taking office. However, the outgoing president told the then-FBI director to evaluate whether it was safe to fully inform the incoming administration about these security concerns, and indeed the FBI did not immediately inform the president-elect about its concerns that members of his campaign and his incoming administration might have been compromised, apparently out of a fear that those campaign and administration members might find out they were being investigated and cover their tracks. When the FBI went on to interview Flynn about those conversations with the Russian ambassador, they asked him questions they already knew the answers to, so when he lied to them they could use that criminal act as leverage in their eventual deal for cooperation in their ongoing investigation of the Russian attack.

So basically the narrative is that the intelligence community had concerns about the incoming Trump team, and it should have trusted the Trump team enough to tell them these concerns for their own safety and cooperation, instead of initially keeping them secret for the protection of their ongoing investigations.

That's my attempt at a neutral description. But these authors also say that, e.g. ""Obama knew the Russia investigation was a hoax from the get-go."" If so, then of course that would make the outgoing president's and the intelligence community's concerns and hesitance about the incoming administration more alarming.",Epistaxis,,gngtrw,frcun9h

,"Answer: ""Gate"" is a term that is often tacked on to the end of a term to refer to a political scandal. This started after the Watergate scandal, wherein operatives for the Nixon re-election campaign were caught breaking into Democratic National Party HQ, which was located at the Watergate Hotel and office complex in Washington, D.C.
Recently, the hashtag #Obamagate has been used on Twitter and elsewhere to reference various events and actions by the Obama administration that are believed to be scandalous.

This past week a tranche of documents were released relating to the Federal prosecution of President Obama's former Defense Intelligence Agency Director General Michael Flynn. Flynn was also tapped by President Trump to serve as his National Security Advisor, but only served in that capacity for a short time before stepping down. The reason for his resignation, largely believed to have been requested by the administration, is an accusation that Flynn violated Federal Statute by lying to FBI agents during an interview regarding his call with Russian Ambassador Kislyak.

Included in the documents are internal memos and communications, including handwritten notes taken by FBI top level attorney Bill Priestap, which indicate the FBI's intent during the interview with Flynn was to get him to lie in order to potentially prosecute and/or get him fired.

Additionally, there a supposedly documents that give the impression that President Obama was aware of the surveillance of General Flynn as well as the content of his call with the Russian ambassador, causing many to believe that President Obama was involved with framing his former intelligence official.

Recent document releases by the DoJ point to a meeting in January 2017 meeting just before the transition between top administration officials where the perjury trap against Gen Flynn was discussed and orders were given to hide national security information from the Trump administration.

Regardless where you stand on the political spectrum, hiding information from an incoming president’s administration and setting up a perjury trap for a member of the president’s cabinet should be very concerning. At this point the ‘ObamaGate’ term is referring to Obama’s administration’s (not exactly Obama himself) breach of the tradition of peaceful transition of power is the “glory of the Republic,” where the administration of President Barack Obama made efforts to cripple President Trump’s ability to govern via unconstitutional methods throughout the transition and even into the first three years of his term.

,"TLDR: Obamagate refers to the false, intentional, and politically-motivated framing of Donald Trump as a Russian agent. Hillary Clinton paid for damaging information about Trump, Obama took the information and used it to obtain FISA warrants to spy on the trump campaign. They leaked to the media, and in coordination with the fake news was able to have Mueller appointed to potentially remove Trump. The framing was used to damage his election chances, spy upon him, his family, and his campaign, and attempt to have him removed from office. The abuse is widespread. 

While Obamagate is named after Obama the scandal is better understood as being conducted by Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the highest level democrats in the DNC, and certain individuals within the executive branch. 

The HRC campaign, along with several republicans, funded the ""Steele Dossier"" in mid to late 2016 which was opposition research intended to be used against Trump in the 2016 election. The document claimed that Trump had been working with the Kremlin in a variety of ways.

Hillary Clinton et al. gave the dossier to the Obama controlled FBI. The FBI continued to pay Steele to produce this information. The FBI then took the claims within the dossier and used it to set up FISA surveillance on several individuals within the trump campaign. It is widely unknown that a FISA warrant grants the ability to spy on the indvidual and everyone within ""3 hops"" of that person. So the target, everyone they contact, everyone they contact, and everyone they contact. So by targeting ancillary people in the trump campaign they tap the entire campaign, trump, and his family. 

You can read on page viii of the FISA Abuse report below that the FBI ""Did not have information corroborating specific allegations against Carter Page in Steele's reporting when it relied upon his reports in the first FISA application or subsequent renewal applications."" Later on page viii ""Our review found that FBI personnel fell far short of the requirement in FBI policy that they ensure that all factual statements in a FISA application are 'scrupulously accurate.'"" 

While there are other FISA abuses, The fruit of the poisonous tree standard is enough to show that the original FISA documents were invalid. Remember, every little salacious Russia Trump rumor came from this and other illegally done spying.

>iv) Is this an issue that came out this week, or is it a new narrative based on publicly known information?

You might read all of this and notice that Obama isn't named and can't be sure to have known what the FBI was illegally doing. The reason this scandal has exploded lately is that we have seen an email from Susan Rice that reveals the extent of Obama's involvement and guilt. In this email National Security Advisor Susan Rice describes a meeting with Obama and Comey, director of the FBI, where Obama directs Comey on how Obama wants the spying on Flynn to proceed. This proves that Obama was both aware of the spying and actively involved in its direction.

>i) What crime (official lawful infraction) is Obama alleged to have committed and what is the evidence supporting or opposing that allegation?

The crimes committed depend on how severe you want to be, and whether you judge them by what they did or by what they were trying to do. At the very minimum Obama violated the fourth amendment. Election interference, leaking of classified documents. They tried to frame trump, steal the election, and once the election was lost they tried to have the duly elected president removed. If you want to be as punishing as possible one could charge several of Obama's underlings, and potentially Obama himself, for conspiracy to overthrow the government. 

>ii) Aside from legality/illegality, what is alleged to be improper about what Obama did?

>iii) What statements have been made arguing that Obama's actions were or weren't immoral?

Obama and Hillary Clinton are in the same political party. It's unethical for a candidate for office to ask her fellow party members in government to investigate her opponents using the police and surveillance power of the state. It's unethical for a criminal investigation of a person to begin with accusations funded by his or her political opponent.  Assuming that the democrats in positions of power knew that the russia hoax was not true then you have an outright attempt to overthrow the government.

,"It's important to separate two distinct issues here: whether orders were lawfully issued under *state* law and whether the orders are constitutional with respect to the U.S. Constitution. 

In the Wisconsin case, the court found that Emergency Order 28 conflicted with governing *Wisconsin* law.  Essentially, the holding was that a) the order was issued without complying with relevant procedural safeguards and b) the order exceeded the authority granted to the Secretary of the Department of Health Services under Wisconsin law (see in particular pp. 2-3 of the [opinion](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=260868)).  In general, the U.S. Supreme Court must [give deference](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1832&context=mlr) to state court judgements on state law, so it is unlikely that this holding could be challenged at SCOTUS.

It would be very different if the Wisconsin Supreme court had struck down the order on the basis that it conflicted with the federal constitution.  In this case, SCOTUS review would be natural and a decision would potentially affect all states.

In the Pennsylvania case, the plaintiffs/petitioners raised a variety of claims ([see Pennsylvania Supreme Court opinion](https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/2020/68-mm-2020.html)) under both Pennsylvania law and on constitutional grounds.  Similarly to the Wisconsin case, they alleged that the governor had acted improperly under state (Pennsylvania) law.   They also alleged a violation of the U.S. Constitution.  As mentioned, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is essentially the final arbiter of Pennsylvania law and held that the governor's order did follow state law.

SCOTUS decides for itself what cases to hear or not, and the plaintiffs/petitioners filed a writ of certiorari (a request for the court to hear their case) on the grounds that the Pennsylvania order conflicts with the federal constitution.  They also asked for a stay (blocking the PA order until the disposition of the case).  The Supreme Court [denied](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/050620zr_o75p.pdf) that request for a stay on May 6.  However, that is not actually a ruling at all and does not set a precedent.  In general, rejecting the stay suggests that SCOTUS is unlikely to strike down the PA order as unconstitutional, but it's not actually a ruling.

If SCOTUS were to subsequently take a case and rule that stay-at-home orders are generally constitutional (and it's generally believed that they are), this would not change the situation under state law.  Any given state's order might or might not be lawful under its own laws depending on the specifics, so you would be left by variation.  If, however, SCOTUS takes a case and rules that stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional, then this would strike down all such orders nationwide.  

TL;DR: The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the order as a violation of *Wisconsin* law.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the order under *Pennsylvania* law.  These weren't really cases about constitutionality under the US Constitution (although the PA court did uphold the constitutionality of the PA order).",chadtr5,,gjnrn0,fqmaos7
,"The cases are indeed arguing different things. The Wisconsin decision was based on Wisconsin law, which requires ""rules"" by executive officials (like the Wisconsin Department of Health) to have input from the Wisconsin legislature. I'm not sure what the Pa. decision was based on, but it certainly was not Wisconsin law. 

As a side note, this is exactly why a federal response would be appropriate to avoid differences between the states that will cause deaths. 

[The Opinion](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=260868). Read the first few pages to get an idea of what exactly they were deciding. It was not based on the federal constitution but Wisconsin law.",tankguy33,,gjnrn0,fqm4yz7
,"These are quite different cases.

The petitioners in the Pennsylvania case made claims that the lockdowns violated both state law and the federal Constitution. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not had time to hear the case (which has to work its way through the system). However, petitioners filed a *stay application*, essentially asking the courts to put the stay-at-home order on hold while the case is resolved. In order to win a stay in a case like this, where both sides plausibly claim they would suffer severe injury if the court rules for the other side, petitioners had to clear a fairly high bar: they had to show a *likelihood of success* in the overall case. The degree of likelihood required varies based on a variety of factors, and I didn't dig into this case enough to know which precise standard applied. But suffice to say that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not find that petitioners were likely to succeed on any of their claims -- state or federal.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court is the *final* authority on the meaning of Pennsylvania state law, so the state claims in this case died there. If they say that the stay-at-home order doesn't violate state statutes or the state constitution, their word is law, and even the U.S. Supreme Court can't gainsay them on that. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, is the final authority on *federal* law, so petitioners appealed their *federal* claims to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Quite frankly, their federal claims were weak, really broad claims about foggy parts of the federal Constitution that don't have much (if any) precedential support. They claimed violations of the Fifth Amendment takings clause, violation of the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause, and violation of the First Amendment assembly right. Appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court was a desperate move for a doomed case.

The U.S. Supreme Court doesn't have to accept review of such cases, or indeed almost any case. It receives thousands of petitions each year, and has time to hear and rule on only a few dozen. The Supreme Court has a bunch of internal, unofficial-but-basically-official rules for what cases it decides to take. (One of them is ""likelihood of success"".) This case didn't meet any of those criteria, so the U.S. Supremes turned it down. 

This is *not* binding on anyone. The U.S. Supremes denied a stay request, which strongly suggests they would later deny a judicial review request if the case ever works its way through the full system, but that's not the same as an official ruling against the petitioners.

Nevertheless, if I were a lawyer trying to get the stay-at-home orders struck down by a federal court by making broad claims about the U.S. Constitution, I would find this decision a very discouraging indicator. The Supreme Court *probably* doesn't think there's any federal right violated by stay-at-home orders.

The Wisconsin case is completely different. In that case, petitioners made some very narrow claims that were entirely about *state* law. Specifically, they argued that, under the Wisconsin Constitution and relevant Wisconsin statutes, the state Health Secretary did not have the authority to unilaterally close businesses. Instead, they insisted, the Secretary had to follow an emergency rulemaking procedure and include the legislature. They did *not* claim that the stay-at-home order inherently violates anyone's fundamental human rights, as the Pennsylvania petitioners argued to the Supreme Court (or, if they did, I didn't see it in my skim-read of the opinion); the Wisconsin petitioners just argued that the stay-at-home order was enacted by an improper procedure under state law.

The Supreme Court of Wisconsin agreed with them. I don't know Wisconsin law well enough, nor have I read the case closely enough, to know whether this is a correct judgment under Wisconsin law. But my opinion doesn't matter, because the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is the *final authority* on Wisconsin law.

This decision will not (and can not) be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court because it only dealt with Wisconsin law. There are no claims about the federal Constitution or federal statutes here. Even if the members of the U.S. Supreme Court happened to disagree with the Wisconsin Supreme Court's interpretations of Wisconsin law, the U.S. Supreme Court has no authority to gainsay them. (There are rare exceptions to this, but I don't see one in this case.)

**TLDR: The U.S. Supreme Court is only relevant when federal law is involved in the case. The Pennsylvania case tried to make an argument based on federal law and fundamental human rights, and basically failed. (Although the case can continue in lower courts.) The Wisconsin case focused entirely on state law and procedural rules, and succeeded.**

* If prosecutors did use the threat of charges against Michael Jr. as leverage, that's within normal prosecutorial conduct, and would not qualify as misconduct.

> Leaning on a potential defendant for cooperation using the criminal liability of family members as leverage is not unheard of. This does not mean the practice is beyond criticism—but the handling of Flynn’s case is not some kind of aberration, let alone the sort of conscience-shocking thing that might justify a dismissal.

* If prosecutors knowingly let Flynn lie and wanted him to lie, that's also within normal prosecutorial conduct.

> Flynn’s new lawyers cite these notes, which were presumably written by then-FBI counterintelligence chief Bill Priestap, as supposed smoking-gun evidence that the FBI was seeking to entrap Flynn in a lie. The trouble with that argument is that absolutely nothing forced Flynn not to tell the truth in that interview. And while FBI officials appear to have discussed the strategic purpose of the interview, there’s nothing whatsoever wrong with that. To be sure, a possible criminal prosecution based on the Logan Act case was weak leverage, given that the statute has virtually no history of enforcement, but agents hold relatively weak leverage over witnesses all the time. And yes, it’s wrong for the bureau to set up an interview in the absence of a viable case in order to induce a witness to lie for purposes of prosecution, **but there’s no evidence that is what happened**—merely evidence that the possibility was on a list of possible strategic goals for the interview. And yes, the bureau will sometimes confront a witness with a lie and specifically warn the person about lying being a felony, but that is not a legal requirement.

> In fact, the Flynn interview gave Flynn every opportunity to tell the truth. As the FBI’s partially redacted memo documenting Flynn’s interview reflects, the questions were careful. They were specific. The agents, as Strzok later recalled in a formal FBI interview of his own, planned to try to jog Flynn’s memory if he said he could not remember a detail by using the exact words they knew he had used in his conversation with Kislyak. And Flynn, as he admitted in open court—twice—did not tell the truth. That is not entrapment or a set-up, and it is very far indeed from outrageous government conduct. It’s conducting an interview—and a witness at the highest levels of government lying in it.

* The investigation had every legitimate basis to interview Flynn. The investigation on him had not yet closed.

> According to the Times, the Jan. 4 decision not to close the case may have resulted from the FBI’s discovery that Flynn had spoken with Kislyak in the previous days and advised Russia against retaliating against U.S. sanctions levied by the Obama administration in response to Russian election interference—the matter about which FBI agents eventually interviewed Flynn, and about which he lied repeatedly to them. The issue was of concern to the bureau in part because it appeared that Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about those contacts as well, and the FBI became worried that Flynn’s falsehoods “posed a blackmail risk,” the Times writes. In other words, there’s a very good explanation for why the FBI made a U-turn on closing Flynn’s case: When the memo was drafted, the writer wasn’t yet aware of the most concerning conduct by Flynn.

> ...there is nothing wrong with the bureau contemplating the closure of a case without interviewing the subject, then deciding not to close it and that an interview is appropriate, proceeding with the interview, and prosecuting the individual for lying in that interview.

,"Unfortunately, I only have limited space to answer, so I'll answer your first point:

> Does the Department of Justice's previous behavior in the Flynn case violate specific laws or ethical guidelines?

Probably. *Brady* is a big deal, and it looks like someone in the special counsel's office deliberately didn't give the materials to Flynn's team.

There are two orders that Van Grack was in charge of following. The first one is a requirement laid out in *[Brady v Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_v._Maryland)* in which all exculpatory evidence is to be turned over to the defense. It created whats known as a procedural right of the defendant and [there isn't a lot of leeway for law enforcement and the prosecution to deny evidence to the defense](https://www.lorman.com/training/law-enforcement/law-enforcement-s-obligation-to-disclose-exculpatory-evidence)- it's actually *duty* on the part of the prosecution to actively comply with *Brady*. Failure to comply with the so-called [Brady rule](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/brady_rule) which can cause courts to toss convictions if the withheld evidence is material to the case.

For example, in [*US v Pellulo*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8643000749536144251&q=u.s.+v.+pellulo,+105+f.3d+117&hl=en&as_sdt=2,44&as_vis=1), the government only provided exculpatory evidence to the defense after two previously tossed convictions. The FBI agents had materials that could have been used to attack their agents' credibility- including 302s and agent notes (sound familiar?). The 3rd Circuit felt that the evidence would have helped him in his trial and reversed his conviction so he could get another trial (his 5th, actually).

The second order that Van Grack was obligated to follow was Judge Sullivan's standing order that Sullivan gave out after the [Ted Stevens case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Stevens#Government_concealment_of_evidence) where the FBI withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense in order to get a conviction. Judge Sullivan was the presiding judge during that trial, and [ever since](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/02/22/no-a-new-court-filing-doesnt-suggest-that-michael-flynn-is-about-to-be-exonerated/) he's been issuing his [Standing Brady Order](https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/sites/dcd/files/StandingBradyOrder_November2017.pdf) in all of his cases. Such an order was sent to Van Grack and his team in 2018, and he told the court multiple times, even as late as [2019](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6234142/132/united-states-v-flynn/) that no evidence surrounding Flynn's interview with the FBI nor any material favorable to him from before it was being suppressed. Van Grack that there were no material changes made to the notes when they were redrafted, and that everything was just OK from the government's side.

The problem with Van Grack's assertion is that there *was* additional evidence that was very material to the prosecution that wasn't released to the defense, specifically around the materiality element of a 1001 charge (these are attached as exhibits 1-12 by the government) along with other documents released publicly on April 29th and other points in the past few weeks. These documents show that the 302s were edited after the fact, and that someone who wasn't present was involved in editing them and there were concerns about editing them too much, and that the investigation itself may not have been properly predicated to begin with. Each on their own is likely something that the defense should have had, but together, it's a gigantic wave of exculpatory material.

Above, I pointed out that this was likely deliberately withheld by the Special Counsel's Office. This is because many of the documents released on April 29th [seem to refer](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6234142/187/1/united-states-v-flynn/) to files that were indexed with ""DOJSCO,"" which presumably the ""Department of Justice, Special Counsel Office."" That means that The Special Counsel's Office had some of files that should have been released, and that meant that *Van Grack* had them, too.

Notably, [AG Barr appointed a US Attorney](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-attorney-tasked-by-barr-with-re-examining-the-michael-flynn-conviction-is-exfbi-agent-2020-02-17) to look into claims of withheld evidence in February of 2020. This US Attorney was able to identify withheld *Brady* material in only two months despite coming in cold and not knowing where the figurative bodies were buried. Yet in just that time, the case went from Flynn having a long-shot to withdraw his plea to the DOJ pulling up stakes entirely.

Clarification: the Flynn prosecution was brought by the [office of the Special Counsel](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4318155/Flynn-Plea-Agreement.pdf) - AKA Mueller and his team. The attorney who was in charge of the Flynn prosecution- Brandon Van Grack- was a [member of Mueller's team](https://www.pli.edu/faculty/brandon-l.-van-grack-23163) and continued in charge of Flynn's case after the Special Counsel's investigation wound down although Van Grack is nominally in the DOJ. So it wasn't the DOJ proper that was running the Flynn investigation, but rather the Office of the Special Counsel, but the DOJ is responsible for the Special Counsel's actions.

,"I think you are misunderstanding something.

In this case, the goal is not to protect the healthcare system; even if overwhelmed, the healthcare system would likely continue to exist though some hard ethical decisions would likely have to be made to allocate limited resources, [such as is happening in Italy](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-27/coronavirus-doctor-cremona-hospital-decide-who-lives-and-dies/12090912).

The goal is to protect lives as a whole. Here is one of many simple explanations of [the curve-flattening strategy](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and how it aims to do that. In short, we don't really change the *total* number of cases and infected, but we do change the peak amount of concurrent infections. This eliminates or at least reduces pressures on resources at that time, resulting in fewer deaths due to insufficient resources, and also giving time for preparation of additional capacity where needed.

The initial strategy was isolation, which seeks to exclude infection from the country, also patently a lifesaving measure, since people who aren't infected of something can't die from it. In other words, it would be difficult to say that the goal was *ever* about preserving a healthcare system rather than public health.

So the strategy goal hasn't shifted.

Some confusing parts about your post:

* ""Now, as leaders are considering reopening their economies, the issue is not usually framed as a method of preserving *systems,* but rather as a balance between reviving the economy and saving *lives.*"" What's the but rather for? Do you not think the economy is a system whose preservation is the goal of lifting of quarantine restrictions? This is a confusing sentence and it's also hard to see how this is relevant to your question which specifically references the goal of protecting a public health service rather than the larger system of the economy.
* The Supreme Court opinion you have referenced ([DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeShaney_v._Winnebago_County#Court_opinion)) also is questionably applicable at best. It references the state's responsibility to ensure the right to liberty without due process. Since the boy who was harmed by his father was not harmed/restricted as a result of direct state action such as arrest/incarceration, the opinion is that due process does not apply. Similarly, if you die of the pandemic, it's not the state violating your due process rights unless something truly unimaginable has happened, such as your state has done something like arrest you, infect you, and then let you die in jail without fair trial indicating that should be your fate.",katherinesilens,,gdj6og,fpip49d
,"The purpose of flattening the curve is to limit exposure so as to not overwhelm the healthcare system. But the reason not to overwhelm the healthcare system is to stymie deaths that would otherwise have been prevented. 

As with any other circumstance, we can reasonably debate limits and assumptions.

I'm pretty time-constrained, so I'll leave readers with a [recent paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27102.pdf) showing that a total-shutdown imposes a massive economic cost while only yielding a marginal benefit over restricting the stay-at-home order for the most vulnerable.

There's a [web tool](https://mr-sir.herokuapp.com/main) to visualize the results of the study.

The IMHE study has been rightly lambasted for greatly overstating the risk. Now that we better understand who is vulnerable and who is likely to be unaffected, we can start to reopen with a finer comb of restrictions.",Jefftopia,,gdj6og,fpjv46e
,"I find the ""protecting services"" framing confusing. This is because ""flattening the curve"" is a vast oversimplification: [to truly spread out the cases would mean extending the epidemic over a decade, based on some back-of-the-envelope calculations](https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727). This doesn't even take into consideration basic modeling issues, like [the epidemic curve being skewed to the right rather than being bell-shaped](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/455202/is-the-covid-19-pandemic-curve-a-gaussian-curve), which means that cases are ""front-loaded"" in the early stages of the epidemic. More importantly, reducing the slope of the curve is [functionally similar to reducing transmission rate](https://www.wired.com/story/the-promising-math-behind-flattening-the-curve/), with the added (important, in my opinion) proviso that reducing transmission rate doesn't imply spreading the same number of cases over a longer period of time that flattening the curve does. 

Thus, framing public health measures as ""protecting the health system"" is an inherently unrealistic frame of communicating the necessity and feasibility of public health measures.

That being said, let's parse the justification of Michigan's [stay-at-home order](https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90705-522626--,00.html):

>To suppress the spread of COVID-19, to prevent the state’s health care system from being overwhelmed, to allow time for the production of critical test kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment, and to avoid needless deaths, it is reasonable and necessary to direct residents to remain at home or in their place of residence to the maximum extent feasible.

While it does mention ""preventing the health care system from being overwhelmed"", it's clear from Governor Whitmer's message that her primary consideration in declaring a lockdown was to ""[prevent and prepare for the spread of this disease](https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90705-521576--,00.html)"". 

The lock down order additionally states:

>Similarly, the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of 1945, provides that, after declaring a state of emergency, “the governor may promulgate reasonable orders, rules, and regulations as he or she considers necessary to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation within the affected area under control.""

As such, this is an instance where a positive state law has been cited by the Governor that explicitly details a duty by the state chief executive to protect life. 

Secondarily, the CDC argues that the [Commerce Clause provides government with the justification to impose quarantines for people seeking to cross states or to enter the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html). 

Assuming that the [role of public health is to protect populations](https://www.cdcfoundation.org/what-public-health), it's philosophically inconsistent to hold that government does not have a responsibility to protect individual lives while at the same time maintaining that the government has a duty (and the corresponding police power) to protect population health, regardless if the point of the intervention is to reduce transmission or to ensure that health services remain available. Bandes [argues](https://cyber.harvard.edu/vaw00/bandes.html):

>Perhaps it is common ground that the distinction between action and inaction is malleable. Even Judge Easterbrook, a zealous opponent of requiring affirmative duties, admits that ""it is possible to restate most actions as corresponding inactions with the same effect, and to show that inaction may have the same effects as a forbidden action. Especially in light of their fluidity, the question should be why these distinctions are important; what purpose they are meant to serve. In the context of this discussion, the question is what the
distinctions are asked to accomplish in the constitutional realm.",MemberOfMautenGroup,,gdj6og,fpiv1we
,">The stated goal was to ""flatten the curve,"" so that even if many people got sick, they wouldn't all get sick at once, thereby keeping the total cases at any one time within the capacity of area hospitals.

>So, I'm wondering if the goals have shifted from protecting a public health service to protecting the general public health, or if those are functionally the same.

These two are the same thing. You seem to be under the assumption that ""keeping the total cases at any one time within the capacity of area hospitals"" was the goal in and of itself. If health systems exceed capacity, doctors will literally be put into a position of choosing who will receive treatment and who will be allowed to die, as we saw in Italy.

What I took from it was that the initial shutdowns are too flatten the curve and prevent shortages, the next motivation was how do you respond to shortages, and the final motivation is to reopen the economy without rising the shortages you were trying to avoid in the first place. Right now in many states we are just starting to flatten the curve and the government doesn't want to risk the sacrifices made so far by reopening too early and without a way of catching it quicker this time.",psychicsword,,gdj6og,fpixyth

This is no different from the Somalian government stealing food sent by the United Nations and cartels selling it illegally. [(11)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/10/aid-somalia-stolen-un-report)

Except in this situation FEMA is the cartels and the banana republic is the United States.

Also regarding Trump removing the watchdog overseeing the $2 trillion coronavirus bill? In 1998 the Supreme Court ruled line item vetos are unconstitutional. [(12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York)

His excuse? The Take Care Clause. And the Take Care Clause just says the President can't make his underlings do stuff that's against the law. It underscores that the executive is under a duty to faithfully execute the laws of Congress and not disregard them. [(13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution)

If you don't know what that's about, Trump wrote a signing statement (basically functionally a line item veto except the next President could undo it, but by then it'd be too late) into the stimulus bill that he was going to ignore the oversight provisions in the bill and do it himself. [(14)](https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/03/trump-says-hell-ignore-key-oversight-provision-in-stimulus-bill-1/) Either way, the Take Care Clause makes it illegal. 

According to Bradley and Posner, since the president is actually obligated under the “Take Care Clause” to comply with the constitution, “if the president believes that a statute violates the constitution, he has a constitutional obligation not to enforce it” (Bradley and Posner: 358).[(16)](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1411&context=etd) The opposite also holds true (see citation 13).",TiffanyGaming,,gbl0fu,fp8b4wr

,"Based on the tweet, what Cotton is proposing is to refuse to issue visas for Chinese students to come to the United States and study STEM subjects.  This is definitely legal.  The legality of a policy prohibiting Chinese nationals otherwise legally present with appropriate status in the United States (e.g., green card holders) from studying STEM subjects is less clear.

There is no right to receive a visa, and the doctrine of ""[consular nonreviewability](https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/conference/ilroundtable/ILR13_DIDonaldDobkinChallengingtheDoctrine.pdf)"" prevents a foreign national from even challenging a visa denial in court.   There is no ambiguity whatsoever that Congress can restrict immigration on the basis of national origin -- in fact, this is probably the most common form of restriction over the course of American history.  The Supreme Court, for example, repeatedly upheld the Chinese Exclusion Act (prohibiting all immigration to the United States by Chinese individuals).

In *Chae Chan Ping v. United States,* the court [held](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep130/usrep130581/usrep130581.pdf):

>That the government of the United States, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy.

Congress has also delegated to the president the authority to exclude aliens at his own discretion under [8 U. S. C. §1182(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182):

Again, no ambiguity here.  The president could by proclamation tomorrow announce a restriction (no visas for STEM students) on a class of aliens (people from China) merely on the basis of a finding that their entry would be detrimental to the United States.

It's less clear what would apply to Chinese nationals already otherwise legally present in the US (especially green card holders).  Such individuals are in a much different legal posture, and I can't imagine off the top of my head what authority you would attempt to use.

For another, [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton), one of the authors of the Federalist Papers, was born in the British West Indies. Many of America's greatest minds have been first or second generation immigrants.

In practice, this means the act basically applies to all colleges in the country. Colleges preventing students from attending courses solely based on their national origin (them being Chinese) is illegal under the act.

That being said, I could not find any statute in federal law or any case-law precedent which prevents colleges from discriminating based on immigration status itself (there are statutes prohibiting this for employment process), which means colleges could refuse to sponsor visas for all applicants to STEM courses, or maybe even refuse to admit non-citizens altogether. This, in itself, is not discriminating based on national origin since it relates to immigration status rather than specific places where someone is from or what their ethnic background is [(EEOC)](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/nationalorigin.cfm).

,"All they'd need is Level C HAZMAT protection. The OSHA requirements for Level C protection are a full-facepiece, air-purifying, canister-equipped respirator, chemical resistant gloves and safety boots, two-way communications system and hard hat. [(1)](https://www.natlenvtrainers.com/blog/article/hazmat-protection-levels)[(2)](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.120AppB)

Basically, a full face mask with P100 canisters and gloves would suffice. Or a half facepiece with goggles and gloves. N95/N100 masks would also work with goggles but best to not create any more demand for those.

Then the masks, gloves, and goggles would need to be decontaminated. It'd ideally be done in a ""clean"" room with airflow cut off from the rest of the work areas to ensure any infectious agents are not present in the room. Then the room decontaminated before the next person uses it. Portable clean tents are pretty [readily available.](http://www.ceramisis.com/inflatable_cleanroom.htm)

They'd leave the facility distanced away from anyone that could infect them once the protections are removed. Though they should probably be instructed to wear surgical masks out to their cars just in case they're infected so it doesn't potentially spread, despite best efforts.

Something like Level B & A would not be necessary whatsoever and speaking from experience... working all day in one of those like in a BSL-4 lab, it's not something you'd want to do for an 8 hour day every day with manual labor. The positive pressure suits can get kinda hot and having to pee or eat or drink, kind of a problem. And it requires [a lot of infrastructure in place.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level#/media/File:Structure_of_NIAID_Integrated_Research_Facility.jpg)

Ideally they need to take employee temperatures ever day and check for symptoms. If they're presenting they should be sent for testing. Though ideally employees would be regularly tested using rapid tests that can provide results in 5 minutes on-site like [what Abbott's working on.](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rapid-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-provide-results-minutes/story?id=69875037)

Whatever the case, they'd also need training for proper protection procedures.

The biggest risk in such a situation wouldn't even be in the workplace necessarily but what the workers do and/or are exposed to outside the workplace. If they aren't self-isolating then they could end up interacting with someone that's infected and if they go back to work then they're infecting other workers. Thus they'd need procedures in place to prevent worker to worker transmission. Once they're geared up it's fine but they also have to work out the whole them getting inside thing. There are already procedures and guidelines for various workplaces that require such things.

,"So the basis for most of their decisions is that airlines accepting the grant money must maintain service to anywhere they were servicing as of March 1st 2020. Some of this is heavy handed as airlines have seasonal routes that they were serving on [March 1st](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/covid-19-update-us-senate-passes-61-billion-relief-package-aviation-industry), that they typically drop come the spring and summer (think ski country). Now the airlines will be forced to fly those routes throughout the summer (definitely at a loss) if they accept grant money. So far they’ve [denied](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOT-OST-2020-0037-0069) most of these requests. 

Additionally, airlines have been able to have fairly wide latitude as to how they go about maintaining service. If they use to serve Chicago from both New York and Seattle, they’ll allow airlines to drop one or the other so long as Chicago still has service. They’ll also allow the airline to use [through flights](https://crankyflier.com/2020/04/09/alaska-jetblue-get-creative-to-satisfy-government-stimulus-requirements/) and fly New York to Chicago to Seattle instead of separate flights from New York to Chicago and New York to Seattle. 

Lastly, they’ve allowed the airlines to [consolidate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/04/08/jetblue-suspending-flights-eight-airports-new-york-laguardia-baltimore/2968917001/) service in metro areas that are served by multiple airports. So instead of serving Kennedy, Newark, and La Guardia in New York, they can simply fly to one of the three.

Recently, they have issued further guidance that allows airlines with under 10% market share to drop routes that are to or from hub cities that are served by other airlines. So if I flew from New York to Charlotte, and Charlotte is a hub for a major airline, then I can petition for relief for this route since it’s still being served by someone else.

To answer your second question, it really depends on what the routes are. Assuming it’s purely domestic, not overwater, already an airline certificated under 14CFR121, and there’s no capacity restrictions at either airport then it’s a matter of filing some paperwork with the FAA and beginning service. Outside of those conditions it gets significantly more complicated.

>Bankruptcy, by contrast, is a legal process in which a judge decides which debts will be paid, in what order, and in what amount. Under the Constitution, bankruptcy is a power entirely reserved to the federal government. An American bankruptcy is overseen in federal court, by a federal judge, according to federal law. That’s why federal law can allow U.S. cities to go bankrupt, as many have done over the years. That’s why the financial restructuring of Puerto Rico can be overseen by a federal control board.

,">How have States resolved serious financial crises? 

State financial crises are generally revenue shortfalls, not inability to repay debt like bankruptcy would imply. The state with the highest dollar amount of debt is California, with a state debt of $153 billion or about 5% of its gdp. States have resolved revenue shortfalls by increasing bond sales, increasing taxes, reducing spending, or receiving federal aid. 

Suggesting that states should declare bankruptcy is implying the existence of a very different problem than the one that exists in reality. Of course, declaring bankruptcy would result in a very small net revenue increase, but there's simply not a reason why defaulting on debt payments would be a place to look for an additional couple percentage points of increased revenue.

,"Short answer: yes, it is constitutional.

Long answer: if the states are doing it, not trying to seek an impermissible purpose, and have a rational basis for their action, it's kosher.  If it was a national order, it would be much more difficult.

In the US Constitutional scheme, there are effectively two ways for something to be unconstitutional:

*  **Something can be unconstitutional if it violates a specific constitutional right.**  The Constitution establishes certain rights which all persons enjoy, and which government cannot violate without very good reason.  So for example, the [first amendment right to free speech,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) and the [8th amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment)

  I can't think of a specific enumerated right that a mask requirement violates. Perhaps one could make a general free expression argument that it curtails expression, but that seems fairly weak.  The courts [have upheld bans on public nudity against first amendment challenges](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13977097322948440019&q=first+amendment+public+nudity&hl=en&as_sdt=3,33) and this would seem to be a far stronger case than a general public nudity ban - the requirement to wear a mask is aimed at [protection of public health and safety.](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/31/compelling-state-interest)  Preserving human life in the face of a massive threat from a novel and deadly disease is possibly one of the easiest compelling government interest cases there is.  And that comports with the broader legal principle that almost [every other facet of law](https://www.justia.com/criminal/defenses/necessity/) will bend to prevent injury and death when needed.  Given such a strong compelling interest, and assuming the mask law is tailored narrowly (e.g. just requiring masks in public places where risk is highest), even under [the highest levels of scrutiny](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny) this would pass muster. 

* **Something can be unconstitutional if it exceeds the government's powers.**  Separate from violating a particular individual right, a law can be unconstitutional if it exceeds the government's jurisdiction.  This almost always comes up in the context of the Federal government.  State governments possess the [""police power""](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/police_powers) to make whatever laws are necessary for general welfare.  In contrast, the Federal government only has [the powers specifically listed in the US Constitution, and all federal actions must be based on one of those powers.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment)

While the specifics differ from state constitution to [state constitution](https://codes.findlaw.com/il/chapter-20-executive-branch/il-st-sect-20-3305-7.html), a state of emergency declaration allows the state to effectively switch to some form of [martial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law). Martial law is effectively military law. Not necessarily ""law imposed by the military"", but how the military operates. As an example, in the military your entire daily life is run by the authorities: where you sleep, what you eat, what you say, etc. A state in martial law can do the same, if necessary. In most cases, the use of a state of emergency and martial law don't go that far, instead the declaration puts into motion certain administrative policies, like allowing the state to dip into an otherwise off-limits emergency fund. But state of emergency martial law powers have been used in [a number of important instances in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_the_United_States) ranging from natural disasters to riots.

The crucial difference between the US and perhaps other countries in their use of martial law is that in the US, military cannot be used without federal congressional approval. The states however have access to their national guards, which serve the governor. Additionally, martial law does not suspend habeas corpus, and that civilian courts will be used and not military courts.

All this to say that under the context of a state of emergency, the traditional concept of constitutionality doesn't fully apply and yes governors can require, under penalty of law enforcement, the use of face masks while outdoors.",zethien,,g4ugpb,fnzwkku

,"With Constitutional law, the answer is always “it depends.” It depends a lot on the structure of the suit, including the specific law challenged, the situation in which that law was challenged, and what is alleged to be wrong with it. That said, here are some things that may be issues:

Dormant commerce clause/commerce clause:

State actions that affect interstate commerce are beyond what the state is allowed to regulate. If challenged on these grounds, the argument may be along the lines of state regulations being overly burdensome on businesses that cross state lines. 

 Source: Wickard v. Filburn, the quintessential Dormant Commerce Clause case - https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/317us111

Supremacy Clause:

If the Federal government says one thing and a state says another, the federal government wins. Challenge on these grounds would likely be along the lines of “Federal Government said to reopen, states said not to.” This seems to be a direction AG Barr may go based on recent comments (take your pick on sources for these comments, here’s one 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nationalreview.com/news/ag-barr-says-the-doj-may-take-legal-action-against-states-if-lockdowns-are-deemed-excessive/amp/). A consequence of the supremacy clause is that States may not take action that directly interferes with Federal action. Quintessential case on this is Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/14us304, though Marbury v. Madison is also on point https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/5us137.

These are the two most likely challenges to be successful IMO, though there are definitely more.

Notably, a CT lawyer has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of Governor Ned Lamont’s recent executive orders (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fox61.com/amp/article/news/health/coronavirus/stamford-lawyer-challenges-gov-lamonts-masks-order/520-f54d920c-46a8-4a98-912f-4c34b91c8ebc). The allegations include due process violations and first amendment (unconstitutionally broad “enabling“ legislation, interfering with right to protest) issues, among others. A possible outcome is that the district court rules that to the extent the enabling statute allows the actions taken, it is unconstitutionally broad. Whether that fits the bill of the governor’s actions being unconstitutional is another story though.

Whether something is “constitutional” is kind of a hard question. These cases are so fact specific that all anyone can do is guess. In my personal opinion, we are living a future Constitutional Law case. Which way it goes, however, is anyone’s guess.",Aaahbeees,,g4ugpb,fo4z13i

,"If you're only looking for US studies, the word you're going to find most commonly is ""inconclusive.""  RAND conducted a [recent review](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/key-findings/what-science-tells-us-about-the-effects-of-gun-policies.html) of what they deem high quality studies using plausibly causal designs (i.e., designed to look for cause-effect relationships and not just correlations).

They find strong evidence (defined as ""Three studies found significant effects in the same direction using at least two independent data sets, and contradictory evidence was not found in other studies with equivalent or stronger methods."") that:

* Child access prevention laws reduce firearm self-injuries including suicides overall.
* Child access prevention laws reduce unintentional firearm deaths and injuries *among children.*

RAND finds moderate evidence in four other areas (""Two or more studies found significant effects in the same direction, and contradictory evidence was not found in other studies with equivalent or stronger methods.""):

* Background checks decrease suicides
* Background checks decrease firearm homicides
* Prohibitions on gun ownership for mental-health reasons decrease violent crime in general
* Stand-your-ground laws (laws that eliminate the ""duty to retreat"" before using force in self defense) increase homicides and limited evidence shows that they increase gun homicides in particular.

The remainder of the areas they assess feature either limited or inconclusive evidence.

So why is the quality of the evidence so poor?

1. It's generically difficult to estimate causal effects of public policies because randomized controlled trials and the like are exceptionally rare and observational data usually involves *massive* selection problems.
2. Changes in gun policies mostly affect the flow of guns (who can obtain a new gun) rather than the stock of guns (all of the guns already in circulation).  Guns last a long time, and the stock is large relative to the flow, so we should expect the effect of most policy interventions to be small.
3. Guns can readily cross subnational borders, so changes in state/local regulations can often be easily circumvented.  With national policy changes, there is no way to identify a ""control"" group and get causal evidence.
4. There are [big problems](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/key-findings/what-science-tells-us-about-the-effects-of-gun-policies.html) with the data on guns which are unusually unreliable in comparison to similar data.
5. For political reasons, it is difficult to do research on guns.  Congress has restricted the use of federal research dollars for studying the topic.  In consequence, gun violence is the [least researched](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2595514) cause of death relative to the death toll.  By one metric, given the death toll, you would expected $1.4 billion in federal funding for research on gun violence, but the actual total is less than 2% of that ($22 million).

So, if you really want to understand guns, you probably have to go global though this does not solve many of the problems listed above.  If your interest is in the US, this can also be problematic to the extent you think the American context is unique.

[A recent (2015) review](https://watermark.silverchair.com/mxv012.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlwwggJYBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJJMIICRQIBADCCAj4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMzmMpJPpDPgKbS9aEAgEQgIICD8RRMnK5n4XMVpDORehVlAMe0FIWaaX81q7eWlgrEkZEbYUOgc80n6lWpsP0cTxVwboeMjQHhahmgaGDoyuxzsVOWyVd-Az-YxC5eBJ_ygziGxST0Q6wrkqHTxSV29DlVRcDWdEpD51B9gKQ9FQqoFuoIdzwqdRWSqmuIamSBgGBoSE2jzoNJBptFc6vR49V6PPtarvhO9NkJGnX9zzKcuwm8lA0NdeGunx7iBUv-2RP8G4Pi3EFh-DNKor58RqWl-SHJl2_fOLMNxiQor5aFq8ATTGfFZ6s9nn6zEuF2Ijouj_gbZkFyqvYdmCnZMokvwgoOoF26eNrtsixjHOOSItfNuilaYrKX_xnyjKMWh6itO5rWu0-NA9pIuO8868C-ijcc1PU2xG9Rsc-OLI8dC6IEc5ezK5qihfDQ8_H3niNb0J8jLCjvf8Mgu4_pnW3y2Jj220pyM75pjJt_4VK3NbsVAOYvJ8c6djZ60NukDV3eOcWP-u6eps9M9ZqxMqSxElW-AIXVzsJk82izLikrpY4_mkahnxr-v3EpaJ36kn33sji9gij1CpdRnyObh1nkxaBp7CB9vTsL9GGQ6ILEKb63TkUOVtus2EcADdnio3FF-aSPRGFyJjSmpRCHClZUPsXbPCPAB8mWFd0aM2_uoEw8kj3Pb5BFirNpQGLsCJCFPxVJ2nI8JueK-ctbCxG) analyzed 130 studies from 10 countries to get global leverage on guns.  In many global cases, firearms restrictions involve the simultaneous enactment of several different gun control policies, which makes it difficult to isolate the effects of particular measures.  The author's big picture conclusions are:

* ""The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple elements of firearms regulations reduced firearm-related deaths in certain countries.""
* ""Some specific restrictions on purchase, access, and use of firearms are associated with reduction in firearms deaths""

On the second point, they particularly identify ""compelling evidence"" for reductions in violence from background check laws, child access restriction laws, banning the carrying of firearms on certain days and for increases in violence from stand-your-ground laws.

The review authors note the various problems with inferential research in this area and also specifically note that bias may distort results because many studies are funded by advocates or opponents.

TL;DR: Strong evidence shows that background checks and child access restrictions reduce violence and ""stand your ground"" laws increase it.  There are big challenges to good inferential research that limit our ability to answer other questions related to gun restrictions.

Edit: Someone asked below about the definition of stand-your-ground (and the comment appears to have been deleted but I think the term is not necessarily clear).  In the underlying studies, this [refers](https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/stand-your-ground/violent-crime.html) to laws that ""remove the duty to retreat in some place outside the home.""  The duty to retreat is the obligation to avoid using force in self-defense if you can protect yourself by retreating rather than using force.

,"Some things to consider:
[The US Homicide rate has been on a steady overall decline since 1991 according to the FBI crime statistics](https://letgrow.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/graph-crime-rate-1990-to-2018-USE-THIS-it-is-bigger.png) and many sources have taken credit for it, including but not limited to; [Abortion being legalized, an uptick in incarceration rates, increased hiring of police, the decrease of restrictive gun ownership laws,  a larger elderly population, the rise of technology keeping more people inside, overall economic prosperity, and many many more factors.](https://www.vox.com/2015/2/13/8032231/crime-drop)

My point is that the homicide rate, like any other big number, does not exist in a vacuum, and its hard to draw any one factor that is causing general decline or increase. We should also consider that no source is immune to self interest, and as a politician would like you to attribute any decrease in the homicide rate to a particular bill being passed, gun owners likewise would like you to attribute it to the idea that criminals won't want to invade homes if they think a gun owner lives there.

We should also consider that people in general are more prone to [believe that things are getting worse, not better, regardless of the fact that they are indeed getting better](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/14/most-americans-incorrectly-think-gun-homicides-have-gotten-worse-not-better/)

We should also consider the language that is commonly used in this debate to describe gun violence and gun deaths as opposed to gun homicides, [the former 2 of which, include suicides, witch make up two thirds of all gun related deaths.](https://everytownresearch.org/firearm-suicide/)

**In short: you won't find any non heavily biased sources tying gun related deaths being either positively or negatively affected by legislation as they have to account for countless other factors that are impossible to account for.** That said, those are my interpretations of the the statistics I have sourced, please do look into what I have linked and make your own conclusions.",zeekgb,,g4hftb,fnzkgku
,"Here is a study from last year that suggests that universal background checks and laws that prevent those convicted of violent misdemeanors from obtaining guns are the laws most associated with a reduction in firearm-related homicides: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-019-04922-x](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-019-04922-x)

One of the difficult things about analyzing gun laws is that places with a lot of gun crime are more likely to implement restrictions.  This study compares the same place over time, before and after the implementation of different laws.",econerino,,g4hftb,fnz996g
,"I'd argue that you've (most likely inadvertently) spoiled the question from the start by framing it specifically in terms of ""gun homicides"".

[From Wikipedia's page for Homicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide):

> Homicide is the act of one human killing another.[1] A homicide requires only a volitional act by another person that results in death, and thus a homicide may result from accidental, reckless, or negligent acts even if there is no intent to cause harm.[2] Homicides can be divided into many overlapping legal categories, including murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, killing in war (either following the laws of war or as a war crime), euthanasia, and capital punishment, depending on the circumstances of the death. These different types of homicides are often treated very differently in human societies; some are considered crimes, while others are permitted or even ordered by the legal system.

In other words, homicide refers to a person killing another person, even if that killing would be considered an unfortunate necessity that prevents worse harm.

To really illustrate the problem with counting ""gun homicides"", consider the following: Imagine a murderous rapist with a knife.  If his would-be victim has a lawfully carried gun, and uses it to defend herself, we would most likely end up with a justifiable gun homicide.  But if we examine the same situation under a gun ban, we would likely have a rape and knife-based murder.  Looking solely at the number of gun homicides would make the gun ban seem preferable, even though it actually results in more crime and more harm to innocent, law-abiding citizens.

So a better metric would instead involve looking at the overall violent crime rate.  This has other problems due to all the other potential factors involved in crime.  For example, the [lead-crime hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis) speculates that the crime drop in the '90s comes from children in the '70s being exposed to less environmental lead vs. prior generations.

I realize I wrote quite a bit to ultimately reach a conclusion of, ""I've got no clue,"" but I feel these points are still important because they also address why other attempts to answer the question should be taken with a grain of salt.",ErasmusDarwin,,g4hftb,fnzeed0
,"I think it would be better to consider all homicides, as a honest comparison would show if banning firearms lead to less violent death overall. If your society transitions from people getting shot to people getting stabbed, I'm not sure that is really progress.

Considering the U.S. & Australia, the murder rate is 5.3 vs 0.8 according to [this Wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate)

So clearly the U.S. has more violence. But violence is not the only factor to consider for gun laws. That disregards political freedom and self-determination, not to mention sporting. Also, you cannot regulate human behavior, think of the prohibition of alcohol.

Also, Chicago does have very strict laws, and a high murder rate. That Politifact Article spends the majority of its bulk discussing why Chicago's strict gun laws are not the *most* strict in the nation. It should rate his statement as mostly true.",Darklance,,g4hftb,fnzb5fz

,">For the sake of this discussion, let's go with USA gun laws.

For the ""sake of discussion"", it's arguably meaningless to go with USA gun laws since the outsize power of gun proponents in that country have ensured that no matter what gun control legislation is enacted in a given city or state, it's always undermined by the fact that the surrounding counties, or next state along has NOT enacted any such controls, [thereby blunting any effect gun control might have had.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Gilroy-Garlic-Festival-shooting-Gun-illegally-14209134.php)

Furthermore, this line of reasoning is essentially just another example of the common American gun proponent view - typically unsubstantiated - that seeks to argue that American gun violence  issues cannot be explained or mitigated, much less placed in comparison to anywhere else, [because the USA is exceptional in virtually every respect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/about-thinking/201802/guns-versus-american-exceptionalism): America has more people than anywhere else on the planet. America is the only country that borders Mexico (which is the only country on the planet with a widespread drug cartel problem). Only America has gangs or people with mental illnesses. And so on and so forth. Some even go so far as to claim that [actually everything is fine, since the only valid comparison is to how much of the population own guns.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3158214)

When you cite Chicago as a place to look at when evaluating the effects and effectiveness of gun control, I immediately think that is a great opportunity to look at this issue from the above viewpoint: I.e. What happens when you enact stringent gun controls, but the country around you does not.

Greater London has a population of almost 9 million people. Cook County has just over half that. Both cities encapsulate a wide cross section of the demographics of the country as a whole, with pockets of great affluence alongside those of deep deprivation (two London boroughs are amongst the top ten most deprived areas in the entire UK). Issues with income inequality, drug abuse, mental health provision and violent crime are well documented in both cities - as you would expect in any large conurbation sharing those characteristics.

So bearing that in mind, why then does London, with a population double that of Chicago (and in fact, greater than every other US city - with only NYC equalling), have a homicide rate [that is so much lower](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/18/world/london-us-cities-homicide-rates-comparison-intl-gbr/index.html)? And this is just homicides. [Of homicides where guns were explicitly cited as a cause of death, that number was in 2019: 12.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/number-of-homicides-in-london-climbs-to-10-year-high) (It bears mentioning that the UK's rate of firearms deaths is [lower than even the oft-cited by gun proponents, Switzerland](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate).)Chicago by comparison saw [461 fatal shootings in 2019.](https://heyjackass.com/category/chicago-crime-2019/) And if I read my maps right, Chicago is nowhere near Mexico.

I would suggest that the first - obviously not the only, but the first - cause is that London is just one constituent part of a greater polity that has enacted *sensible gun control*, whereas Chicago is the exact opposite: *Some* gun control, but crucially surrounded by relative lawlessness. This should be at the very least enough to show what should be obvious - [that there actually is a way to prevent high incidences of gun crime irrespective of population size or proximity to cartel territory, and it starts with the political will to do so.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/%27No_Way_To_Prevent_This,%27_Says_Only_Nation_Where_This_Regularly_Happens)",themanifoldcuriosity,,g4hftb,fnzczb3

,"Obviously Trumps statements about the WHO are full of [falsehoods](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/factchecking-trumps-attack-on-the-who/).

  
The WHO is basically just a few smart guys in an office, who are trying their best to coordinate the response to a health crisis. They rely on the cooperation of their members. So when China tells them: ""Yeah this Virus thing isn't so bad"" - they could say: ""Well, you asholes are telling lies"" - but then China would probably stop cooperating with the WHO altogether, so they have to walk a very thin line, ensuring the cooperation of the member states, while also being very careful and diplomatic (which then makes them open to criticism of being too diplomatic). This makes sense, because we NEED the data from China, to understand the virus. Without the WHO forcing China to share data our first contact with the Virus would have been months later.

They also heavily rely on the member states to enact policies against the virus. They can only recommend stuff. For example they said: ""We shouldn't declare this a pandemic too soon"", because then member states [would say:](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-who/virus-can-still-be-beaten-too-early-to-declare-pandemic-who-idUSKCN20I0N8) ""Well, we can't stop a pandemic, so lets just do nothing.""

You can't have it [both ways](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52299820). You can't have an international body with no right to interfere in national sovereignty (a nationalist talking point) AND then criticize them, when they are so weak they have to bow to the nation states if they want their data or cooperation (another nationalist talking point).

And we need the WHO more than ever now. It makes zero sense if all countries now enact these wonderful social distancing policies and then don't coordinate on loosing the restrictions. Some countries will have excess resources while others might have to let people die because they lack them. They need a forum to discuss this sort of stuff, and that's what the WHO is for.

Trump did nothing for months to prepare for the pandemic, while other countries like South Korea or Germany had a much quicker and more effective response. The fact that many countries DID manage to respond in time shows, that the WHO probably couldn't have done such a bad job after all.",mysteryhumpf,,g1wgm7,fnl4thl

,"So the first thing that comes to mind is how the USPS makes sure to maintain daily rural deliveries.  [FedEx](https://www.reveelgroup.com/fedex-smartpost/) and other parcel services will actually have the USPS deliver packages to locations far away from their delivery centers.  They will transport the package as far as they view as feasible and then have a Post Office deliver it to the individual.  If profit became the main motive of the USPS, it seems unlikely that they would maintain daily deliveries to these locations.

Next, would probably be cut post offices.  To make money, it would make sense to look at individual offices in terms of profit generation.  A low performing office would likely be cut or joined with another office.

If this happened it wouldn't necessarily make sense to allow the USPS to have a [monopoly](https://fee.org/articles/an-expert-explains-the-postal-monopoly/) over letter delivery.  If they were no longer making daily deliveries and weren't a state owned enterprise, why would they deserve to be the only organization allowed to deliver letters?

Possible pros I can think of are the simple things that come from increased competition. Improved customer service, less lost deliveries, etc.

Edit: Grammar",ScoopskiPotatoes78,,g06jzo,fn8g06p
,"1) How does privatization actually work?

There are a few types of privatization including:

a) Complete Privatization - this is pretty rare in the US. In this case, the USPS can be sold in a variety of ways, including shares, its assets ( the trucks, post offices, etc.) or by divested into shares and distributed to the people. The government can also attach certain responsibilities and obligations, such as continuing to fulfill the purpose of the bought post office (instead of tearing it down and building condos, as an example).

b) Privatization of Operations - In this case, a private company takes the responsibility of the government and makes profit by delivering a direct fee to the user - in this case, you would no longer pay taxes to fund the USPS.  Instead, you would just pay a fee to have mail delivered to you by whichever company picked up the obligation.

c) Contracting -  Here, the government simply keeps a fund and pays companies to do its work. You would still be paying taxes to the government, presumably less if the private company is more efficient. Note that the government can charge you fees to maintain this fund (garbage collection is a common example of this BTW).

d)  Franchising - in this case, the rights to do what the USPS did are broken up by region and given to differant firms to hold monopolies in. Your utilities, such as power, water and garbage are all examples of this. (It is not conductive to have competing power delivery systems and garbage has low margins). Note this is a subset of c.

e) Open Competition  - The governments halts the operations of the USPS and hopes they are picked up for profit by other companies. We probably would not see this because the USPS has obligations which are objectively not profitable

What are the benefits and downsides of privatizing the USPS? 

In general, the major upside of privatization is that we taxpayers save money! The downsides of privatization is the risk. The endeavor may not prove profitable enough to be sustained. It may not actually be cheaper for the taxpayers even if cheaper for the government if a fee system is used. Take the Indiana toll road for example. 

> The Indiana Toll Road, which is 157 miles long and runs along the states northern border, was leased for 75 years at a cost of $3.85 billion. These amounts equaled to approximately 40 times revenues and 60 times operating profits.  

 Flexibility, timeliness and expertise are all qualities which can be expensive to maintain. If too expensive, private entities can fall short of their contract obligations.

Sourcing:  [http://cgfa.ilga.gov/Upload/2006Gov\_Privatization\_Rprt.pdf](http://cgfa.ilga.gov/Upload/2006Gov_Privatization_Rprt.pdf) 

2) How would it affect the USPS itself?

The USPS has powers it would lose from no longer being a part of the government, including

>• It can borrow up to $15 billion from the U.S. Treasury at low interest rates.  
>  
>• It is exempt from state and local sales, income, and property taxes; parking tickets; vehicle fees; and other charges.  
>  
>• It pays federal corporate income taxes on its earnings from competitive products, but those taxes are circulated back to the USPS.[1](https://www.cato.org/publications/cato-journal/restructuring-us-postal-service#fn09-1)  
>  
>• It is not bound by local zoning laws, is immune from a range of civil actions, and has the power of eminent domain.  
>  
>• It has government regulatory power, which it can use to impede competitors.

As a private company, it would immediately lose those powers, which give it an innate advantage against it competition. However, it also has an import set of obligations which **do not bring in a profit and would likely be dropped by private entities if allowed, such as** 

* Running post offices which it does not profit on
* The Universal Service obligation
*  Last mile delivery service 

The Universal Service obligation is a big deal - the USPS is obligated to deliver mail to anyone within 6 days. You can live in the bottom of the grand canyon, and as long as you have a listed address, you will be delivered to. It also acts to regulate mail prices, keeping them low (despite less and less mail volume, effectively subsidizing them). 

The last mile delivery service obligates the USPS to deliver packages to end locations which private entities cannot deliver to as quickly.

A much bigger deal would be for USPS employees, who maintain both collective bargaining rights and incredibly good healthcare. Less than 7% of America's workforce has collective bargaining rights, implying the USPS workforce would follow the same trend. The USPS is also unique in that it funds medical care to each employee straight after hire for their entire career. This is an incredibly good and unique deal to the employee.

3) How would it affect ordinary people like myself? 

Depends where you live. First off the universal.

* Less junk mail

The USPS helps keep junk mail possible by keeping mailing costs down. Junk mail is now the most common type of mail in the US, while actual mail (letters, bills and the like) drop each year. 

* Suspension of service/increase of service rates for rural populations

Its been a long debate whether or not rural routes can be profitable delivery centers. The bottom 4,500 post offices only get 4.4 visits a day on average. Its objectively clear that rural rates are not profitable on current margins, so costs would have to go up significantly in these areas.

* Less taxes

Note I did not say less in fees/total. As it stands, the excellent wages federal post workers make along with the benefits is superior to what private delivery drivers make. We do pay for that at the end of the day. 

* Letter services decreasing

Most European countries privatized their post systems, and their private companies responded to the drop in letter profits by decreasing letter services. That includes no more seven day delivery and slower letter speeds.

Main points:

1. This is not anything to do with mail in voting. This is the second time I've seen this mentioned. In the event a state or federal government implemented mail in voting they would secure a service to deliver those ballots, whether it is USPS or some other carrier. As a similarity, the federal government wanted a website that could handle online census gathering, but it didn't build it itself, it hired a company to implement it. This happens all the time because private companies are good at a lot of things that are outside the domain of the federal government.

https://www.census.gov/about/business-opportunities/opportunities/vendor-opps/2014-10-15-2020-comm.html

2. Many other OECD countries have privatized mail carriers with success. America is a cautionary tale and somewhat backwards in this instance. 

3. Privitizing USPS means giving it the freedom to compete and succeed without the burden of being something like a heavily regulated private business. It also means giving the opportunity to competitors to step in and do better than USPS. You might see cheaper first class letter delivery and cheaper package delivery.

4. As a tax payer, you won't be asked to pay for the inefficiencies of a government department that generates billions of dollars but has structural issues tied to its governance model that leave it losing money every year. The post office loses money *even before accounting for its retirement funding*.

https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/368753-theres-more-than-one-reason-the-postal-service-is-losing-money

The downsides of privatization are...

1. USPS jobs will inevitably have worse total compensation. The level of compensation is what hurts USPS right now. In order to compete USPS will need to be more like other mail services.

2. You will likely see a lot of very small post offices close. These are post offices than serve < 5 people a day and are not well trafficked, but expensive to staff and maintain. 

3. You might see in some remote areas that letters are delivered every 2-3 days instead of every day.

4. Lack of monopoly power could mean a lot of competition for mail carrier services, which could have varying costs, service areas, and qualities, which can be confusing for people.",cougmerrik,,g06jzo,fn8ikfa

By the 3rd week of March when they saw the numbers were rising enough that community transmission was likely they gave 48hrs notice that they were shutting everything down and enforcing a strict lock down. The strategy was aimed at beyond flattening the curve and was directed at elimination. They ramped up their test capacity and focused specifically on contact tracing.

Only essential travel is allowed and only supermarkets,pharmacies and hospitals remain open. Everyone else must shut or work from home.

,"The legal claims in this letter are, frankly, absurd.

Firstly, as a threshold matter, the letter fails to adequately allege a false statement by PUSA.

The letter from Trump says:

>PUSA stitched together fragments from
multiple speeches by President Trump to fraudulently and maliciously imply that President Trump called
the coronavirus outbreak a “hoax.” 

The letter doesn't establish that the ad in fact makes that implication.  For example, a reasonable viewer of the ad could believe that ""their new hoax"" refers to Trump's claim in the next snippet about the Coronavirus saying ""we have it totally under control."" 

The ad is ambiguous because it says ""their hoax"" which is the accurate Trump quote.  

The Supreme Court in [Time, Inc. v. Pape](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15557260614517308191&q=defamation+ambiguous+statement&hl=en&as_sdt=3,33) held that in contexts such as these, ambiguous statements are not sufficient grounds for a defamation claim.  The case there turned on whether an alleged incident in a government report had actually happened:

>The deliberate choice of such an interpretation, though arguably reflecting a misconception, was not enough to create a jury issue of ""malice"" under New York Times. To permit the malice issue to go to the jury because of the omission of a word like ""alleged,"" despite the context of that word in the Commission Report and the external evidence of the Report's overall meaning, would be to impose a much stricter standard of liability on errors of interpretation or judgment than on errors of historic fact.

Even if the PUSA ad reflects a misconception or leads to a misconception among some viewers, as long as it is a possible good faith interpretation, protects it from being defamatory.

Further, the precedents cited in the Trump letter related to first amendment questions all predate the seminal case of [NY Times Co. v. Sullivan.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207&q=ny+times+vs+sullivan&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&as_vis=1)  _Sullivan_ is precisely on point to this, relating to a publisher's liability for an ad they ran which contained a false statement about a public official's official conduct and statements about that conduct.

The allegations in _Sullivan_ are much, much better for the plaintiffs than Trump's would be here.  There's a reason Trump doesn't cite any post-_Sullivan_ cases, and it's because the Supreme Court has said, very very clearly, that the Trump campaign's position is a dead dog loser.

Moreover, the only other citation to anything post-Sullivan actually adverse to a station owner is to [a case](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1649326515151092382&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr) about an FCC license being revoked, and that case has no plausible connection to this one.

Of that, $75 billion goes to the airline industry and the mysteriously named “businesses critical to national security.” The other $425 helps capitalize a $4.25 trillion, with a T, leveraged lending facility at the Federal Reserve. The taxpayer dollars would soak up any losses from that lending program. The loans won’t be secret anymore, but the oversight is largely after the fact, without subpoena power, and mainly reduced to writing reports.

The money cannon can therefore go to executive compensation or mergers or wholesale purchases of distressed businesses or whatever other financial engineering the accounting department can muster. And once the company returns to health, it can leak out cash to investors (and during the loan too, in dividends). There’s no requirement to keep workers hired; in fact, the (necessary) provision to boost unemployment insurance for four months to 100 percent of median salary (including furloughed workers, gig workers and freelancers) means that these companies can fire with relative impunity.

in traditional monetary theory the government creates a positive value, the cash it wants to spend, and negative value, the debt it now owes.  the debt is sold to provide the surplus, then the asymmetrical process of taxation is used to pay off the debt later.[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget-deficit.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget-deficit.asp)

In modern monetary theory, spending money itself creates money, the negative balance stays on the books. Issuing debt is a way to soften the impact of injecting this money into the economy by removing an amount now and feeding it in later. taxation directly removes money from existence.

President Ford later renounced this is 1976 and apologized for it, however no court struck it down as unconstitutional.

In an emergency, the president does have the right to quarantine under the [Public Health Service Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Service_Act) , in order to protect the country from a pandemic coming from another country, however it would be a broad usage of that rule to consider every resident from New York or New Jersey as a potential carrier for a foreign pathogen... considering that the virus could come into the US from other international airports. 

He would certainly encounter a legal challenge, namely from anyone who would be leaving NY or NJ and say, already tested negative for the virus.  That person could conceivably be fleeing the pandemic hotspot and it would be malicious to force them to stay there when they may potentially become infected.  

Could the government require that someone leaving the quarantine area test positive for antibodies? Not enough is known about this virus to determine whether a natural immunity after infection is possible, as many other coronaviruses (like the common cold) do not give permanent immunity.  

Also, as others have mentioned, Posse Comitatus Act restricts his ability to use federal troops to enact domestic policy.  So who would enforce such a quarantine with effectivity would be the next question.  

So I would argue that this particular scenario hasn't come up before so he could certainly try, but it would likely be a logistical and legal battle that would outlive the pandemic.

They’re doing an extremely slow build up of social distancing.

There just doesn't seem to be a lot of English level coverage about China; at least not the way where you can easily dozens of articles about President Trump wanting to reopen the economy by Easter.

With that said I will try with what I can. My understanding is it wasn't a shutdown everywhere, but I think many also underestimate the restrictions in other cities outside of Hubei. In major cities like Shanghai, they've used quarantine policies similar to [what they're doing to foreigners](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/travelers-to-china-encounter-changing-coronavirus-quarantine-policies.html); Beijing did [something similar in early Feb](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/coronavirus-latest-updates-hong-kong-pledges-3point2-billion-business-in-china-try-to-return-to-work.html). In talking to my suppliers and colleagues, factories did come online early February around the week of February 10th. The requirement at those factories (unclear if it was a local government requirement or company requirement) was that people had to be in Shanghai for 14 days minimum before being allowed to work. I have seen this with factories in Shenzhen as well where factory visit guidelines (I can't share work information) were also outlined where you need [14 days of being in Shenzhen](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/16/c_138884254.htm) before being let in.

,"Being a native Chinese speaker I was able to glean a bit more from local media, though given the political reality over there it would be hard to provide much support in terms of concrete data, let alone English ones.

,"If you want a straight answer to the titular question about the Main Street Business Lending Program (MSBLB), then it is ""We don't know yet, because the Fed didn't provide details of that particular program yet.""

In the Fed's [latest press release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm) (March 23), it provides details on three newly established facilities -  [Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200323b1.pdf) (PMCCF), [Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200323b2.pdf) (SMCCF), and [Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200323b3.pdf) (TALF). All it says about the MSBLB is the following:

>In addition to the steps above, the Federal Reserve expects to announce  soon the establishment of a Main Street Business Lending Program to  support lending to eligible small-and-medium sized businesses,  complementing efforts by the SBA.

The program details cited in the OP's text (taken from the Reuters news article) concern the three newly created facilities: PMCCF, SMCCF, and TALF.

As it isn't possible to answer to the questions from the OP's text in regards the MSBLB, I will try to answer them in regards the three known programs established by the Fed.

>**I would like a better understanding of the short (1 month), medium (6-12  month), and long term (1 year and beyond) goals and expected impacts.** 

The Fed's goals are rather simple and are dictated by its mandate:

>The Federal Reserve's role is guided by its mandate from Congress to  promote maximum employment and stable prices, along with its  responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. In  support of these goals, the Federal Reserve is using its full range of  authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to  American families and businesses.

The goals of the PMCCF and SMCCF, according to the Fed, are ""to support credit to large employers.""

The goal of the TALF is ""to support the flow of credit to consumers and businesses.""

&#x200B;

>**Has the Fed enacted similar programs in the past?**

Yes, it has. Some examples:

November 2008 [creation of the TALF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20081125a.htm) to ""lend up to  $200 billion on a non-recourse basis to holders of certain AAA-rated ABS  backed by newly and recently originated consumer and small business  loans.""

[Lending to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20090311a1.pdf)

January 2009 Agreement to [guarantee or lend $118b to BoA](https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/bofa092109.pdf) against a pool ""consisting of securities  backed  by  residential  and  commercial real estate loans and corporate debt, and related derivatives.""

&#x200B;

>**If so, what were their short, medium and long term impacts?** 

For example, regarding the impact of TALF 2008, Brian P. Sack (Executive  Vice  President  of  Markets  Group of the FRBNY) [notes](https://www.bis.org/review/r100614d.pdf) among other achievements:

>By  providing  liquidity  and  a  backstop  to  limit  losses  to  investors,  the  TALF  contributed  importantly  to  the  revival  of  securitized  credit  markets.  Secondary  spreads  narrowed  significantly,  and  volatility  moderated.  Moreover,  the  improvements  in  the  secondary  market  helped  re-start  the  new-issue  market.  Issuance  of  non-mortgage asset-backed securities jumped to $35 billion in the first three months of TALF lending  in  2009,  after  having  slowed  to  less  than  $1  billion  per  month  in  late  2008.  During  those initial months that the TALF was in operation, about half of the issuance in the market was  financed  by  the  facility,  with  this  degree  of  support  then  gradually  declining  as  market  function improved. 

One of the conclusions in [*The Federal Reserve’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility*](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/12v18n3/1210ashc.pdf) by Adam Ashcraft, Allan Malz, and Zoltan Pozsar:

>The implementation of TALF for nonmortgage new-issue ABS was associated with a dramatic recovery in secondary-market spreads, outpacing the broad recovery in spreads across credit markets.

I also recommend reading this article by Money and Banking on the extent of how well can monetary policy work on impact from the COVID-19 outbreak:

,"[The Fed is not allowed to lose money.  It has no funding source.  Back in 2013, there was hand wringing over the possibility](https://money.cnn.com/2013/02/22/news/economy/fed-future-losses/index.html).

In addition to student loans, and credit cards, it is also investing in car loans.  All of these products carry huge default risks, and probably what is being bought is loans with no repayment likelihood.

The argument the Fed gave when they announced last week they were going to buy commercial paper, was that doing so would give banks the liquidity to issue more commercial paper.  It is still a bank bailout because Fed buying means necessarily overpaying compared to people afraid of losing money buying. 
 Banks are unlikely to issue new commercial loans to closed businesses, though not all have that status.

As to the listed products,

1. I would not understand how it is possible to buy an open credit card account, and so must presume, they are buying closed accounts with balances outstanding.  Hopefully they are not paying the credit card companies 100% of loan value, but it is still a bailout for them to be paying more than the pennies that the market might pay.  Visa/MC are exceptionally profitable companies.  Amex does ok.  But they might cut credit limits if not for this program.

2. Auto loans I think were part of 2008 bailouts.  The fact that factories are closed right now negates any argument for them needing a bailout to make new car loans.

3. Student loans have the same problem as car loans.  Schools closed.  Not the season for new loans anyway.  Pending legislation includes student loan forgiveness.  This could be a bailout of both banks and schools that must deal with refund requests, or have sales difficulty getting enrollment next year.

The Fed maintained an illusion of credibility in 2008 crisis, by always keeping the possibility of unprinting money by selling the bond portfoliio on its books, and having enough good bonds (Treasuries) to offset crap (mortages + autos).

They are buying an extremely high amount of Treasuries this time around, but balancing would still allow only a small percentage of extreme crap.

2008 QE was an extreme success because, in hindsight, a sure thing investment was to buy treasuries 1 day or 1 hour before the Fed bought them back at a higher price from you.  Treasuries were still sure things, but this was a sure quick (M)buck.  The quick buck opportunities though meant that the Fed did not have to buy as much, if everyone else was buying because they were backstopping it.

There's a lot more risk this time around.  Recoveries are not like the physical certainty of sunrises.  If you argued that we could not afford anything under the great times of the Bernie Campaign, its hard to make the argument that you can afford 10x with half the GDP.",Godspiral,,fnqnp5,flbuu8t

The long and short of it is this:

1) Governments can do whatever it wants with money (**Including printing money**) to achieve prosperity.

2) The only real danger is hyper inflation, as seen in Zimbabwe.

I will only focus on the internal effects because the international effects will be complete bullshit.

Short-term: Businesses will be kept in a zombie state of existence (not making money, but can continue to cover expenses with loans, hopefully until everything is back to normal).

Medium-term: Large 'entities' - not just banks - will abuse the shite out of this policy to generate obscene amounts of profits. We're talking trillions of dollars here. This will push wealth inequality to the absolute limits the system can handle.

Long-term: no one knows - everyone is just hoping we don't hit Zimbabwe levels of inflation.

Edit: Almost forgot - the Fed as NEVER done anything like this. Ever. To be clear I am talking about lending on this scale to main street businesses. And it hasn't gone through yet. But it's looking extremely likely at the moment. I wouldn't be surprised to wake up tomorrow and see it's gone through.",Bldyknuckles,,fnqnp5,flb3v4u
,"According to several sources, including [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/ef3539ec-5f96-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4), the top 5% of US wealth holders pay 60% of tax receipts annually. I think it's well understood that a large portion of the taxable income for these individuals is through capital gains, so we can extend that further to safely assume that a depreciation in equity and bond prices will directly lead to an increased federal deficit. 

If you can accept that, this directly stands against the old adage that the stock market is not the real economy, but only a reflection of it. In fact, the stock market (and to a larger extent, the bond market) *is the US economy*, as sad as that is. 

More anecdotally, you can see this to be the case as unemployment claims rise coincidentally when the stock market tanks and vise versa. I submit that these aren't two separate events occurring that stem from the same macroeconomic environment, but rather there is a cause and effect relationship. If you think about it logically, a business whose stock price tanks is unable to sell corporate bonds at reasonable interest rates to raise cash even though the two are not mechanically linked. 

The Fed knows this, and this is why they run to the rescue every time there is a hiccup in markets even though it's not technically one of their dual mandates to protect stock prices. They cannot hope to save the economy without also (first) saving the stock market. This puts them in an inherently awkward position of looking like they're running to the aid of the 5% while the 95% are suffering orders of magnitude more. I don't say this to defend the Fed because it's a crisis of their own making, but it is the situation nonetheless.

So they've done the helicopter money for corporations in the past after 2008 and people obviously didn't like it. They can't risk doing the same thing again because there would undoubtedly be extreme civil unrest at a second corporate bailout without a simultaneous bailout for individuals who (rightfully) felt like they got the short end of the stick the last time around.

So that's my read on *why* a Main Street bailout is on the table this time around. I don't believe, for a second, that it has anything to do with coronavirus or it's effects.

Anyway, the implied argument from the Fed here is that despite the money printing after the financial crisis, there was no real inflation in the real economy so they can do it again on a wider scale. The problem is that the two types of bailouts are likely to have very different effects, but the Fed either chooses to ignore that fact or they're blissfully unaware (which seems unlikely).

The last bailout *did* lead to inflation--it's just that the inflation was limited to asset prices. See the increase in wealth equality, where the asset owners in the country made out like bandits while we got priced out of equities, real estate, rents, and everything else that is considered an asset. It *did not* lead to inflation in consumer goods, which is what we typically think about when we talk about inflation. The reason is fairly simple, in my opinion. The bailout money went into the pockets of those that were only ever going to use it to buy more assets. JP Morgan and staff weren't waiting for the bailout money so they could go buy a new refrigerator or hire a plumber, so you didn't see inflation there.

What the Fed is attempting to do now, alongside the corporate bailouts, is to inject money directly into the consumer market. This *has the potential* to lead to consumer goods inflation because this money is going to people who *will* use it on a new TV.

However, this isn't just bad news because bread will cost more. *If inflation sets in*, it can unravel the entire US financial system and take pensions and retirement savings with it. This is because in an inflationary environment, bond prices have to drop, particularly longer term bonds. You wouldn't buy a 30 year bond that pays 3% if inflation is projected to be 5% because you're effectively gauranteeing yourself a 2% loss over that time. This is the exact opposite effect of what the Fed is hoping to do, which is to keep rates low (and bond prices high). 

If bond prices drop at the same time as stock prices, pretty much the entire risk parity investment portfolio that is the bedrock of American finance goes into tailspin. Pension commitments won't be sustainable. Retirement accounts will start to lose value on both stocks and bonds without a good alternative right as the largest demographic of people (boomers) hits retirement age. This will increase the burden on social safety net programs at the same time that tax revenues have fallen (which is where I began my comment). So less money in, more money out. This will exacerbate drop in bond prices as market participants become increasingly worried about the US either A) not being able to meet it's commitments to bond holders, or B) trying to print their way out of those commitments. It's a positive feedback loop.

This is all doom and gloom but it has happened to almost every capitalist economy sooner or later, so there's no reason to think the United States is different in that respect. The only question is *when*. What the virus might have done is to speed up that clock by putting stress on the system prematurely. 

The number to watch to figure it what will happen in the medium end long term is inflation. If the Fed is somehow able to do everything they're saying they will do without inflation, it will be the first Central Bank that has it ""all figured out"". If inflation rears its head, the Fed literally has no tools to stop it with the current economic situation.",mdcd4u2c,,fnqnp5,flckln2

The U.S. Government Accountability Office has written a series of reports on U.S. fiscal health, which is increasingly in the toilet anyway before the current stimulus. [Here is a report](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-299sp) from a couple years ago. The major concerns include the idea that more capital flowing to safe government bonds means less capital flowing to innovative enterprise, thus reducing productivity in the long run; and that it reduces the ability of government to spend on other important stuff because it’s spending more on interest. It can also impact the value of the dollar, but someone else with expertise can better discuss that.

Of course, the whole point of a Keynesian stimulus is that in the near term the economy and productivity are ALREADY in the toilet, and government thus steps in to make up for the shortfall. Stimulus is pure benefit now/costs later. We do have a recent experiment to point to: the 2009 Recovery Act, which did seem to achieve the results it was intended to, more or less.

We also need to make supply chains of necessary goods like certain medications and PPE more redundant so they aren't wiped out by a quarantine. Right now with China under quarantine, it means the production of PPE and generic medications has mostly ground to a stop.

The key takeaway is that zoonotic pathogens are basically a byproduct of working with livestock. Viruses mutate from their original animal host to human hosts. The probability of this happening is exceptionally low, but when large groups of people work with animals every single day for years, the probability that it happens at least once becomes high.  

Minimizing the number of people making direct contact with livestock is the obvious move. Wet markets are a particularly strong breeding ground so ending them will help but there are still other places a pathogen might evolve.",IIAOPSW,,flvqw3,fl31fdu
,"At its most basic level we could invest in preventing the next pandemic. What we spend is based on our assessment of risk and mitigation. Currently we're spending a ton to mitigate military risks and very little to mitigate health risks.

But even that isn't the whole story because thats lumping all health spending. It doesn't discuss health spending specific to pandemics etc. [This 2019 document](https://www.phe.gov/about/aspr/Documents/BIB-2019.pdf) has numbers for recent budget requests:

• $1.27 billion for ASPR’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) including:

• $512 million to support the advanced development of  
the highest priority MCMs, which includes $192 million to combat antimicrobial resistant bacteria (CARB), $260 million to support Advanced Research and Development (ARD), and $60 million for BARDA operations;

• $245 million for diagnostic tools, vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and international preparedness for pandemic influenza ( PI ) and emerging infectious diseases, and

• $510 million for Project BioShield (PBS) to support late- stage development and procurement of MCMs for national security threats.

• $575 million for the SNS.

• $254.5 million for the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) to support cooperative agreements with state, local, and territorial health departments to improve healthcare delivery surge capacity and enhance regional emergency preparedness and response coordination through healthcare coalitions.

• $80.3 million for federal Preparedness and Emergency Operations, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), and the Civilian Volunteer Medical Reserve Corps (MRC).

• $46 million for health security policy, strategic planning, and ASPR operations.

A country which has gone through MERS a few years ago and SARS before that. Not only do the healthcare workers have experience, their leaders have the same experience.

What they have that no one else has: quick and decisive actions. they didn't need to quarantine as much as us, as they detected the pandemic quick enough to start mass production of everything needed. Mobilization of health care workers and explaining the situation to the public early on, for them to get prepared without panicking. Making the public follow orders, as there are orders. Unlike most other governments, which don't share this experience and hesitated to take full power of their citizens lives and actually calling it an emergency. Spreading the curve so that the initial cases don't overwhelm the healthcare system and supplies.

Spreading of the curve. Just like most other nations are attempting.

What the rest of the world needs to do, is to look at SK for inspiration. having only 102 deaths with 2600 recoveries. In comparison, Italy which was hit a few days after SK, has 4000 deaths and 5200 recoveries.

> 
> 1. **Be First**: Crises are time-sensitive. Communicating information quickly is almost always important. For members of the public, the first source of information often becomes the preferred source.
> 2. **Be Right**: Accuracy establishes credibility. Information can include what is known, what is not known, and what is being done to fill in the gaps.
> 3. **Be Credible**: Honesty and truthfulness should not be compromised during crises.
> 4. **Express Empathy**: Crises create harm, and the suffering should be acknowledged in words. Addressing what people are feeling, and the challenges they face, builds trust and rapport.
> 5. **Promote Action**: Giving people meaningful things to do calms anxiety, helps restore order, and promotes a restored sense of control.
> 6. **Show Respect**: Respectful communication is particularly important when people feel vulnerable. Respectful communication promotes cooperation and rapport.

,"There’s been a lot of confusion over this move because it is described as a ‘loan’, but that’s not entirely accurate. It is actually a [repurchase agreement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repurchaseagreement.asp) or ‘repo’.

What the Fed has done here is gone to banks and said “I will buy $500 billion in government bonds if you agree to buy them back in X days for $500.0001 billion dollars”. The banks agree to this in order to ensure they have enough cash on hand to loan to other banks and businesses. This is kind of a loan in the sense that the Fed is temporarily giving banks money to be repaid for a profit, but the key difference is that the Fed holds the bonds as collateral in the meantime. This means there is little to no risk of default on these loans since the Fed can turn around and sell the bonds to recoup any losses. The key point here is that this means this isn’t really a stack of cash sitting around that could be redirected. The fundamental mechanism here is a temporary injection of liquid cash in exchange for safe collateral. That isn’t the case with other suggestions floated around like using this money for a temporary UBI, or canceling student loan debt. 

It may be surprising to know that these types of repurchase agreements happen every day as a normal mechanism to keep the economy moving and regulated. Usually, they are for smaller amounts (I think around $100 billion each day). What the Fed has done here is increased that amount to $500 billion over three days, which is why you alternatively see headlines saying they are injecting $500 billion or $1.5 trillion into the economy. The reason this can happen without much debate is that it is to a large part ‘baked in’ to normal operation - the only thing that has changed is the daily amount, and even then temporarily.

The Fed can, in fact, pull money out of thin air.

The Fed is the entity entrusted with the power to create and destroy US dollars.  In order to do this with some amount of fairness, the way they work is that they will [print a bunch of money,](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html)^1 and then use that money to buy things.  Normally, the things they buy are Treasury bonds, i.e. US Government debt.

Once I've sold that to the Fed, I now have $9,900 in cash that I need to invest somewhere else in the economy.  

To reduce the money supply, the Fed does the opposite.  They go out and sell bonds, meaning people have less cash in hand, and more promises of money in the future.  The Fed then takes the cash they got from those sales and burns it.^2

,"Excuse the super long post, I'll answer your questions be answering three different ones: 

1. What are banks and money to begin with?
2. What's up with our current banking system?
3. Why are markets so crazy that the Fed would need to intervene? 

**1. What are banks and money to begin with?**

People casually think about deposits and cash (as in, dollar bills) as the same.  And while for practical purposes for the every day person, they are the same, there are some meaningful differences.  Cash is ""government money"", as the government is promising you the value of that money (in the past, cash was a promise to convert to gold, now its just a promise!).  While deposits are actually ""bank money"", because the bank promises you that the deposit has the same value as cash and it will give you cash anytime you want to redeem your deposits (or use an ATM!).  

The government controls total supply of cash, while banks (mostly) are the ones to control deposits.  The ""mostly"" comes in because these different types are tightly connected, because there's a [hierarchy to money](https://ieor.columbia.edu/files/seasdepts/industrial-engineering-operations-research/pdf-files/Mehrling_P_FESeminar_Sp12-02.pdf), based on this series of promises.  The US banking system is called ""fractional reserve system"" because banks don't need to hold $1 bill for every $1 in a deposit account.  It just needs to hold some fraction (the minimum amount is called its ""reserves""), and then it can create a deposit when it creates a loan.  

Maybe this is really basic, but in case its helpful to someone:  thinking in terms of balance sheets comes in handy to see the magic of money creation.  If the bank receives $10 cash from you, it will have $10 cash on the asset side of its balance sheet and a $10 deposit on the liability side (because its a promise to pay you).  Now if the bank then wants to make a $8 loan to person B, it has two options:  

* It can give person B the cash.  Then, the bank has on its asset-side the $2 cash ($10 from you minus what it gave person B) and a $8 loan (because person B promises to repay that money).  Then on the liability-side, it still just owes you your $10 deposit.  
* Now, much more interesting:  instead of giving person B cash, the bank may just create a deposit for person B.  After all, deposits are typically just as accepted as cash (and way more convenient!). So the bank's balance sheet then becomes on the asset side: $10 cash (as no cash transactions were needed) and $8 loan.  On the liability side:  $10 deposit for you + $8 deposit for person B.  And the cash will go to either you or person B, whoever demands it first.  Now, person B wanted a loan, so the bank is likely to expect to use some of its cash to ""cash out"" person B's deposit (after all, person B likely asked for the loan to use that money in some way).  But notice how the bank balance sheet went from $10 in assets (and deposits) to $18 in assets (and deposits), just by the magic.  In a world with $10 cash, banking can expand it to $18 deposits.

Why would it be useful to do this sort of alchemy?  If its just about the convenience of using deposits (which are electronic) vs. cash (which is a physical good you need to carry and gets quite heavy if you're carrying tons of gold across the world)?

In a world with just $10 cash, that's also the upper limit of all economic activity.  In a world where you can multiply the money, you're also now creating the scenario where you're able to loan to person B and maybe person B then brings something new and magical and productive into the world.  As other posts have mentioned, the central bank then influences this expansion/contraction by managing reserves.  That's a bit of the intuition for why it could be desirable to allow banks to expand their balance sheets (btw, I would also recommend this [NY Fed's blog](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/07/how-the-fed-changes-the-size-of-its-balance-sheet.html) which has an excellent post on expanding/contracting balance sheet)

**2. What's up with our current banking system?**

While my toy example above was about balance sheet expansion applied to loans, a lot of bank balance sheet expansion today goes to financing trading and financial activity (e.g., helping hedge funds/investors place bets in the market).  For example, check out slide 16 of [JP Morgan's Investor Day Firm Overview Presentation](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/investor-relations/document/2020_firm_overview_ba56d0e8.pdf).  Less than half of its interest-earning assets are actual loans.  The other stuff are:  investment securities (stock/bonds that JPMC purchases as part of its own investment portfolio to hold and use the cash flow to help manage its business), trading assets (stock/bonds purchased to make bets on the market), and then the remainder, the nearly 20%, is the stuff that provides the lifeline for financial markets.

(Now I'm going to slightly plagiarize myself from another post)  Let's say you're a hedge fund making a bet that Apple stock will increase over time (""go long on Apple""). If the stock costs $100 and you had $100 cash, and it went to $102, you would make 2% which is great, but not as great if you could use just $10 cash and borrow the $90, because in that case, you would make $2 using up only $10, so it would be a 20% return (minus the cost of borrowing $90)

This is how hedge funds make a ton more money, by “leveraging up” and borrowing money from banks to place their bets. Why would the bank lend that much? Does it even make sense? The bank in that transaction above is just making some fraction of the $90 it lends (that is, whatever the hedge fun pays in lending cost). To make this a safer bet for the bank, the bank asks the $100 Apple stock as “collateral”. So if the hedge fund goes cabum, the bank can then sell off the Apple stock and be made whole in its investment.

What’s the rate that the bank lends the money? And how does the bank itself come up with the $90 to offer the hedge fund? So the bank can borrow money from the Fed at Fed Funds rate (FF) (it may choose to get that $90 from another source, but for sake of this example, just imagine that it COULD if it wanted to borrow at the FF rate). So the bank wants to make some money from lending to the hedge fund, so that’s why it charges some amount X above the FF rate.

This is the part that gets crazy and a bit house of cards. Ok, let’s go back to how the bank gets the $90. So if it lends it out, it’s going to get stock as collateral. What the bank can then do, is use that Apple stock as collateral itself, to generate cash to give to the hedge fund. YES. It is this crazy. This is what’s meant by ""doing a repo"". A bank may also call this “monetizing” the Apple stock, because it’s creating money from this stock.

Now, who lends the cash to the bank? Typically players like money market funds (the normal person places their cash in a FDIC-insured bank but if you’re rich, you place your cash with other types of institutions, so there are several players that are “cash rich”). The money market fund will lend to the bank at some cost, which it may also decide to price relative to FF.

When you lend to a bank, you expect that to be somewhat safer then lending to a hedge fund. So while the hedge fund has to pay FF+X to borrow cash, the bank pays some smaller amount FF+Y, where Y is smaller than X. So the bank will receive FF+X then pay FF+Y.

So that’s why the bank does repo. It’s basically providing a pass-through between the money market fund and the hedge fund. And you can think of this as money circulating in the system.",speculys,,fhovv8,fkd4pf0

,"The short story is that it just marks up a few bank accounts on the computer.

The longer story is that The Fed runs a deficit i.e., it accrues national debt. But it’s a different kind of debt than you and I are used to.

The Fed can keep accruing debt as long as it wants to without ever going bankrupt. Unlike us, it is literally *impossible* for the United States to ever run out of money and become insolvent. No matter how much debt spending it accumulates, a few facts always ring true:

* The US debt is in US dollars
* The US is the sole producer of US dollars

The Fed can always just print more money to pay back it’s debt when it needs to.

The question we should be asking is this:

>**Is there enough stuff being produced such that if I put a trillion dollars into the economy, there will eventually be an extra trillion dollars worth of stuff that people can buy with that money?**

Inflation only hits when there is an increase in the money supply and a decrease in stuff to buy. Having less stuff and more money is what causes it.

As long as there is enough production and *stuff*, we can print all the money we want and inflation will not occur.

The fed injecting trillions of dollars is the government making a bet that there will be trillion dollars of economic value created from it’s bet eventually.

Unlike other countries, this bet by the US doesn’t need to be super precise or accurate. The US dollar will *always* maintain a certain amount of it’s value due to the idea of the “PetroDollar”.

The PetroDollar is a system the US has created for itself (using it’s military) to force oil to be traded in US dollars.

The result of this system is that if a country wants energy, they need to sell stuff to the US to acquire US dollars before they can purchase oil.

Because everybody needs energy to function, this creates a guaranteed level of demand on the US dollar that will always support it’s strength no matter what.

Basically, the USA has rigged the system where it’s in a position to inject trillions more into it’s own economy on top of what was already injected, without significant effects on inflation.

Getting past this question of “How can we afford it?” gets us thinking about other questions like:

* Can we also use it to reduce student loans?
* Can we use it to eliminate poverty?
* Who is this money benefitting the most the way it’s currently being injected? Would it be benefitting more people if it was injected somewhere else?

,"In the 1930’s a bunch of powerful bankers got together and form a very cohesive political entity which pressured the government to create the Federal reserve bank (the fed). Sloppily referencing Keynes they made appeals that a centralized political authority needed the ability to print and destroy money on a whim, so that suave politicians could guide the rest of us naive followers indirectly via controlling the interest rates and supply of money. We are just living in the aftermath of the creation of these institutions. It is entirely unconstitutional, but who cares. No one seems to mind that 10 economists get to destroy the dollar and create massive inflation just so politicians can brag about having low unemployment. The money quite literally does come out of thin air, as most “money” is never printed but is merely digits added to a computer spreadsheet. Modern Monetary Theory (MMM) holds a tight grip on the minds of many contemporary policy makers, and the implications of its theories are that the gov is not a firm or household, and since it has a monopoly on the supply of money (counterfeiters will be prosecuted with the swiftness), there is no good reason not to just create as much as is needed in any given catastrophe. Of course they miss the mark on inflation and tend to completely discount it as a non-issue, so to their models there is no downside to simply creating new fiduciary media on a whim.

There is no Federally-required process to follow if a candidate who is projected to receive electoral votes dies or becomes incapacitated between the general election and the meeting of electors. However,  individual States may have their own requirements that govern how electors must vote at the meeting of the electors. In 1872, when Horace Greeley passed away between Election Day and the meeting of electors, the electors who were slated to vote for Greeley voted for various candidates, including Greeley. The votes cast for Greeley were not counted due to a House resolution passed regarding the matter. See the full Electoral College vote counts for President and Vice President in the 1872 election.

>**We don’t know what would happen if a candidate who, after dies or becomes incapacitated between the meeting of electors and the counting of electoral votes in Congress.** 

>The Constitution is silent on whether this candidate meets the definition of “President elect” or “Vice President elect.” If the candidate with a majority of the electoral votes is considered “President elect,” even before the counting of electoral votes in Congress, Section 3 of the 20th Amendment applies. Section 3 of the 20th Amendment states that the Vice President elect will become President if the President elect dies or becomes incapacitated.

The most complicated and possibly contentious scenarios are if the candidate dies after the general election but before the electoral college vote, if the candidate dies before the general election but after the primaries are finished, and if a candidate with a winning number of delegates passes away before a convention. In the former case it'll probably come down to litigation over how electors are supposed to vote in the event that the person they pledged to vote for is dead. It could simply fall to the vice presidential candidate. In the latter cases it's mostly up to the DNC/RNC, but some state laws about who is allowed on the ballot may become stumbling blocks.

The Democratic version emphasizes consultation with other bodies before the DNC picks the new candidate; the Republican version authorizes the RNC to reconvene the national convention for the purposes of selecting a new candidate -- although, given the logistical impossibility of doing that, it's extremely unlikely that clause will ever be used.

*After election day but before the electoral college votes*:

The electors are, legally speaking, free agents. Even if the presidential candidate is alive, electors can't constitutionally be forced to vote for him or her (despite many many state laws that imagine otherwise); the ongoing case [*Baca v. Colorado*](https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/18/18-1173.pdf) seems likely to settle that question once and for all.

In any event, if the candidate is *dead*, there is no question of binding electors. Electors would vote for whomever they thought best. If a single candidate got 270 electoral votes, that candidate would be elected president. If *no* candidate won a majority in the electoral college (which seems likely once the pledged electors are unmoored from their unity candidate), then the election would be thrown to the House.

*After the electoral college votes:*

As a practical matter, this would be settled by majority votes in both houses of Congress. 

There would be a series of procedural votes during the certification process, which are *rigidly* limited by the provisions of [3 USC 15-18](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/chapter-1). Congress would have to decide (1) whether to accept the electoral votes for the dead guy, (2) what to do with those votes if they are not accepted (are they still counted as part of the requirement for majority, or treated like abstentions?), and (3) who should be considered the top vote-getters if the election is thrown to the House.

It seems likely to me that they would just accept the votes for the dead guy, then declare the office vacant, and the Vice President would get the job under the Constitution's succession procedures. It would certainly be simplest, and also seems to me like probably the best reading of the Constitution. But we won't know until it happens.",BCSWowbagger2,,ffxkw8,fkbtbpw

,"The [Libertarian Party Bylaws in effect in 2016](https://www.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Libertarian-Party-Bylaws-and-Convention-Rules-0508-rev.pdf) say that:

> In the event of the death, resignation, disqualification or suspension of the nomination of the Party's nominee for President, the Vice-Presidential nominee shall become the Presidential nominee. Two-thirds of the entire membership of the National Committee may, at a meeting, fill a Vice-Presidential vacancy, and, if necessary, a simultaneous Presidential vacancy.

It has a line of succession from VP to President then allows the national committee to act as it sees fit to fill the VP vacancy. 

I am curious how the state laws might work with or against the party decisions. I can see hypothetical scenarios where candidates from any party are blocked by unfriendly secretaries of state because of nonsense around filing deadlines, laws of state succession of candidates, or ballot printing issues. Such moves would be political hardball and likely get the courts involved.",RotaryJihad,,ffxkw8,fk172oh
,"> the law is clear. The 20th Amendment states without much room for  ambiguity: “\[t\]he terms of the President and Vice President shall end at  noon on the 20th day of January . . . and the terms of their successors  shall then begin.” But, it goes on to contemplate that something might  go wrong in the process of selecting who will hold office on that date:  
>  
>If a President shall not have been chosen before the time  fixed for the beginning of his term, or *if the President elect shall  have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as  President until a President shall have qualified; and the Congress may  by law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice  President elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as  President*. \[emphasis added\]

Another 4.4 million Obama voters did not vote in 2016, and an additional 2.3 million (who were more likely younger) supported third-party candidates, amounting to 6.7 million—more than the number of Obama-to-Trump voters, who received the bulk of the post-election attention.""

Much of the difference came from Milwaukee, which had the lowest voting rate in 16 years.

,">what avenues, going forward, does Congress have to obtain pertinent information from the Executive branch, either during the inquiry or trial phase of an impeachment?

[This piece by Prof. Josh Chafetz](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/02/congress-cant-rely-courts-enforce-its-subpoenas-dont-panic/) gives a good summary of other tools Congress has in its toolbox.  There are three big tools I see:

1.  Reaching below senior officials into the civil/military service to elicit testimony.  This was the key strategy Democrats used in the Trump impeachment proceedings in the House.  When senior officials like the [Secretary of Defense](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/giuliani-says-he-wont-comply-with-congressional-subpoena) rebuffed subpoenas, the House investigators sought and obtained testimony from lower ranking officials serving under their authority such as [LTC Vindman.](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/08/777514772/read-testimony-of-alexander-vindman-the-white-houses-ukraine-specialist)  In this case, a presidential blockade of information would need to rely on there being no relevant witnesses willing to talk even under threat of a subpoena.

2.  Using appropriations power to demand testimony or documents.  In the Post piece I linked, Chafetz suggests that:

 >[Congress] can use its power of the purse and prohibit the expenditure of funds on, say, the White House Counsel’s Office, until McGahn comes around. Of course, the Senate might refuse to go along with such an appropriations rider, or the president might threaten to veto the appropriations bill containing it. But if the House held firm, then the choice faced by the Senate and president would be to accept the rider or to fail to pass the entire appropriations bill, thereby shutting down a significant portion of the government.

3.  Congress can use its inherent contempt powers to send out the Sgt. at Arms and a posse of Capitol Police officers to arrest recalcitrant witnesses and forcibly bring them before the Congress.  The dissent in the _McGahn_ opinion discusses this a bit:  

 >[D]etaining McGahn pursuant to the
House’s inherent contempt authority, is similarly
impracticable. Understandably desiring not to risk physical
combat with the Executive Branch... the House has declined to use that authority to detain an
Executive official for nearly 100 years. 

 Ironically, if the House were to use inherent contempt authority, the courts would almost certainly be forced to rule on it in the context of a [habeas corpus petition, as they have in the past.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34097.pdf)",huadpe,,fcejam,fjdctse
,"> Does the Federal government have the authority to impose quarantine requirements on individuals within the US absent special circumstances like interstate or international travel?

[Yes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/264), but under (d)(1) only if a person is ""reasonably believed"" to be infected and about to engage in interstate or international travel *or* a ""probable source"" of infection to those who are. Someone living in near-total isolation may be exempt from quarantine but it seems to me that ordinary interactions would place virtually anyone under that blanket.

> What are the circumstances and procedures under which any quarantine or isolation orders could be subject to legal challenge?

You should consider reading [your own source](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/pdf/Public-Health-Order_Generic_FINAL_02-13-2020-p.pdf). Two routes: The CDC offers an administrative process to demand a medical review and evaluation, or you can file a [habeas corpus](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus) petition, which is a general way to challenge any form of detention as unlawful.

> If there is a conflict between federal and state officials related to a quarantine question, how does that get resolved?

Again, your own source addresses this question (federal regulations supersede in a conflict). If we turn again to the [authorizing statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/264) we see that (e) allows states and localities to enforce their own laws and regulations except in a conflict, in which case federal regulations win.

> Can federal officials commandeer state-owned or privately-owned resources (such as hospital facilities, medicine stocks, etc) to effectuate quarantine or other public health measures?

State property: Unsettled AFAIK but doubtful due to the [anti-commandeering doctrine](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2018/05/23/anti-commandeering-an-overview-of-five-major-supreme-court-cases/), which is based on the Tenth Amendment. It may be that courts would find the compelling interest of the government overcomes the states' rights, which is typically determined under [strict scrutiny](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny) analysis. 

Personal property: Well, they can't *commandeer* per se, because of the [Takings Clause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/takings), which prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation, while commandeering generally means no compensation is offered. Generally, a taking need be authorized by law or regulation, and I'm not aware of either giving the CDC that power. Certainly Congress could authorize such a thing.

>It is evident from these considerations, that the plurality of the Executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power, first, the restraints of public opinion, which lose their efficacy, as well on account of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among a number, as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall; and, secondly, the opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the misconduct of the persons they trust, in order either to their removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which admit of it.",,,f8wii1,fiqavsi
,"You are correct about the various benefits that certain immigrants (or nonimmigrants) will be excepted from the rule or may have already been ineligible for the benefit. The biggest change to the Public Charge rule comes in the additional discretion that government officers are allowed in making that determination.

The rules create “heavily weighted” factors, both negative and positive. It is a heavily weighted negative factor to receive more than 12 months of public benefits in the aggregate over the 36-month period of time before submitting the application for adjustment or admission. Heavily weighted positive factors include having a household income of at least 250% of the federal poverty level. It is not clear how an immigration officer should decide a case that has a heavily weighted factor or, for instance, has both heavily weighted negative and positive factors, as no one factor should be dispositive.  [https://www.ilrc.org/public-charge](https://www.ilrc.org/public-charge). This lack of clarity makes it more difficult for lawyers to tell clients whether or not their application will be approved, and I suspect it will make adjudications take longer.

Overall, it is not the most significant change that the Trump Administration has made to immigration law. In fact, the public charge concept became part of the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1952. In 1996, the concept was developed further by the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Welfare Reform Law. Up until the Trump administration intervened, the officers at USCIS and the State Department used guidance from 1999 to make determinations. The proposed rule that initiated this process provides a good history of the public charge rule.   [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/10/10/2018-21106/inadmissibility-on-public-charge-grounds](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/10/10/2018-21106/inadmissibility-on-public-charge-grounds).

One important impact that I have seen in my experiences as a law student is the deterrent effect the policy has had on people who remain eligible for the benefits (certain visas for victims of crime, refugees, and more) , but are unaware of the exception. I would assume that affected populations may also be unaware of the exceptions related to natural disasters etc. that you mentioned above.

,"The rule expands the circumstances under which individuals can be denied admission and green cards based on a finding that they are *likely at any time* to become a public charge. Under the new standard, immigration officials will look at factors including the person’s age, health, family status, education, skills, assets, resources, role as a caregiver, and whether the person is using or has used in the past three years one or more of a set of public benefits. The [Migration Policy Institute](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/chilling-effects-us-public-charge-rule-commentary) found that 69 percent of green card recipients had at least one of these negative factors, 43 percent had at least two, and 17 percent had at least three.

More than that, although few people directly affected by the rule are enrolled in public benefit programs (as you noted), research suggests that the rule will have chilling effects that will lead immigrant families to forgo enrollment in or disenroll themselves and their children from programs they're legally entitled to due to confusion and fear that they will face immigration consequences. A recent [Urban Institute report](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/100270/one_in_seven_adults_in_immigrant_families_reported_avoiding_publi_7.pdf) found that 20 percent of adults in low-income families with one or more noncitizen members without a green card either did not apply for, or withdrew from participation in, a noncash government benefit program in 2018 for fear of risking future green card status. A [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/report-section/estimated-impacts-of-final-public-charge-inadmissibility-rule-on-immigrants-and-medicaid-coverage-key-findings/) report estimates the rule could lead up to 4.7 million people to withdraw from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) alone. This will have an adverse impact not on just on potential eligible recipients, but also on public health and general welfare of the U.S.

edit2: it's important to note that after such unintended consequences of welfare reform on public health and general welfare became known, [policy was clarified in 1999](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_charge_rule#1999_Guidance) in which the the federal government specified that it would not consider use of Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or other non-cash programs in public charge determinations to simplify determinations and prevent deterring eligible aliens and their families, including U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits that they are legally entitled to receive. This updated rule undoes that.

Interestingly, I did some digging through the [initial rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/10/10/2018-21106/inadmissibility-on-public-charge-grounds) and found this [tidbit](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2018-21106/p-258).

>Research shows that when eligibility rules change for public benefits programs there is evidence of a “chilling effect” that discourages immigrants from using public benefits programs for which they are still eligible. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a study shortly after the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 (PRWORA) took effect and found that the number of people receiving food stamps fell by over 5.9 million between summer 1994 and summer 1997.[848] The study notes that enrollment in the food stamps program was falling during this period, possibly due to strong economic growth, but the decline in enrollment was steepest among legal immigrants. Under PRWORA, legal immigrants were facing significantly stronger restrictions through which most would become ineligible to receive food stamps. The study also found that enrollment of legal immigrants in the food stamps program fell by 54 percent. Moreover, another study found evidence of a “chilling effect” due to enactment of PRWORA where non-citizen enrollment in public benefits programs declined more steeply than U.S. citizen enrollment over the period 1994 to 1997.[849] Overall, the study found that welfare enrollment in households headed by foreign-born individuals fell by about 21 percent.",RTRSPRFTR,,f8u9cp,fio0uoh

,"Logically, this would encourage cream skimming for insurance companies. 

Here's the thing - the people that would enrol into the public option for ""Medicare for all who want it"" are generally going to be the people who require care and cannot access it otherwise (can't afford regular private insurance.) This is an assumption, because we don't 100% know how it's going to play out, but the likely scenario is that private insurance will still have the rich and the young - the rich because they can afford it, and the healthy young because they'll probably get a better private rate since they require relatively little care. 

You'll have a public system that is bought into by the poor and those who need care for chronic conditions, and they will require more from the system than what they pay into it. You need the rich/healthy/young to buy into it because that's what offsets the costs of those who require a lot of care. With this, private insurance will make a killing with the rich who pay a lot of insurance and will maybe require a lot of care (but also maybe they don't) and the young who will pay into it and probably won't need a ton of care. 

There are some academic articles on cream skimming in other insurance fields, but not a lot on healthcare. Every insurance field cream skims, and there's some evidence that hospitals do too. You can even see it in doctor's choices in accepting rostered family care patients - they are much more likely to accept those without chronic conditions because it's much more work for same pay for chronic patients.

The upsides of a ""Medicare for All Who Want it"", which is basically a public option, is that it would offer an affordable to the millions of Americans who don't have insurance and could compete with private insurance companies to drive costs.

The downsides are that a public option would not reduce costs enough since private insurance would continue to keep administrative costs up. Private insurance companies would also be able to overburden the public option with sick people while taking all the healthy ones, maximizing their own profits.

,"**Pros:** The up-side to MFA who want it is that this plan won't alienate the huge voting block this is people who receive and are happy with the healthcare they receive through their jobs. Powerful Unions which are essential to the Democratic vote are especially interested in this subject.

Another consideration is that this will not immediately throw the private insurance industry into a tailspin. If MFA were passed, there would be millions of displaced workers throughout all sectors of our economy, especially the healthcare and insurance industries.

Also, MFA who want it will be much easier to pass into law than MFA. Even if the Democrats controlled both houses of congress and the Presidency, [MFA will never pass](https://slate.com/business/2019/11/medicare-for-all-warren-bernie-democrats.html) with the needed majority at this time.

**Cons:** The problem with MFA who want it is that it does nothing to tackle some of the key issues that drive up the cost of healthcare in America. Yes, the price of healthcare services in America is a giant problem. So are the [price of lifesaving drugs](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/no-end-sight-rising-drug-prices-study-finds-n1012181), [cost of new curative treatments](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/drug-prices-high-cost-research-and-development/585253/), [PBMs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/physiciansfoundation/2019/08/22/pbms-driving-up-costs-and-lowering-quality-care-in-america/), [cost of hospital care](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/reports/2019/06/26/471464/high-price-hospital-care/), [salaries of doctors](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/25/doctors-salaries-pay-disparities-000557), etc, etc.

Also, this is a relatively status-quo plan and, since it starts rather conservatively, we can expect that key parts of the bill will be eroded in the legislative process. So, by the time it reaches the President's desk, it may look very similar to what we already have.

Edit: Another pro to MFA who want it is that a MFA plan could actually alienate the poor (including the very poor, some working poor, and college students) if it was ever passed. Currently, Medicaid is both cheaper and more comprehensive than Medicare plans.

,"I don't feel I'm particularly knowledgable enough to answer your question, but I think a really great resource if you would like more information on the topic is the book ""The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care"" by T.R. Reid. The book compares and contrasts the healthcare systems in a number of different countries, including the US, with the backdrop of T.R. Reid exploring treatment options for a bad shoulder in each of the countries. He does a really great job detailing the pros and cons, similarities and differences, of the different healthcare systems. ([Edit: Here is a link to a PBS frontline episode about the book with lots of info if you don't have the time to read the book](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/sickaroundtheworld/))

I think a really important take away for me with the book is that many of the countries frequently cited as having universal healthcare do not have medicare-for-all or single payer systems (for example, germany, france, switzerland, and others have multi-payer but universal healthcare systems). It's something I wish was discussed more.

Right now, I think both democrats and republicans have painted a wrong picture that universal healthcare = single-payer = socialized medicine...but the reality is you can have multi-payer universal healthcare, and single payer doesn't always mean socialized medicine either (Canada has single-payer healthcare but is not socialized medicine, the government is the payer but doctors are not necessarily government employees and hospitals may or may not be government run). Even if you are socialist or other similar political ideologies, I think we can all agree that misinformation doesn't help anyone and many people are unfortunately totally turned off by the idea of universal healthcare because of a misattribution to socialism.

I would love if this conversation (in this thread but most importantly in general) could be expanded to discuss the universal healthcare systems in other countries, particularly the multi-payer models because I think both democrats and republicans would be receptive of them. And I think we will get a better healthcare system in the US if we consider ALL of the options.",meowgrrr,,f8dzvj,filjl5z
,"Yeah sources on this issue are hard to come by.  Best parallel we have is the Obamacare marketplace. The issue was that the people who didn't need it, didn't buy in.   So we end up with a market where doctors can choose to only accept private health insurance if it pays out better.

,"One upside is that a public option is totally consistent with US-style ""capitalism"", and so doesn't require anyone to rethink their ideology. Private insurance companies will still be massively profitable as they find ways to continue skimming the most profitable individuals, and pushing those in most need onto the public option (currently, they are pushed to the fake ""high deductible"" plans). 

Obviously it will be better, at least in the short term, to have more people covered by real insurance plans rather than the scam ""high deductible"" plans. Because the ""public option"" is designed to maintain private profit-taking from healthcare, it's almost certain to be massively more expensive to the public purse than a system not designed to maximize private profit-taking. In that sense, it's more of a poison pill than a solution.

This older article from the Nation provides an analysis of the different flavours of public option: [https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/insurance-health-care-medicare/](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/insurance-health-care-medicare/)

On a political note, the rest of the world continues to shake our collective heads at the complete lack of sense in the current debate around healthcare in the US. There are many different well-tested models to choose from (Germany's managed-market, Canada's single-payer, etc.) that, while obviously not perfect, are clearly superior to the massively inefficient and underperformant US model.

The amount of leverage they have is completely wiped out by that, and if you've ever had to negotiate a contract you would understand how stupid that clause is.

,"The difference is that Medicare for All will introduce single-payer
health care free at the point of service. Medicare for All Who Wants
It, which is a rebranding of the Public Option, will preserve the
private health insurance industry.

The point of health insurance is that the healthy pays for the
sick. I'm young and healthy so I will pay more into the insurance pool
than what I get out of it. Someone who is old or disabled will get
more back than what they pay into it.

With the public option, private insurers would push unhealthy
individuals away and only keep the healthy profitable ones. The public
health insurance wouldn't be allowed to deny anyone coverage and would
be stuck with all the unhealthy and expensive people. Eventually
either taxes would have to be raised to fund the public insurance pool
or it would go bankrupt.

,"Upsides;

When Vermont looked into a strong public option they found it would reduce overall medical spending by 16% over a decade.

It would be less jarring for people who like their health insurance.

Cons;

Medicare for all would save 25% on medical spending vs only 16% in a public option.

It would still leave many people uninsured compared to single payer.

> In comparison with option 1 and 3, Option 2 would still leave approximately 30,000 Vermonters uninsured.

> In analyzing the three options, we determined that all will yield significant savings. However, our research and analysis indicate that the single-payer options will have a more dramatic impact on reducing cost than the public option because they incorporate a uniform benefits package and reduce much of the administrative structure needed to compensate multiple payers. Therefore, we estimate that Option 1 will produce savings of 24.3% of total health expenditure between 2015 and 2024. Option 2 [a public option] will produce savings of 16.1% of total health expenditure between 2015 and 2024. Finally, Option 3 will produce savings of 25.3% of total health expenditure between 2015 and 2024.

I think Minneapolis' method for hand counting would work in your situation since your still using a ranked choice voting method. You just need to count how many ballots for each unique combination there are. This can be simplified by limiting the number of rankings that a person can give. I don't know that you're going to be able to have correct preliminary results on election night. Unless all voting is done in one precinct, you won't be able to definitively say what votes will be transferred until all votes have been counted. IRV methods are not [precinct-summable](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Summability_criterion) and therefor predictions can't be made without all of the necessary information.",Jman9420,,f7japz,fic7cfc

Sorry for not answering your posted question.",applemonkeyman,,f7japz,fibw9db
,"> How can we quickly, efficiently, and reliably hand-count Woodall's method?

If you have a reasonable number of candidates you can turn the ranked preference list into a single integer which you then simply sort by that integer:  For example lets say you have 3 choices.   Then you only have 3 factorial=6 possible ballots:    ABC,ACB,CAB,CBA,BAC,BCA.    So then each precinct labels each of those cases as ""case 1-6"" then counts the total number of each case in each precinct.         I'd even do it personally using peg boards with punch card scantrons so the scantrons that don't have the same ballot ordering literally don't fit in the same box.

Then, you can very easily hand count the numbers of each case, then sum up the results in each ""case"" for each precinct.     

Using the raw numbers for each case it's trivial to simulate whatever method you want on the final outcome.

For 4 people its 24 cases which sounds like a lot but is still reasonable imho.  for 5 people it's 96 cases which, imho, would be unreasonable.

Example:   We do an election with 3 choices and we get the following total votes:

    All the precincts come in and give the following counts for all 6 ""cases""

	ABC	595
	ACB 266
	BAC 2910
	BCA 2103
	CAB 1624
	CBA 2500

Next we remove A (the one with the least votes) 

	BC 595
	CB 266
	BC 2910
	BC 2103
	CB 1624
	CB 2500

and merge

	BC 5608
	CB 4390

B wins.


With 4 choices the process remains the same but with an extra round of merging and with 24 ""cases"" from each precinct instead of 6",Steve132,,f7japz,fidzshm
,"While this isn't a direct answer to the question of how to hand count that method I would encourage you to consider range voting (rangevoting.org).  It is more simple than IRV and doesn't have as many weird issues. Such as eventually leading to a 2 party system, being able to reverse all the ballots and have the same candidate win, it can allow kingmakers and can act strangely when people strategically vote (as people end up trying to do in IRV as shown in places that use it). Here is a comparison if you're interested: https://rangevoting.org/rangeVirv.html. It can be used on current voting machines if this is applicable or counted by hand (https://rangevoting.org/cgi-bin/VoteCostOlson.pl?hcmin=7&hcmax=10&htmin=30&htmax=120&mmin=500&mmax=4000&mvmin=100&mvmax=200)

,"**TL;DR To fix internal Demographic Decline, massively subsidize moms (like the French, but EVEN MORE), or (if you're into being draconian) force them back out of the work force. Otherwise, immigration and its political problems. Someone else please do Economic Break Down.**

Known impacts.... I'll leave that to someone else as that is a long long essay. TL;DR is massively increased per capita healthcare spending due to older people needing more healthcare, massively increased per capita demand on retirement services (depending on country), and a lot of knock on effects. Can someone please crunch the innovativeness loss and increase in conservatism?

Before we get into policy, lets look at underlying issues. Why is the population shrinking in these countries. The number 1 reason is [Children are Expensive](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090415/cost-raising-child-america.asp). Like, REALLY EXPENSIVE, and not just in a cash format. As more and more families try to live on two incomes and social expectations of parenting time increase (Dads actually raising their kids and the decrease in stay-at-home moms), the number of kids that can be given an acceptable, by their parents, amount of resources has decreased. These are all amplified in cities, and the [urbanization of (lets say) America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_in_the_United_States) has made this phenomenon worse. So, INTERNAL demographic decline is found in those countries that, 1. have high expectations for how kids will be raised (e.g. higher education and parental involvement), 2. have serious constraints on child care (either Stay-At-Home moms have become rare, working moms is expected, and/or payed childcare is costly). Things like culture and a rise in single living are impacts, but I believe those are driven by the the above two reasons. This can be mitigated by immigration from regions that do NOT have these constraints. Now, on to policy.

The problem with creating policy to fix internal demographic decline is that the solutions are either draconian (force Moms to not work and encourage lower engagement in kids' lives), or expensive (free childcare for all, or NEGATIVE COST childcare for all). Lets get to examples of how this has been tried.

My prime example is Japan, the ultimate in craptastic attempts at reversing demographic death. Japan has continuously increased [Perks](https://qz.com/1646740/japan-wants-to-raise-its-fertility-rate-with-new-perks/), but has not done so aggressively enough nor solved many of the other issues with having kids. Primarily, they have not provided the MASSIVE needed perks to start the baby-making machine. When I speak of perks, I mean FREE childcare, plenty of available time to spend with kids (Japan has a high expectation of childcare), and non-discriminatory practices against those who have kids, especially moms, as children in Japan are expected to end the careers and hopes and dreams of moms (as long as its not being a mom). Until these are solved, Japan will continue having sub-1.45 births per woman.

For a GOOD example look at France. France has a 100% funded childcare system (has a fee for high income families) and affordable colleges, greatly decreasing the impact of children on moms. I am not sure about job discrimination... France has a birth rate just about 2 births per woman, 1/3rd higher than Japan. This is STILL not enough children, as 2.1 births per woman is needed for a stable population

NOTE: when digging through the data on birth rates, populations dove hardest between [1950 and about 1980](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&q=US+birth+rate), which is the real integration of women into the work force. Once being a Mom had significant competition for the time and attention of women, it stopped being so predominant. Check the birth rates in other countries, its about the same time period and lines up with female empowerment movements.

As forcing women out of the work force and into full time baby making is both demeaning and immoral, and most will NOT pay the bills for the massive subsidy programs to approach population stability, countries have resorted to EXTERNAL demographic influences to fix their decline. Yea. Its time to talk **Immigration**.

When internal demographics are declining, we need EXTERNAL injections. And that means Immigration. Lets look at the big mama of immigration, the USA. The USA brings in a CRAP TON more people than any other country, with [20% of All immigration going there and a 14% of the population being foreign born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population). The problem with immigration politically is that for the economic purpose of demographic stability, it is LITERALLY replacing the locals to ensure economic growth. Those guys in Charlotte, NC were not WRONG, but its not Jews who will replace their low-birth-rate expensive-to-raise selves, its [everyone else](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/immigrants-countries-birth-over-time) (set chart to Exclude and click off all boxes). Largely Mexicans, but also a hell of a lot of everybody else. The USA grew by .5% last year, which our 1.8 birth per woman fertility rate does not demonstrate. Other examples, the German ""Migrant Crisis"" or otherwise known as ""why Germany is still growing in population"" (4.9% of world immigrants, 15% foreign born).

[Close to 40% of the population of Japan will be classified as senior citizens by around 2050](http://www.f-jichiken.or.jp/column/H27/yosioka220.html) (Japanese - nice graph in mid page).

[This](https://www.population.sg/articles/what-does-a-01-population-growth-mean-for-singapore-and-our-economy) article sums up the impact of a shrinking population in a Singaporean context, but it may be relevant elsewhere. To summarize it:


* In the short run, wages and job vacancies will both go up, while in the long run economic growth will shift towards being productivity-driven (as opposed to resource-driven).

* The support ratio, defined as the ratio of 20-64yos to 65+yos, will go down as the population ages and there are fewer replacements entering the workforce. Rising demand for social and healthcare services combined with lower tax revenue will lead to a greater share of social spending as a proportion of the budget.


>* Have countries with diminishing populations adopted policies to ameliorate the demographic changes? Is there evidence characterizing their effectiveness?


* The government wants to maintain a measured inflow of foreign workers,  who help to increase the size of the local workforce and also contribute to the budget in the form of taxes, thus lowering the support ratio.


* Policies have been implemented that [make it easier for older workers to retain and re-enter employment, by raising the age after retirement up till which employers are legally obligated to offer re-employment](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2017/0109-improving-re-employment-opportunities-for-older-workers), as well as [incentivize employers to hire older workers by receiving wage-offsets for doing so.](https://www.sec.gov.sg/FAQ/Pages/How-much-Special-Employment-Credit-(SEC\)-can-employers-receive.aspx)

,"we are firmly in the territory of the [demographic transition model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition). I'm not a demographer or an economist, but I took a master's course in demographics and it was fabulous. people have talked a lot in the comments so far about immigration being a part of this issue of lower fertility rates, so I'll just add 2 interesting things I haven't seen mentioned yet:

1. immigration isn't just a way to have population replacement, immigrants are actively cost-saving: in demographics, people who are 15-64 are considered to be working-age (generating economic growth), and people younger & older are considered dependents (draining more resources than they contribute). most immigrants arriving while they're working-aged, so their new country benefits from not having had to spend money on raising them from ages 0-14. of course I'm describing the theory here, not specific situations; specific immigrants may not be working or generally be a net neutral/negative for a society, but overall the theory is that you save money from not having to invest 14 years of resources in order to get a working-age adult. also, immigrants often bring foreign money, which grows the new country's economy independent of their ability to work. and lastly, the benefits of not having to invest in infants/children/teenagers aren't totally free, of course: they are costs borne by the person's previous country & community. oftentimes immigrants are moving to a country with a higher income than their previous country, and this is one of the significant costs of immigration: the country that raised this person spent a chunk of money in getting them to 15, and don't get to reap the full benefits of that investment.
2. this doesn't have to do with the US or Japan per se, but is a significant economic consideration in the course of countries shifting through different stages in the demographic transition model: some countries benefit from a [demographic dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_dividend). basically, there comes a point where fertility rates are falling and life expectancy is rising, and suddenly there's a lot more working age adults (ages 15 - 64) and a lot fewer children, compared to before. so the adults who would've been spending a big chunk of their time on their kids instead of increasing GDP are no longer having to spend so much time rearing children (because of declining fertility), and plus they're spending more years of their lives working (because of rising life expectancy). this extra productivity is called the demographic dividend (here's an [invesopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demographic-dividend.asp) on this very topic). [China is thought to be benefitting from this right now](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-population-destiny-the-looming-crisis/): the demographic dividend ""is estimated to have accounted for 15 to 25 percent of China’s economic growth between 1980 and 2000"". this dividend eventually ends though, as life expectancy rises to be far beyond working age. after all, 65 is pretty young in most high-income countries. elderly people cost money because a) they're not working and are still drawing resources, and b) the older people get, the more expensive their healthcare gets, and healthcare is a major, major cost for a country. even if people work to their 70's, many still live another 10-15 years, and each year is a net cost to the system. which we are also seeing in China right now: growing numbers of working age adults now are needing to support their 2 parents (where they are sole support due to the 1 child policy) and sometimes even 4 grandparents. by support, I don't only mean financial support--the more significant loss is that they can't work because they need to spend a good deal of their time & energy caring for the family members who are 65+.",midnightbikeriders,,f6wdc5,fi9fega

,"I flagged this post to remind me to come back to it and answer.  I would answer your two questions as follows:

(1) an ""initial policy determination"" in this context means a decision/determination that someone ought to proceed THIS way to solve a certain problem as opposed to proceeding THAT way to solve it.  By way of example, suppose we have a problem (the cost of college tuition is very high); if someone were to say ""I've determined that the best way to address the problem is to further subsidize financial aid programs and not raise taxes,"" that would be an initial policy determination that is more likely to be seen in the legislative or executive branches of government, not in the judiciary.  The best way to look at factor 3 of the Baker v. Carr test is through the lenses of factors 1 and 2 (SCOTUS later held in a plurality decision that the factors are likely listed in descending order of both importance and clarity, see [here](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43834.pdf) at pg. 6.  ""Initial policy determinations"" are almost always textually demonstrable commitments of an issue to a coordinate political department (think, e.g., immigration enforcement, health care policy, etc.) or there is a lack of judicial standards for resolving the issue (e.g., what judicial standards do we have to resolve the best way of proceeding to lower the costs of college tuition?  That issue is simply not something the courts are equipped to decide.

(2) The political question ""test"" is similar to what we in the legal field refer to as a ""[balancing test](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/balancing_test).""  Because of the quasi-subjective, quasi-objective nature of legal balancing tests (like the Baker v. Carr factors), it is highly unlikely that there is a case where the court held there was a political question solely because factor 3 of the Baker v. Carr test is met.  I did a quick search on westlaw and was not able to find such a case.  I will also note that the political question doctrine doesn't come up all that often, and when it does, it's usually over high-level constitutional/separation-of-powers issues (e.g., Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297 (1918) (holding that the conduct of foreign relations is the sole responsibility of the Executive Branch); Nixon v. United States (91-740), 506 U.S. 224 (1993) (holding that a claim concerning a Senate impeachment rule violates the Impeachment Trial Clause is nonjusticiable).  See [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine).",atlas1171,,f6egr5,fib2xcr
,"Hi there!

There is no one answer to your first question - it really depends on specific facts. As for your second question, it is typically the case that more than one of those factors are implicated when a court dismisses a case under the PQ doctrine. Factors 2, 3, and 4 are closely related.

I think the best way to illustrate these concepts is through example, and some good examples can be found in the dismissals of recent lawsuits filed by municipalities against fossil fuel companies for their contributions to climate change. Courts have dismissed some of these claims on the grounds that judicial resolution would violate the separation of powers doctrine because it should be left to the elected branches of government to make initial policy decisions about how to allocate the costs of climate change mitigation and adaptation (see, e.g., the district court decision in City of Oakland v. BP).

Granted, the courts in these cases aren't even calling this the ""political question"" doctrine or applying the Baker factors -- but nonetheless, the application of this principle is quite apparent. And I think it's helpful to think about how this doctrine plays out in contemporary lawsuits involving questions of great importance to people today.

\*Edited to clarify that I was referring to the district court decision in City of Oakland v. BP, since that case has been appealed.",KilgurlTrout,,f6egr5,fj2ctnf
,"I think this is slightly misreading the test set forth in _Baker._

The phrase in question is not an ""initial policy"" but an ""initial policy determination.""

That is, does the court initially have to make a determination about policy that is of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion.

So for example, the Constitution clearly sets forth certain policy propositions.  E.g. the [first amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) prohibits establishing a state religion.  So the courts are empowered to determine ""we don't have a state religion"" as a policy of the US, and work from that premise.

But other policy questions are clearly left to the discretion of the political branches.  So for example, the [16th amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) allows for an income tax.  It's not for the courts to determine how high or low that tax should be - it's for Congress through the legislative process to decide that.  

So if in deciding a question about a constitutional challenge to a tax law the courts needed to start from a premise about what the ""right"" or ""fair"" rate of tax is, they would be breaching the 3rd point of the *Baker* ruling.  It is not for the courts to make an initial policy determination about how high or low taxes should be.",huadpe,,f6egr5,fi7ennh

While it's true that the President has tools to commute/pardon sentences, that wouldn't necessarily mean that any action a President took to decrease a sentence, such as pressuring DoJ officials to recommend a lower sentence, would necessarily be legal. For instance, what if instead the President wanted a steeper sentence? They would still be interfering with the sentencing recommendation, but in the opposing way - one couldn't then rely on the existing pardon/commute powers of the Presidency. It seems weird that interfering to lessen a recommendation would be fine, but interfering to increase a recommendation wouldn't - which is why I don't think pointing to the commute/pardon power is a suitable defense. 

I think it would be legal - I'm not aware of any restrictions on the President from doing so, and as another user answered, the DoJ ultimately answers to the President. 

While the White House has traditionally avoided interfering in such decisions, that appears mostly a norm and not any kind of formal law. As described by [Sally Yates](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/12/19/what-kind-country-we-speak-out-core-american-values-sally-q-yates-column/951828001/), former US Deputy AG:

> The rule of law depends not only on things that are written down, but also on important traditions and norms, such as apolitical law enforcement. That’s why Democratic and Republican administrations alike, at least since Watergate, have honored that the rule of law requires a strict separation between the Justice Department and the White House on criminal cases and investigations. This wall of separation is what ensures the public can have confidence that the criminal process is not being used as a sword to go after one’s political enemies or as a shield to protect those in power. It’s what separates us from an autocracy.

-----------------

,"People are approaching this from the wrong direction. The Pardon power is irrelevant here.

The President derives the law enforcement power from the Take Care clause. That was the power used to haul Roger Stone into court in the first place and press for his conviction. After a conviction is secured, [the law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3552) and the [Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_32) both require a Probation Officer (a member of the judicial branch) to provide a Pre-sentence Report laying out the factors affecting sentencing. That part does not involve the DOJ or the President.

Under FRCrP 32 (4)(A), the Court must allow both parties to speak prior to sentencing. The Judge generally orders or allows those parties to file sentencing recommendations prior to that point, but is not otherwise required to accept a paper pleading. 

So the issuance of a DOJ sentencing recommendation is not done pursuant to the President's Article 2 powers, but instead the Court's Article 3 powers. The Court orders/allows the DOJ to respond, so they do. The DOJ can revise its recommendations however the President orders, provided the Court allows them to modify their pleading.

Regarding question #2, the DC Bar has an [ethical rule](https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/amended-rules/rule3-08.cfm) that Prosecutors are required to disclose to the defense any information which might mitigate the Defendant's sentence. It doesn't seem that's what happened here, but it's worth noting that in some situations the President/DOJ would be *required* to intervene and lessen their sentencing recommendation.

The closest thing I could find to an ethical rule on this situation comes from the ABA's [Model Rules for Prosecutors](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/criminal_justice/standards/ProsecutionFunctionFourthEdition/)

>The prosecutor should seek to assure that a fair and informed sentencing judgment is made, and to avoid unfair sentences and disparities.

And

>In the interests of uniformity, the prosecutor’s office should develop consistent policies for evaluating and making sentencing recommendations, and not leave complete discretion for sentencing policy to individual prosecutors.

This would suggest that if the DOJ/President truly believed this would result in an unfair sentence or a single prosecutor went rogue, they should intervene. However, it's not clear whether the DC Circuit adopted that rule. The ABA rule 3-7.3(b) appears in the DC rules almost word-for-word, but the quoted sections do not.",,,f2emhs,fhecsm0

Due to the connections to the President, some might argue it's [obstruction of justice](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2018/08/13/unpacked-presidential-pardons-and-obstruction-of-justice/), but I think most would just do what the founding fathers did and conclude that such conduct could be thought of as [impeachable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/04/21/the-president-himself-may-be-guilty-why-pardons-were-hotly-debated-by-founding-fathers/) NOTE: Washingtonpost link. if the conduct was so egregious. But given that the complaint is over the length of punishment and not that the individual is being punished, that just becomes even more embroiled in the politics of the matter since some don't think non-violent crimes [should even result in jail time](https://time.com/4596081/incarceration-report/) NOTE My apologies for lack of a better source on this claim.

I will note that the DoJ is currently putting forth [on the record](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-expected-to-scale-back-roger-stones-extreme-sentencing-recommendation-official) that they made this decision before the President weighed in on the matter as a matter of completeness in conveying currently available information.

> Is it in compliance with DoJ guidelines for attorneys, or the rules of professional ethics?

Based on the [principles of federal prosecution](https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-27000-principles-federal-prosecution#9-27.730) section on the subject, I would say an answer to this question is up for interpretation and is very subjective. Given that we don't have enough information on what [may or may not have](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-expected-to-scale-back-roger-stones-extreme-sentencing-recommendation-official) gone on behind the scenes yet, it's entirely possible that a supervisory officer ultimately disagreed with the conclusions on the sentencing guidelines and decided to step in for the sake of maintaining the image of fair justice as alluded to in the section I linked to (granted that is entirely up for debate).

Based on the [sentencing memo pg. 16](https://www.lawfareblog.com/federal-prosecutors-recommend-sentencing-roger-stone-seven-nine-years) it seems to me that Stone at minimum was a category I offender who should start with a base offense level of 14, but the additions they add on after that is more open to subjective interpretation that bring the total offense level to 29, for which the recommended sentence would be within the [guidelines](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2016/Sentencing_Table.pdf).",Darkframemaster43,,f2emhs,fhc8kiy

,"The answer to your questions is no, regardless of whether or not the President pressured the DoJ or attorneys to change their position, and regardless of whether or not Stone's conduct related to the President's campaign. 

The President is the head of the executive branch, of which the DoJ is a part.  The DoJ answers to the Attorney General, who in turn answers to the President.  See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice#Organization).  See also, [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-executive-branch/).

Even assuming that the original sentencing memorandum remained in effect, the President would still have nearly-unchecked power to pardon Stone or otherwise commute his sentence.

I am not 100% familiar with all of the DoJ guidelines, but there is nothing in the rules of professional conduct that would preclude this from happening.  This is how the executive branch works, so I expect that there is nothing in DoJ guidelines that would be relevant here.

At least, in the case of Sondland, who was outright fired. In the case of Vindman, who is apparently being moved to another position, 2302 seems to apply, but things are so weird right now with this president. It appears that he is [openly admitting](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51408704) that his actions toward the two men are motivated by retaliation for their behavior in the impeachment trial, which seems to be exactly what these statutes are referring to -- but the media and government officials all seem to be in that bizarre state of confusion that's come to dominate public discourse around Trump's presidency. 

To me, it appears to be a very clear-cut case of criminal retaliation, but there may be some protections for the presidential office that I'm not aware of. Or it may be a case of having to definitively prove the allegation in court, and [sitting presidents are immune from civil lawsuits,](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/presidents-immune-civil-lawsuits-state-court-private-conduct) so I'm not sure how the case would be prosecuted. It might require another impeachment process, which would likely end the same way the first one did, with the republican-controlled Senate shielding the president from legal consequences.

EDIT: reading back over the section of 1513 that I quoted, I notice that it says ""providing to a law enforcement officer any **truthful** information"" -- Trump might be able to argue that since he was acquitted, the information Sondland and Vindman provided was ""not truthful.""",,,f15c54,fh3t5t0
,"Copying my response to the top comment:

I believe I can explain why I think you're mistaken.  Let's unpack the statute to break it down.

18 U.S.C. 1513 relates to retaliation against a witness, victim, or informant in the context of an official proceeding.  ""Official proceeding"" is a defined term, from section 1515 (Definitions for certain provisions; general provision):

> (a) As used in sections 1512 and 1513 of this title and in this section--
(1) the term “official proceeding” means--
(A) a proceeding before a judge or court of the United States, a United States magistrate judge, a bankruptcy judge, a judge of the United States Tax Court, a special trial judge of the Tax Court, a judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims, or a Federal grand jury;
(B) a proceeding before the Congress;
(C) a proceeding before a Federal Government agency which is authorized by law; or
(D) a proceeding involving the business of insurance whose activities affect interstate commerce before any insurance regulatory official or agency or any agent or examiner appointed by such official or agency to examine the affairs of any person engaged in the business of insurance whose activities affect interstate commerce.

""Law Enforcement Officer"" is also a defined term per the statutory scheme: 

> (4) the term “law enforcement officer” means an officer or employee of the Federal Government, or a person authorized to act for or on behalf of the Federal Government or serving the Federal Government as an adviser or consultant--
(A) authorized under law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of an offense; or
(B) serving as a probation or pretrial services officer under this title;

Subsections (a)-(c) of 1513 deal with attempts to kill or harm individuals in ""official proceedings"", with (c) involving such attempts in the context of a criminal case.  The subsection you cite to, (e) provides: 

>Whoever knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.

Subsection (e) is different than (a)-(c) because the former relates solely to retaliation for providing truthful information to a law enforcement officer relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense.  As I see it, there are three (3) reasons why Pres. Trump could not be guilty under this section: (1) the President has plenary power to fire federal officers and employees. [See here](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/28-the-removal-power.html); (2) as far as I am aware, as a factual matter neither Vindman nor Sondland were fired for giving information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense (I have not seen any allegation that the President committed an actual federal crime that is defined in the USC, which is a prerequisite under 1513(e)); and (3) it is arguably the case that neither Vindman nor Sondland were providing their information to a ""law enforcement officer"" as that term is defined by the statute.  There is also an argument to be made over the ""truthful"" criteria, which you mentioned above.  That would be a matter of evidence/proof, but I think it's highly unlikely that their info could be found to be ""truthful"" or ""untruthful"" during a trial on the merits.  All of this is further complicated by the fact that impeachment is not a legal proceeding, but a political one, and commission of a ""crime"" is not necessary for bringing impeachment articles.  See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States).

Lastly, as to 5 USC 2302 (which was recently amended), I am having a tough time understanding how people think that would apply.  I suppose the argument is that Vindman and Sondland were employees of a covered executive agency?  That is certainly not the case with Vindman, who was a member of the NSC.  Nor Sondland, as he was an ambassador to the EU.  The statute itself applies to (1) an executive agency; or (2) the Government Publishing Office.  I mean, it says explicitly:

> (C) “agency” means an Executive agency and the Government Publishing Office, but does not include--
(i) a Government corporation, except in the case of an alleged prohibited personnel practice described under subsection (b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D);
(ii)(I) the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Reconnaissance Office; and
(II) as determined by the President, any executive agency or unit thereof the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, provided that the determination be made prior to a personnel action; or
(iii) the Government Accountability Office;",atlas1171,,f15c54,fh8q0s7
,"A key question to answer here is whether reassignment is really retaliation.  Vimdman was already planning on leaving his current role. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2020/02/07/8e7668a6-4998-11ea-bdbf-1dfb23249293_story.html

> Vindman, who testified during House Democrats’ impeachment hearings, had already informed senior officials at the NSC that he intended to leave his post early — by the end of the month, according to people familiar with his decision. But Trump was eager to make a symbol of the Army officer soon after the Senate acquitted him of the impeachment charges.

However Brad Moss who is a national security lawyer claims reassignment can be retaliation:

 The members of Congress are law makers, not law enforcement officers. While they do have an strong incentive to ensure the law is followed, [Impeachment is a political process with a political remedy](https://youtu.be/uqmhfyH09jM?t=555).

There is a problem, however, stemming from the fact that the [Articles of Impeachment](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/12/politics/impeachment-articles-annotated/) don't refer to any **Federal offense**, but rather a broad interpretation of Constitutional limitations on the conduct of the President.

,"Another lawfare question! I bit at the last one, so I'll bite at this one.

The answer is no, it's not a crime.

[18 USC § 1513](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1513) (the Obstruction of Justice statute) has several parts that don't apply. For §1513 to apply, someone would need to:

* Kill or attempt to kill a witness that was providing testimony - §1513 (a)(1)
* Cause bodily injury due to testimony - §1513 (b)(1)
* Interference of lawful employment in retaliation of providing information to law enforcement - §1513 (e)
* Conspiracy to commit the above - §1513 (f)

To the best of my knowledge, the first two did not occur. Sondland and Vindman are both alive and were not physically harmed as a result of their testimony to Congress. However, there was ""interference"" in their employment (an arguable case for Vindman, but I'll allow it for arguments sake), and a group of people did take part. However, none of these apply because Congress is not law enforcement as required under §1513 (e). [§ 1515 (4)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1515) defines law enforcement as: 

> (4) the term “law enforcement officer” means an officer or employee of the Federal Government, or a person authorized to act for or on behalf of the Federal Government or serving the Federal Government as an adviser or consultant—

> (A) authorized under law to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of an offense; or

> (B) serving as a probation or pretrial services officer under this title;

Similarly, claims of criminality based on [5 USC §2302](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/2302) also come up short, although it's closer than under §1513. §2302 (b)(8)(A)(ii) and (b)(9) would seem to cover the testimony used in Congress- they were testifying about gross mismanagement, gross misuse of funds, abuse of authority, etc. However, in order to be covered by the statute, one has to meet the qualifications under (a)(2)(B):

> (B) “covered position” means, with respect to any personnel action, any position in the competitive service, a career appointee position in the Senior Executive Service, or a position in the excepted service, but does not include any position which is, prior to the personnel action—

> (i) excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character; or

> (ii) excluded from the coverage of this section by the President based on a determination by the President that it is necessary and warranted by conditions of good administration;

Sondland is a political appointee, not a career employee of the State Department, and is thus not covered by the statute. Vindman is is military officer and is not part of the [competitive service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_service) or [Senior Executive Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Executive_Service_(United_States\)).

I'll throw in some other crimes that were not committed:

[18 USC § 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) - Obstruction of Congress. The actions were taken after the testimony was concluded and there are no known attempts to coerce them into not testifying by threatening their jobs.

This was part of Reagan's ""starve the beast"" strategy to get rid of Medicare by essentially forcing hospitals to stop accepting it.

Next is that providers simply can charge more due to regulatory capture. Large hospital networks have merged into mega hospital chains. They use this bargaining power to charge more for this services. These costs are passed on. 

Next is that our administrative costs and processes are absolutely out of control. There are special deals and codes between all parts of the medical supply chain. This causes massive inefficiency.

,"I’ll update with sources in a bit, but Iowa is a bit of a unique case. Iowa uses a caucus system, where groups of residents gather in a meeting area and then group up based on their desired candidate. At this point, numbers are tallied and any candidate beneath the cut-off (I think 15% of the vote) is ruled non-viable. Those who were in non-viable groups then get to split up and go into the groups of the remaining viable candidates.

This is the final tally. Based on these numbers, delegates are assigned proportionally. The issue is, each voting district has a whole number of delegates (who will be represented by real people), and so a delegate can’t be split. Thus, rounding. It follows the rule of “over .5, round up, and under .5 round down.”

So for example, one district had 116 for Sanders, 82 for Warren, and 73 for Buttigieg. This resulted in Sanders with 40.7% of the votes, Warren with 28.8% and Buttigieg with 25.6%. 11 remained undecided. The district had 6 delegates, so we take each candidate’s percentage of 6 to determine their delegates:

Sanders: 2.44

Warren: 1.73

Buttigieg: 1.54

2.44 rounds down to 2, both 1.73 and 1.54 round up to 2.

Then add in that you have districts where candidates split a delegate in such a way that neither has a majority claim to them (no one above .5 or two candidates exactly on it). Random chance is used, such as through a coin flip or drawing names from a hat, to determine who gets the delegate.

How it works: https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/02/iowa-democratic-caucuses-new-rules-and-how-they-work.html

,"Fivethirtyeight explains it [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-iowas-three-different-votes-could-affect-who-wins/) (article written before the caucus):

""\[F\]inal alignment is translated into something called state delegate equivalents, which is the third way that Iowa counts its vote. Until this year, in fact, this was the only way that Iowa counted its vote. It comes from a now archaic process where the caucuses technically served to elect delegates to county conventions, which in turn elected delegates to district conventions and the state convention, which in turn elected delegates to the Democratic National Convention.

This process is no longer used — delegates to the DNC will be elected based on caucus night results. However, state delegate equivalents are still used to determine essentially how much weight each precinct gets in determining DNC delegates.

The catch is that these weights are based on the number of votes that Hillary Clinton got in the general election in 2016 and that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Fred Hubbell got in the 2018 general election. And this can create some distortions. General election turnout is much higher than caucus turnout; 630,000 Iowans voted for Hubbell in 2018 and 650,000 did for Clinton in the general election in 2016. By comparison, 172,000 Democrats participated in the 2016 caucuses. Additionally, a higher share of caucus turnout tends to come from more liberal, upscale, urban and suburban counties and/or counties with colleges and universities, and proportionately less of it from rural counties.

Essentially, then, rural votes are likely to give candidates more bang for the buck in terms of state delegate equivalents. Candidates whose voters are mostly concentrated in liberal, highly populous counties are liable to underperform, conversely. There are various estimates out there as to who this is liable to help or hurt. But my read on the evidence is that Warren and to a lesser extent Sanders are likely to be hurt by it. Warren’s vote is mostly concentrated in upscale suburbs, and Sanders is hoping for big turnout surges in counties with a lot of young voters. Conversely, Klobuchar and Buttigieg have put a lot of emphasis on covering Iowa’s entire map and could benefit from this process. So could Biden, whose voters should be older, more working-class and more rural.""

&#x200B;

tl;dr: State delegate equivalents are assigned based on voting patterns in previous elections and give more power to rural voters.  (It's a lot like the electoral college.)  Increasing turnout (which Sanders tried to do) in a given district doesn't lead to more SDE's, even though it massively increases the popular vote.  Buttigieg focused more on rural areas, particularly counties that flipped from Obama to Trump in 2016, so his voters counted more for SDEs.",dtarias,,ezcd7t,fgmw0nm

,"For the 13 original colonies, [they all had governors in the colonial period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_government_in_the_Thirteen_Colonies). There were also already local legislative assemblies. These colonies all more or less copied the British system of governance, except that the King named the governors and the British Parliament was ultimately sovereign over the colonies. Much has been made of the American Revolution, but the reality is that it wasn't that revolutionary, the American institutions set up for independence were all takes on existing British political Institutions, just adapted to a more republican style of government with a clearer separation of powers.

|Great Britain|United States|13 Colonies|
|:-|:-|:-|
|King|President|Governor|
|Ministers|Cabinet|Governor's staff|
|Parliament|House of Representatives|Legislative assembly|
|House of Lords|Senate|Legislative council|
|Judicial system|Supreme Court|Colonial courts|

The only institution that was really novel was the role of the Supreme Court, in the UK, the supreme court is... Parliament. The US Constitution created a Supreme Court to arbitrate conflicts between the Executive and Legislative, or between the Federal government and the States.

Anyway, the same thing happened in every State, they copied British-style institutions (that they already had) and gave them a republican theme. So at the beginning of US history, all States, which had common political institutions under British rule, evolved into similar republican political institutions as American States.

**What about States that joined after the creation of the US then?** Well, most States actually started as Territories, and these Territories were treated by the Federal government in a way very similar to how the 13 colonies were treated by the UK parliament. The Federal government named a governor, a legislative council and formed a judicial system. When they gained Statehood, [the States had to set up a constitutional convention and adopt a republican constitution that wasn't repugnant to the US Constitution](https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Enabling_Act_of_1802_(Transcript)). And since the territories already had a governor, sometimes a bicameral legislature (Council and Assembly) and courts, they usually just adopted a Constitution that preserved these institutions, simply making them elected by the State rather than appointed by the Federal government.

**Could the States adopt a Parliamentary system?** Well, as long as it's a republican parliamentary system like, say, Germany's, probably. But even Parliamentary systems have governors and presidents, Canada has a governor, Germany and Italy have presidents. It's simply these have a lot less power, with the prime minister being the head of government and exercising executive power. But, well, Americans are used to the Presidential republican system with separation of powers, so you'd run against some pretty entrenched cultural expectations to do so (I don't know what you mean by ""systemic"", that word is more and more used, but it seems to me to be of very vague meaning). 

**Why has no State opted for a proportional electoral system?** I'm guessing this has a lot to do with the size of the States and the date of their founding. Back in the 19th century, electoral districts with FPTP was pretty much the only effective electoral system within the constraints of the period, since it allows for local elections without the need for compiling tons of data on votes.

**Why has no State abandoned its FPTP system for a proportional system?** Well, FPTP systems don't transition easy to proportional representation, especially not when you have two-party systems! The ruling party at any given time has no reason to reform the electoral system for proportional representation, because if they rule, it's because they've benefited from FPTP. Furthermore, a proportional system could result in third parties appearing and getting elected, forcing the two big parties to make coalitions to rule. This represents a loss of power of the two parties on the electorate. Historically, governments that transitioned to proportional systems tend to be formed by parties that feel they are the losers of the FPTP system, notably because there is a significant third party that they feel eats into their support. In a Two-Party system, neither of the two major parties has an interest in adopting proportional electoral systems. If a Progressive Party split off from the Democratic Party so that elections would be 45% GOP, 40% Dem, 15% Prog, you might see Democrats campaign for proportional representation, hoping to create a permanent coalition majority by uniting with the Progressives. Until then, I wouldn't hold my breath.",kchoze,,eyuo1p,fgl661m

,"As a matter of constitutional design, it would probably be a big mistake to more formalize the impeachment trial in the Senate.  I see several reasons for this:

1.  **Congress may need to impeach and remove very quickly, and needs the power to do so.**  A requirement that each side may subpoena and call witnesses or evidence, present a certain amount of argument, or otherwise extend trial procedures could keep a President in office for an extended period of time when they might pose an extreme risk to the republic.  This is less of a concern for non-executive officers, but impeachment as the big gun has to be most concerned with Presidential impeachment, which is where power is most concentrated in a single individual.  A single rogue member of Congress or single rogue Supreme Court justice can't do that much.  A single rogue President can.

 For an example of this, [President Nixon apparently developed a significant drinking problem in the White House.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/john-farrell-nixon-book-excerpt-214954)  If a President had developed a really severe drug or alcohol problem, it might be necessary to get them out very quickly.  It's also not a crime to have a major drinking problem, but might be grounds for impeachment.

2.  **The Senate trial is explicitly not meant to be a criminal trial.**  [Article I, Section 3, Clause 7](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a1_2_5.html) sets forth its clear limits:

 >Judgement in Cases of Impreachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgement and Punishment, according to Law.

 In this context, it is clear the standard is not the same as a criminal court, and the Constitution is specific that the procedures there are not a substitute for indictment, trial, judgment and punishment in a court of law.  As such, it doesn't really fit structurally to make the trial in the Senate mirror the process in a court of law, since the court of law process is still required for criminal punishment as opposed to removal.

3.  **The trend in modern democracies is towards easier removal, not harder.**  The American constitution is [in part modeled on the British system circa the mid 1700s](http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/models-and-stereotypes/anglophilia/horst-dippel-british-and-american-constitutional-and-democratic-models-18th-20th-century) with the President in many important respects taking on the role of the King.  However, the British moved away from that model greatly in the 19th century, abandoning the [ancient power to impeach](https://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/history/REPORTS/tc2TNAEXEC.PDF) and replacing it with a much broader system of requiring the confidence of the elected house(s) of the legislature.  In a confidence system like the modern British system, no criminality or abuse of power is required to remove an executive officer.

,"[Here's](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/14/trump-senate-impeachment-trial-process-how-the-rules-work-098226) an excellent article from Politico that breaks down the rules and process as defined for President Trump's impeachment trial as related to President Clinton's impeachment trial.  By the read, Witnesses are an optional portion of the trial (0-7 days according to the article) and must be voted in.  This would indicate that witnesses are at the mercy of the majority.

Of interest is the similarities to Clinton's impeachment where [both Schumer and McConnell have swapped positions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/impeachment-strategies-what-comes-around-goes-around-11576848661).  McConnell in 1999, ""it’s certainly not unusual to have a witness in an impeachment trial.""  Schumer, when still in the house in 1998, ""the president will call witness after witness because he can and because to defend himself, he must."" And then during the Senate trial 1999, “no good case” for bringing witnesses and said Republicans were “more interested in political theater than in actually getting to the bottom of the facts.”  Schumer explained his stance at a Capitol Hill press conference this week, saying that the witnesses in 1999 had already given grand jury testimony, and that the four witnesses Democrats have requested this time have not previously testified.

IMO, it is the ability to control a section of the impeachment trial through a lens of partisanship that needs some ratification.  

The issue with using criminal trials is they require [criminal elements to be met](https://open.lib.umn.edu/criminallaw/chapter/4-1-criminal-elements/) for a conviction.  However, ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" [has no such elements](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/High+Crimes+and+Misdemeanors), and is effectively a lower bar than criminal, including [ordinary crimes, treason, corruption, abuse of power, ordinary incompetence and misbehavior in relation to foreign policy](https://time.com/5745616/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors/) going back to British Parliament law in 1376.  As written by [Hamilton in Federalist Paper No 65](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed65.asp), ""The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.""  Or effectively, crimes and other offenses that may not be criminal that abuse or violation of some public trust.  Which makes sense as one would hold positions of power to a higher standard.

,"My personal take on why the founding fathers wrote out the impeachment process the way that they did was that they feared exactly the type of political landscape that exists today.

This is what the election process is about. No matter how angry you are, your anger doesn't cancel other people's participation in the democratic process.

&#x200B;

I don't think that is an accurate telling of the current impeachment.  Should the Senate vote on the impeachment articles as voted on in the house? is a better question.  The role of the senate is not to investigate, that is the SOLE responsibility of the house.  During the clinton impeachment, the only witnesses called had already provided testimony to either the house investigation, or the special counsel.  There were no NEW witnesses. As far as the Schumer line of ""no witnesses, and no documents"" there were over 22k documents submitted for consideration, as well as the house [Report](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20191216/CRPT-116hrpt346.pdf).  But what is interesting, is Schiff has not released the testimony of one [Last Witness](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/23/michael-atkinson-testimony-concealed-adam-schiff/) from the investigation, Attkinson.   So if there is no witnesses or documents, then the house should not have voted on their articles of impeachment, because the senate is trying the case as presented by the house through the articles.  Not to mention the white house counsel was not allowed to cross examine 14 of the 18 witnesses, which on its face seems wildly inappropriate to the accused.

So I think a more neutral interpretation is, is it the responsibility of the trying body or the investigative body to conduct that portion of the impeachment?  

&#x200B;

My view is the senate should be trying the case as voted on in the house, and should not be used to complete the investigation the house chose not to, because in the case of Bolton, they KNEW they wanted him.  he is not a new player to the investigation, the house did not pursue the avenues available to them in getting Bolton to testify.",CommaHoarder,,eybj3d,fgmcnxy

,"This thread's already a week old, but this is a point worth adding, because it's not been discussed yet, and rarely gets discussed in ERA discussions:

>The original deadline for ratification was March 1979, which was later extended to June 1982.

The extension of the original ERA deadline is absolutely central to the argument of ERA advocates that the deadline could be retroactively extended today.

The problem is that the original extension was almost certainly unconstitutional. Congress proposed the amendment with a seven-year sunset period, and that was understood at the time to be part of the amendment itself (as had been the case with previous sunset periods). In 1978, Congress purported to pass a three-year extension by simple majority -- but, to modify a proposed amendment sitting before the states would ordinarily require Congress to pass a new proposal under Article V, on a two-thirds majority.

The 1979 extension was challenged in court, and challengers appeared likely to succeed. In [*State of Idaho v. Freeman*](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/529/1107/2355452/), a federal district court ruled that the extension was unconstitutional and invalid, and that the ERA expired in 1979, as originally scheduled. This case died at the district court level because, in 1982, the extension expired, and so the whole case was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court as moot -- but, had the case continued, it sure looked like an uphill battle for ERA advocates.

Moreover, the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court considered the case moot strongly suggests that the Supreme Court believed that, after the ERA expired in 1982, it could not be revived through some retroactive act of Congress. If Congress had had that power, the case could have continued toward some conclusion. 

So *Freeman* gets at not one but two really important problems for ERA ""three-state solution"" advocates: their whole argument is premised on the notion that Congress can unilaterally change ratification deadlines retroactively, even decades after the fact. Their chief argument in favor of this is the fact that Congress once *pro*actively changed a ratification deadline. 

But since *even that* proactive change was hotly disputed at the time and was unlikely to survive judicial review, it seems frankly unreasonable for ERA advocates to suggest that the courts would (or could or should) uphold a *retroactive* change to the deadline -- especially when a far more liberal Supreme Court in the 1980s implicitly ruled that retroactive changes are indeed impossible.

I fear that the only thing ERA ""three-state solution"" advocates are accomplishing is setting themselves up for a devastating letdown that will further erode faith in America's struggling institutions, in large part because ERA leaders, advocates, and even supposedly neutral reporters are simply ignoring large swaths of the record that pose major obstacles to the ERA.

(ERA supporters *also* need courts to agree that state ratification rescissions are unconstitutional, or at least are under Congress's sole jurisdiction. The *Freeman* court held against them on this point as well -- and allowing the rescissions to stand would kill the ERA even if Congress were allowed to retroactively change the deadline. This is often dismissed as a settled matter or a minor procedural point, but it's a *major* unanswered question in constitutional law whose outcome is not even remotely clear. Again: ERA supporters are being misinformed by a leadership and press that insists on presenting the ERA's prospects in the sunniest light possible.)

((The reality is that the odds ERA supporters prevail on *any* of these questions before the current Supreme Court is roughly 0%. Even if you rewind ten years, back to when moderates Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy routinely voted with the liberals to form a liberal majority, the odds of a Supreme Court majority supporting ALL of the points the ERA needs to survive would be remote at best.))",BCSWowbagger2,,euvd2f,fggl1zq

Not a lawyer here, but is there not a legal distinction between sex and gender?",memed0ut,,euvd2f,ffsck4h
,">Does Virginia's adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment make it law?

(Not a legal scholar.)

So Article V. of the [Constitution](https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf) states that ""The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution... which... shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States."" (Leaving out the convention process here because it's not being used.)

So based on this section, the Constitution doesn't appear to grant Congress any authority in the amendment process beyond it's ability to *begin* the ratification process, but it also doesn't appear to explicity *deny* them broader authority over the proposal process either. Like, perhaps one could argue that the deadline in the preamble still falls under ""shall propose.""

However, the tenth amendment also states that ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""

So Article V. doesn't seem to grant Congress the explicit authority to set deadlines, and Amendment 10 seems to imply that, because of of this lack of explicit authority, the states have sole power in ratifying the amendment on their own terms (as long as 3 / 4 of them do it). I am not sure though. (E: though perhaps if ratification deadlines *do* fall under the purview of ""shall propose,"" maybe the authority to ignore ratification deadlines passed by Congress *is* ""prohibited by \[the Constitution\] to the States?"")

>What, if any, legal precedent exist to support the pro-ERA supporters belief that the deadline does not apply?

I'm not sure if this counts, but I guess one could argue that there is precedent over not having any preamble at all, and furthermore, that any time-based provisions (such as the date upon which amendments take effect, and ratification deadlines) have always been placed into the amendments themselves, as opposed to being tacked on in the preamble.

Section 3 of the Eighteenth Amendment states, for example, that ""This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as  an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of the several  States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the  date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.""

And Sections 5 and 6 of the Twentieth Amendment state, respectively that ""Sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th day of October following the ratification of this article,"" and ""This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as  an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of  the several States within seven years from the date of its submission.""

I don't know if precedent for as to how amendments were written and passed in the past carries the same weight as precedent in the courts/judiciary, which is more what I think you were wondering about if I understand your question right. IMO, the Article V. + Amendment X is stronger case for valid ratification than the ""Ratification deadlines have never been done that way before, so they can't be that way at all"" argument (E: but see the above edit). Though again, this isn't intended speak to the weight of the precedent of judicial interpretation here, only to precedent over how amendments have been written and passed so far.

TLDR: IMO this issue comes down to how broadly the phrase ""The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, **shall propose Amendments** to this Constitution"" grants Congress authority of the ratification over the amendment.

Because this phrase seems to be *pretty* specific, I don't think it grants Congress the authority to set ratification deadlines in plain bills (which cannot go against the Constitution; the preamble is part of only the bill itself, and not the amendment) although perhaps these deadlines *could* be considered as part of the proposal process, and thus valid.",very_loud_icecream,,euvd2f,ffrywto

Feeling badly burned in the wake of *Obergefell* and abjectly horrified that *Hobby Lobby* (which seemed like an easy case to this cohort) was decided by a bare majority, and with an alarming open seat on the Supreme Court, protecting Antonin Scalia's seat from the likes of Merrick Garland became paramount. Taking conservative control of the court by replacing one of the liberal justices (or centrist Kennedy) was high-priority, and the appellate system was also a major issue. (EDIT: See [here](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/christians-arguing-trump/), very generally, for example)

Despite [real doubts](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/30/14439220/thomas-hardiman-souter) among conservatives (and some [very surprising judicial interventions](https://www.jamesjheaney.com/2018/09/28/my-chat-with-judge-hardiman-or-harriet-miers-and-the-hasty-tweet/)), Trump has delivered. Justice Gorsuch has proved himself as a conservative textualist and is universally expected to endorse the pro-lifers' view of the law in *June Medical Services v. Gee*. Justice Kavanaugh, who replaced the [widely](https://spectator.org/anthony-kennedy-reagans-worst-mistake/) [reviled](https://www.conservativereview.com/news/no-anthony-kennedy-it-is-you-who-destroyed-democracy/) Anthony Kennedy, has [relatively strong abortion credentials](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/brett-kavanaugh-ruling-in-garza-v-hargan-case-about-due-process/) as well. Although nothing can truly ease conservatives' insecurity before the ruling (the lesson of *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*'s shocking outcome has been too well-learned), my own observation is that the pro-life movement has not been this (cautiously) optimistic since the federal legislative wins of 2002-2005. [Few expect *Roe*](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/supreme-court-unlikely-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/) to be overturned in the near future, but most expect state legislatures will be given additional running room to regulate abortion. Likewise, *Obergefell* seems unlikely to tumble, but the recent [slate of religious freedom cases](https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/01/justices-add-three-new-hours-argument-calendar/) suggests that conservatives have less to fear about what *Obergefell* means for their ability to live and work in American society.

Meanwhile, on the lower courts, President Trump has apparently recognized that judicial conservatives are both a big part of his base and very easily appeased, and he and Sen. McConnell have been a machine that confirms textualists to the bench. Just as George W. Bush (327 confirmed appointments; 63 appellate or above) nearly cancelled out Bill Clinton's influence on the federal bench (Clinton had 378 confirmed appointments; 66 appellate or above), President Trump has been racing to cancel out President Obama's influence. Obama saw 329 confirmed, with 57 at the appellate level or above, over the course of 8 years. President Trump has 187 confirmed judges, including 52 at the appellate level or above -- which would be respectable production for a president in his sixth year, but is downright jaw-dropping for a president in his third year.

Should Trump lose re-election, he will likely manage to appoint and confirm as many judges during his one term as Obama did in two -- perhaps a few more. Trump's judicial legacy will likely be continuing the U.S. judiciary's decades-long pattern of relative ideological stasis, with movement to one side quickly being cancelled out by movement to the other.

On the other hand, if Trump wins re-election, maintains control of the Senate until at least 2022 (as seems likely in any universe where he wins re-election), and continues to appoint judges at this pace and with this consistency, his legacy is likely to be the most dramatic ideological shift of the U.S. judiciary in decades, on the same order as the [switch in time that saved nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_switch_in_time_that_saved_nine) but in a quite different direction.",BCSWowbagger2,,erhye1,ff9xrwd

,"**Trade**

The Trump administration has used [tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_tariffs) to push trading partners to renegotiate their trade agreements with the US. Here's a brief summary of how that has gone:

* North America — The [United States Mexico Canada Agreement](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/3/17930092/usmca-mexico-nafta-trump-trade-deal-explained) (USMCA) is an updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which had been [controversial since before its bipartisan passage in 1993,](https://www.thebalance.com/history-of-nafta-3306272) but was also seen to be largely [beneficial by most economists.](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/free-trade) The updated agreement leaves most of NAFTA intact, but raises ""country of origin"" requirements for automobile components, increases labor rates and protections (mostly targeting Mexico), gives US farmers more access to the Canadian dairy market, and increases intellectual property and digital trade protections. The new deal is also subject to more frequent review and includes a sunset clause.
* China — The US trade deficit with China had been [increasing for 30 years.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/05/more-than-30-years-of-us-trade-with-china-in-one-chart/) The US economy had become so reliant on Chinese goods that [prior administrations were reluctant to get tough with China over long-standing disputes.](https://web.archive.org/web/20181205153640/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/06/american-presidents-have-a-long-history-of-walking-back-tough-talk-on-china/?utm_term=.f3649180619b) The Trump administration believed something had to be done and it was best to do so [while China was still more reliant on the US market than the US was on the expanding Chinese market.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/cramer-remix-china-needs-us-more-than-we-need-china.html) At least [one prominent Democrat agreed with the administration's tactics,](https://thehill.com/policy/international/392636-schumer-on-china-tariffs-china-needs-us-more-than-we-need-them) which appear to have [driven the Chinese to the negotiating table.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/china-slowdown-vs-us-strength-may-cause-china-to-fold-in-trade-war-nomura.html) Just this past week, the US and China signed [""phase one"" of a trade deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-14/phase-one-china-u-s-trade-deal-what-s-in-and-what-s-missing) after a long exchange of escalating tariffs. It's still not clear what is and isn't in the deal. It's also not clear how much of an effect this will have on the US economy, as it's estimated that the year-plus trade war only [cost the US 0.04% of its GDP.](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/1/1/5626442) Time will tell.
* Europe — Although the administration had [previously announced its intention to strike new trade deals in Europe,](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/october/trump-administration-announces) not much has happened on that front since [the 2018 ""trade truce.""](https://www.axios.com/trump-trade-war-european-union-truce-99d8f967-2440-42a5-aaad-d65bebbd46dd.html) The one deal being touted by the administration is a resolution to the long-standing dispute over [US beef exports.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/trump-trade-announcement-on-eu.html)
* South Korea — The [KORUS FTA was signed in 2007, renegotiated in 2010, and renegotiated again under Trump.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Korea_Free_Trade_Agreement) Experts are pretty down on both the [need to have renegotiated KORUS](https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/was-the-korea-us-fta-really-a-horrible-deal/) and the potential [effects of the agreed changes.](https://thediplomat.com/2018/09/korus-revision-does-little-for-us-less-for-koreans/)
* Japan — In September of 2019, the [US and Japan signed a trade deal](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-japan-trade-deal) that lowers Japanese barriers to imported US agricultural goods and reduces US tariffs on imported Japanese industrial goods. Many of the previsions were lifted out of the larger TPP deal, which was abandoned when the US pulled out of negotiations in 2017.

,"**The Environment**

His environmental policy seems ruled by [de-regulation.](https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/tracking-deregulation-in-the-trump-era/) 

Some notable regulations removed:  
- Clean Power Plan  
- Methane Rule  
- Clear Air Act: Emissions Standards  
- Oil and Natural Gas Emissions Standards  
- Coal Ash Rule

He is extremely critical of renewable energy, even [promoting false conspiracy theories](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/apr/08/donald-trump/republicans-dismiss-trumps-windmill-and-cancer-cla/) against them.

He's notoriously skeptical of climate change, once [claiming it was a ""Chinese Hoax.""](https://time.com/5622374/donald-trump-climate-change-hoax-event/).

This is curious since his *own administration* has extensively studied and confirmed its existence and scale. The [Fourth National Climate Assesment](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/) is a massive document, using thousands of studies from different entities to detail the effects climate change has on America. The opening statement: 

>Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.

[NASA is equally confident](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/)

>The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.

He has a dubious track record with natural disasters, including increased hurricanes and wildfires - largely [passing blame](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/trump-again-misunderstands-californias-wildfires/) rather than solutions or unity.

The U.S. [withdrew from the Paris Accord](https://www.state.gov/on-the-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement/), making America the only country apart from Syria to break ranks.

His de-regulation agenda is further evidenced by his cabinet picks:

•[*Scott Pruitt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pruitt) - Former Head of The Environmental Protection Agency - An oil lobbyist who had personally sued and fought the EPA for years in the interest of fossil fuel entities. He resigned in shame, and under multiple investigations.

,"#Immigration

This was a [major campaign issue](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/15/donald-trumps-top-10-campaign-promises/) for Trump, and something the administration has engaged in a lot of policymaking on.  I will break this down into three parts:

1. Changes to legal immigration pathways
2. Border policy
3. Interior immigration enforcement

##Changes to legal immigration pathways

###Executive Policy

Through executive branch policymaking, the Trump Administration has sought to drastically reduce the number of people who can legally immigrate to the US.  

* **Travel ban:** The Trump administration has [used a series of executive orders to enact some nationality-based restrictions on immigration.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13780)  This began with a quite broad executive order banning nationals of [seven majority Muslim countries, excepting a prioritization for members of minority religions there.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769) which was seen by many as a part of his [campaign promise](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/08/trump-website-takes-down-muslim-ban-statement-after-reporter-grills-spicer-in-briefing.html) ""calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.""  Following the [9th circuit striking down the first ban under the 5th amendment](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf) a third version was [ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf)

* **Refugee Resettlement:**  The Trump administration has [drastically cut refugee resettlement targets](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/trump-refugees.html) from a high of 110,000/year under President Obama to 18,000/year most recently.  In addition [a policy was proposed, but has been blocked in court so far](https://www.kxxv.com/hometown/texas/federal-judge-blocks-policy-that-allowed-gov-greg-abbott-to-ban-refugees-in-texas) which would allow states to ban refugees from being resettled in their state.

* **Public charge rule:** The Trump administration proposed a change which would [make it much harder to immigrate without showing substantial financial resources, and threatens permanent residents with deportation for using certain government benefits.](https://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/final-rule-public-charge-ground-inadmissibility)  Critics of the rule have alleged that [it has already deterred immigrants from seeking benefits.](https://www.vox.com/2019/8/12/20802613/trump-public-charge-immigration-rule-change-explained-marielena-hincapie)  The rule has been blocked by several federal courts, but has not been finally resolved by the Supreme Court.

###Legislative policy

Very little has happened during the Trump administration legislatively on immigration policy.  There were some negotiations about DREAMers (people brought to the US illegally as minors and who were raised in the US) which were a part of [a government shutdown in late 2018-early 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/19/trump-declares-national-emergency-over-immigration-amid-border-wall-push.html) but ultimately [there was no major immigration change and the shutdown ended.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/01/26/as-the-u-s-government-reopens-pay-attention-to-these-3-things/)

The Trump administration has [proposed a legislative framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trumps-bold-immigration-plan-21st-century/) to drastically cut visas for family reunification, which [would reduce family visas by about 317,000 per year.](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/trump-immigration-plan-lopsided-proposal) But there has not been anything done with it besides proposing it.  The [RAISE Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-backs-raise-act/) which the White House has said they support [has had no action since introduction.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1103/actions?q={%22search%22:[%22RAISE+act%22]}&r=46&s=3&KWICView=false)

##Border Policy

* **Border Wall:** Trump campaigned on a promise to [build a wall along the US/Mexico border, and make Mexico pay for it.](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1397/build-wall-and-make-mexico-pay-it/)  This has largely not happened.  As of [August last year](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/aug/30/donald-trumps-border-wall-how-much-has-really-been/) fencing has only been built to replace old sections of dilapidated fencing along the border, not new miles of wall.  The US government paid for the replacements, not Mexico.

* **Asylum claims at the border:**  A major policy change has been in how the US treats asylum claimants at the border.  The Trump administration has gone through several phases on this.  For a period of time, policy was [to detain minors and family units in the US.](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/31/728822381/immigrant-advocates-ask-court-to-release-unaccompanied-minors-detained-in-florid)  This led to [massive overcrowding and major humanitarian issues at detention facilities.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/border-center-migrant-detention.html)

 More recently, the administration has implemented a policy of forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while awaiting their hearings, and do [teleconference hearings](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/07/09/remain-mexico-program-expands-laredo-texas/) at US ports of entry.  Recent reports are that [0.1% of the asylum claims are granted, versus about a 20% grant rate for asylum claims from the same countries through the prior process.](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/story/2019-12-15/remain-in-mexico-has-a-0-01-percent-asylum-grant-rate)  In addition, [the conditions in camps and facilities on the Mexican side of the border are often squalid and unsafe.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawmakers-condemn-horrific-conditions-faced-by-asylum-seekers-returned-to-mexico-2020-01-17/)

* **Family Separation**  Another major (though brief) initiative the Trump administration pushed was a policy of [using criminal cases to separate families who arrive illegally at the border outside ports of entry.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration_family_separation_policy)  By charging parents/guardians with misdemeanor [illegal entry](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1325) charges, they would force their children to be separated from them.  The administration [did not have specific plans for how to reunify children with their parents after separating them.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/politics/family-separations-reunification-never-plan-court/index.html)  After about 3 months of the family separation program [Trump signed an executive order to end it.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-signs-executive-order-immigrant-families/story?id=56029396)

##Interior immigration enforcement

* **DACA:** The largest change the Trump administration undertook has been an attempt to rescind the [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals)  The program was initiated under the Obama administration and gives work permits and a deferral from deportation to DREAMers (persons brought to the US as minors illegally).  Currently courts have blocked rescission of the program and the [case is before the Supreme Court.](https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/11/argument-preview-justices-to-review-dispute-over-termination-of-daca/)

* **Attempts to expand expedited removal.** The Trump administration has published rules to attempt to apply ""expedited removal"" rules to more illegal immigration cases, though [courts have also temporarily blocked those rules.](https://www.aila.org/advo-media/aila-practice-pointers-and-alerts/trump-administration-expands-expedited-removal)",huadpe,,erhye1,ff3v2ju
,"On appointments of Agency positions, Trump has not done well. He's relying on a record number of acting directors.

,"Suleimani’s assassination was a big victory for both the administration and the American people. Though Suleimani’s assassination was a dangerous and escalatory move, the following events played out great for the US, with virtually no damage being done to US assets in the region. Iran also experienced further humiliation with Iran accidentally shooting down a plane with 180 people on board, killing all of them. 

For now, Trump’s assassination has done damage to Iran’s proxy network of militias and other terrorist organizations for virtually nothing in exchange, though the overall institution remains. Iraq’s vote to expel US troops is a concern, but Iraq’s had ties with Iran for quite some time now, and it’s nothing unexpected. The US is unlikely to leave either, so it’s not that important.

Overall, disregarding potential Iranian attacks in the future, this was a huge victory, and this is one of the cases in where Trump’s more haphazard approach to foreign policy payed out dividends.

>(A) the release of $391 million of United States taxpayer funds that Congress had appropriated on a bipartisan basis for the purpose of providing vital military and security assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression and which President Trump had ordered suspended; and

>(B) a head of state meeting at the White House, which the President of Ukraine sought to demonstrate continued United States support for the Government of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.

>(3) Faced with the public revelation of his actions, President Trump ultimately released the military and security assistance to the Government of Ukraine, but has persisted in openly and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to undertake investigations for his personal political benefit.

Trump’s defense points to the fact that [the articles of impeachment do not point to a specific crime] (https://us.cnn.com/2020/01/19/politics/alan-dershowitz-impeachment-trial-sotu-cnntv/index.html), like the ICA, as reasoning why the impeachment is a “sham.” However, the same members making these arguments have a history of statements such as [‘a president does not have to commit a ""technical crime"" in order for it to constitute impeachable conduct.’] (https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/20/politics/alan-dershowitz-trump-defense-criminal-like-conduct/index.html) (Alan Dershowitz, Trump’s legal team) and [“it doesn’t even have to be a crime”] (https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article230606129.html) (Lindsay Graham, Republican Senator). The current focus on the ‘technical legality’ of what Trump is impeached for seems an interesting defense, based on historical arguments.",Bd_wy,,er33j2,ff4yxkj
,"The President is not on trial for statutory crimes because impeachment is not a criminal proceeding.

If he committed federal crimes during his presidency, he could instead be indicted and prosecuted by the appropriate district office of the Justice Department - except [that cannot happen while he is still the President, according to Department policy](https://www.newsweek.com/olc-opinion-mueller-doj-memo-indict-trump-sitting-president-1450896), so that process would have to wait until he leaves office (if the statute of limitations has not expired by then). That said, as another comment notes there is no specified criminal penalty for violating the ICA so no one is going to prison for it now or later. It's one of those laws that normal administrations would just follow because it's the law, or perhaps it could be enforced by a civil suit if the President had continued breaking the law and Congress sued to make him stop, but then that would just depend on whether he's willing to follow a court order after refusing to follow the law itself.

Anyway, rather than a criminal process, impeachment is an analogous political process, the punishment for ""high crimes and misdemeanors"". [That is a legal concept older than the US Constitution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/watergatedoc_2.htm): they're not a special ""high"" category of crimes and misdemeanors, but rather the unique crimes and misdemeanors that can only be committed by someone in a position of high power. Thus there is no statute that delineates every possible high crime and misdemeanor that can be committed by a federal officer. Congress decides what rises to that level on a case-by-case basis.

And [history shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States#Formal_federal_impeachment_investigations_and_results) several examples in which Congress impeached federal officers for high crimes and misdemeanors that are not statutory crimes or misdemeanors. For example, two judges were impeached for persistent drunkenness and poor rulings resulting from it (one was removed from office and one resigned). Drunkenness and poor judgment are not usually crimes, but they are conduct unbecoming of any federal officer and impeachment is the mechanism for dealing with that. Whether or not their behavior was also against the law is irrelevant, because federal officers are held to a higher standard of behavior than simply not breaking the law, and the law cannot encompass every way that civil servants may abuse the public trust.",Epistaxis,,er33j2,ff9sl4s
,"> What acts specifically will the President be on trial for that violated the ICA? Where I am confused is if the president is charged with the **crime** of withholding of the funds or is he being impeached with the **crime** of failing ""to report promptly to Congress all withholdings of budget authority

> If the impeachment charge is not for the **crime** of actual withholding the funds but is for the **crime** of failing to ""promptly report the withholding to Congress""

> Politifact claims that the **crime** was the withholding of the funds.

I want to clarify something with OP's questions: violations of the ICA are not a crime.

There are no criminal punishments. No one can be personally or collectively criminally liable.

The way to enforce the ICA is defined in [2 USC § 687](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/687), and is basically for the Courts to order that the budget be spent correctly by the offending person or agency.

,"It depends on the policy.  In order of easiest to hardest:

**Redistributive tax policy**  

The [16th amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxvi) gives Congress plenary power to implement an income tax, which could include a quite progressive income tax with high rates.  Historically, top marginal rates have been [as high as 90% in the past](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/15/bernie-sanders/income-tax-rates-were-90-percent-under-eisenhower-/) so there would be plenty of room for higher taxes within the bounds of the Constitution.  

Likewise the [Spending Power of Article I Sec. 8 to provide for the ""general welfare""](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13878865053463720829&q=spending+power&hl=en&as_sdt=3,33#[7]) gives Congress the power to spend money in the Treasury without too many limits as long as it doesn't violate some other specific restriction (E.g. the Congress can't spend money to establish a national church because of the [establishment clause.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause))

But raising income taxes on high earners and using it to boost Social Security payments or SNAP benefits could be quite re-distributive and totally constitutional.

**Medical policy**

Here it gets a little trickier.  The government can tax and spend, which allows a lot of healthcare policy to get done, but its ability to regulate the healthcare industry is a bit more circumscribed.

It seems pretty clear that Congress could implement an income tax and a ""Medicare for All"" program where all Americans could choose to enroll in a free Medicare program to provide health insurance.  The questions then are:

* Can Congress mandate people join Medicare-for-All?; and

* What can Congress do to incentivize or compel hospitals and doctors to take Medicare-for-All?

On the first point, Congress could implement a tax penalty for people who fail to enroll in Medicare-for-All like they did for [the ACA mandate.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11973730494168859869&q=nfib+v+sebelius&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33&as_vis=1)  But the penalty would have to be not so large as to be coercive, and just provide an incentive.

On the second point, Congress could use the structure of the EMTALA, a law which requires a hospital taking Medicare money to provide certain emergency services regardless of ability to pay.  Essentially, Congress could make Medicare-for-All and all-or-nothing deal.  That is, if a doctor chooses to take any Medicare-for-All patients, they must take all Medicare-for-All patients.  A doctor or hospital could choose to run on pure private payments, but Congress could lock them out of any Federal health insurance program payments if they chose not to take M4A patients. This structure was [recently upheld by the 11th circuit court of appeals.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16268973573089732898&q=Baker+County+Medical+Services&hl=en&as_sdt=4,121)",huadpe,,emszmj,fdqt8gx
,"I think you're conflating a few things so it's hard to suss out exactly what you're asking.

Are you wondering if it's illegal to implement socialist policies and have them enacted without them being touted as illegal and against the constitution?

Or

Are you arguing if the constitution would uphold rights that align with socialist ideals (i.e. wealth redistribution via taxes, social healthcare and the like)?

The latter is a likely a complex 'it depends', largely on how well a set of lawyers could argue for or against certain pieces of the constitution. For instance, does 'life liberty and the pursuit of happiness' equate to an equitable distribution of wealth or at least social services to allow people to be able to pursue happiness?

Is it against the constitution to put poor people in a situation where it's nearly impossible for them to find happiness without caring for their health?

It could be argued either way. This is how a lot of things change back and forth. 

One such interesting case involves taxation and interstate commerce and how the court interpreted the constitution and law

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn

This is a perfect example how important supreme court justices are, depending on your personal viewpoints and wishes. The constitution could literally mean anything you want it to mean, regardless of what words are on it. It would come down to the ultimate law of the land to determine if they agree or not.

Even 1984 uses quasi-liberalist viewpoints encased in a tyrannical autocracy.

Unfortunately most sources that cover this issue seem to think that expanded federal power due to the commerce clause is a *bad* thing, but I want to be clear - I personally do not think this.

,"> Does the US constitution allow for federal interference on welfare, medical care, tax redistribution on an individual level and so on?

Not to sound dismissive, but we already interfere on welfare, medical care, and our tax system is redistributive (i.e. if you don't make a lot of money, we have refundable tax credits for you, like the [earned income tax credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit) and if you have a certain amount of income, we have special taxes just for you like [the additional medicare tax](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/questions-and-answers-for-the-additional-medicare-tax) ).  The degree to which we do this isn't really outlined or prohibited by anything, but it is interesting that doubling the federal budget is a popular solution among many democratic candidates let alone palatable one. 

The question you might want to pursue: Is a wealth tax constitutional? specifically, does the federal government have the power to tax you for simply having money?

Another fun look might be at the writing of the Constitution and Locke's *Two Treatises of Government*  where rather than our ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"", it was ""Life, Liberty, and property.""  However, it gets fuzzy as when we were writing the constitution, property also meant human beings as far as a number of states were concerned.

The Pew report shows that 80% of this form of transfers go to households earning over $100,000, which is probably not what we want. The total money transferred in this manner is about [$1.4 trillion per year](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-federal-tax-expenditures).

,"This is a difficult question to answer.  The Constitution creates a framework of governance, [federal republicanism](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic). It sets out the powers reserved to the federal government (legislative (Art I), executive (Art II), and judiciary (Art III), the relationship between the states and the feds in relation to the states[](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic) (Art IV).  See [here](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript).  It cannot be stated enough times that the US is not a democracy, it is a federal republic.  The Constitution explicitly requires that the federal government guarantee to each state in the union a ""republican form of government.""  See [here](https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/4/essays/128/guarantee-clause).  That clause is oft-forgotten and not really enforced, but as a starting point it is worth considering.

The difficulty in answering your questions comes in interpreting the provisions of the Constitution in the context of specific/concrete examples of ecnomic and social ""interventions"" (as you call them).  Nothing in the Constitution says ""thou shalt not have a social democracy like in Scandinavia"" etc. etc.  However, certain ""social democratic"" policies may well conflict with certain Constitutional provisions (e.g. the full ""democratization"" of the economy, a proposal Bernie Sanders has floated, would likely run afoul of several provisions). See, e.g., [here](https://ij.org/ll/june-2000-volume-9-number-3/how-the-constitution-protects-economic-liberty-part-three/).

I myself do not support many of the ""social democrat"" policy proposals.  However, the Constitution provides a mechanism such that a generally popular policy or idea has the potential of becoming an amendment through Art V.  See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States#Article_Five).

> There was nothing to suggest to the Iraqis that it was unsafe for Soleimani to travel to Baghdad – quite the contrary. This suggests that Trump helped lure the Iranian commander to a place where he could be killed. It is possible that the president was unaware of the crucial role that Soleimani was playing in the attempted rapprochement with the Saudis. Or that he knew but did not care.

Is this a case of [perfidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy)?

> [In the context of war, perfidy is a form of deception in which one side promises to act in good faith (such as by raising a flag of truce) with the intention of breaking that promise once the unsuspecting enemy is exposed (such as by coming out of cover to attack the enemy coming to take the ""surrendering"" prisoners into custody). Perfidy constitutes a breach of the laws of war and so is a war crime, as it degrades the protections and mutual restraints developed in the interest of all parties, combatants and civilians.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy)

.

Specifically, a violation of [*Article 37(1) of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions*](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/470-750046?OpenDocument):

> It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy:

> ***(a) the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender;***

The most direct relationship here to answer this is probably the first instance of the embargoes by Clinton, but I'm going to add some more history after that.

Under Clinton in 1995, [there was a total embargo issued against Iran by American countries](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/01/world/clinton-to-order-a-trade-embargo-against-teheran.html) 

*""President Clinton said yesterday that he would cut off all United States trade and investment with Iran, including purchases by American companies that account for more than 20 percent of that country's oil exports, in a further effort to isolate it as an ""inspiration and paymaster to terrorists"".""*

The biggest issue here being not buying Iranian Oil, which [their economy is heavily dependant on](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/iran/overview)

In 1996 The US Congress passed the [Iran and Lybia Sanctions Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/3107) which imposed economic sanctions on firms doing business in Iran and investing in Iranian energy. This was [widely disputed by companies in the UK and the EU.](https://www.stetson.edu/law/lawreview/media/u-s-secondary-sanctions-the-u-k-and-e-u-response.pdf)

In 1998 a new President was elected, Mohammad Khatami who called for a [""dialogue of civilizations"" with the US](http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9801/07/iran/interview.html) American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright responded positively and the US and Iran exchanged wrestling teams. 

*""In fact in 1998, wrestlers were the very first U.S. athletic team that travelled to Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, a development so important that they were invited to the White House by then President Bill Clinton when they returned. Since then, the United States and Iran have exchanged wrestling teams 32 times, making the sport a mainstay of people-to-people diplomacy even when the two governments were at an impasse over Iran’s nuclear activities.""*^[1](https://time.com/4674646/usa-iran-wrestling/) this then led to an ease of restrictions on travel to Iran and opening up markets for Iranian carpets and pistachios. 

These talks broke down from Iranian hard-liners and Iran not accepting preconditions for the talks including changes in Iranian policy on Israel, nuclear energy, and support for terrorism. (Keddie, Modern Iran, (2003) p. 272)

There were also talks in September of 2000 between [US Congresspeople and Iran's Meiji (Parliament)](https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230730/http://www.american-iranian.org/aicinthenews/For%20Iran%27s%20Visiting.pdf)

After the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, there were expression of sympathy to the US and Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, ""suspended the usual ""Death to America"" chants at Friday prayers"" temporarily. Iran also helped the US overthrow the Taliban regime as the Taliban also [had friction with the Iranian regime](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/a-failure-to-communicate-100052)

Then there was the Axis of Evil speech by US President George Bush which stated among other things that [""Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.""](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/sou012902.htm)

In 2003 there was the ""Grand Proposal"": *""The most crucial documents are the Iranian proposals for a “grand bargain” with the U.S. Iran apparently was partly reassured by the bustle of diplomacy in 2001-2003, while also nervous at what it saw as U.S. swagger into Iraq and Afghanistan – and taken aback by President Bush’s hostility to Tehran, as reflected in Iran’s selection for the “axis of evil.”..These proposals were an outgrowth of a burst of diplomacy, both official and unofficial, in the fall of 2001 as the U.S. and Iran cooperated against their mutual enemy, the Taliban. For background, here is a partial chronology prepared by Hooshang Amirahmadi, head of the American Iranian Council.""*

The process was killed in the US *""When the Neo-cons killed the incipient peace process, they did so partly on the basis that Iran had been uncooperative on terrorism. At a meeting in Geneva on terrorism issues, Zalmay Khalilzad had told Ambassador Zarif that the U.S. had information of a forthcoming terror bombing in the Gulf area. Mr. Khalilzad reportedly asked Iran to interrogate Al Qaeda members in Iranian prisons for information about the incident. Iran apparently dropped the ball (it says it didn’t have enough information) and did not generate any useful intelligence, and the incident turned out to be a suicide truck bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 12, 2003.""* [Source for last 2 quotes](https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/irans-proposal-for-a-grand-bargain/)

In August 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took over as Iran's President, he sent a personal letter to George Bush in the letter *""In his letter to President Bush, Iran's President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, declared that Western-style democracy had failed and that the use of secret prisons in Europe and aspects of the war in Iraq could not be reconciled with Mr. Bush's Christian values. But the letter did not address directly the central issue that divides the two countries: Iran's nuclear ambitions.*

*In his wide-ranging letter, written in Persian with an English translation, Mr. Ahmadinejad at times challenges and concedes as he directs question after question to Mr. Bush but offers no concrete proposals. In Iran today, the Iranian president portrayed it as a blueprint of ""suggestions for resolving the many problems facing humanity,"" the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.""*[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/world/middleeast/09cnd-iran.html) 

There is a lot of history here that soured this relationship and the next attempt came in 2013 when Iran's [President Hassan Rouhani spoke at the UN General Assembly in NYC.](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/world/middleeast/irans-new-president-in-first-un-appearance-preaches-tolerance-says-his-country-is-no-threat.html)

*""Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, preached tolerance and understanding on Tuesday, decried as a form of violence the Western sanctions imposed on his country and said nuclear weapons had no place in its future.*

*Mr. Rouhani, whose speech followed President Obama’s by more than six hours, also acknowledged Mr. Obama’s outreach to Iran aimed at resolving more than three decades of estrangement and recrimination, and expressed hope that “we can arrive at a framework to manage our differences.”*

*But the Iranian leader also asserted that the “shortsighted interests of warmongering pressure groups” in the United States had resulted in an inconsistent American message on the nuclear dispute and other issues.*

*Mr. Rouhani restated Iran’s insistence that it would never pursue nuclear weapons in its uranium enrichment program, saying, “this will always be the position of Iran.”*

The Obama administration acknowledged the role of the CIA in ousting Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, Rouhani refused requests to meet with Obama. There was another attempt at talks in 2017, and then the JCPOA in 2015.

After that, the Trump administration has done little to nothing to improve relations with Tehran. They demand a new deal that covers everything the nuclear deal did and a lot, lot more. From my viewpoint, that's ridiculous. Trump pulled out of a deal without Iran having violated it and against the will of our European allies. Then, implemented strong sanctions and ratcheted up the aggressive rhetoric. In response, Tehran looked to maintain the nuclear deal with everyone else involved and continued to comply with it for a while.

,"I'm primarily going to speak to section 3, however I will state that the full involvement of Soleimani in any actions against the US are unlikely to be ~~unknown~~ known to the public, as national defence and intelligence capabilities are usually classified.

As for section 3, AFAIK the only restriction to killing individuals outside of a military conflict are executive orders. There have been 3, first signed by Ford, then Carter, and finally [EO12333](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12333), signed by Regan. 12333 supercedes both of the other EOs and it's passage pertaining to assassinations is as follows:
""No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.""

Though what exactly is classified as an assassination can be debated [some definitions](https://apnews.com/1f914021bc802931059746a5ce8a192e) include targets for a military purpose, so a strong case can be made for this killing to be called an assassination.

This is further complicated however by the [recent classification](https://www.state.gov/designation-of-the-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps/) of the IRGC as a terrorist organization by the US State Department. Combine this classification with looser US standard on attacking and [killing people associated with terrorist organizations](https://web.archive.org/web/20090723021908/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A63203-2001Oct27?language=printer) and legally this killing probably stands up to US standards.

This is not a fool proof case however, as Soleimani was an appointed official of a recognized state whom we are not at war with, and as such the IRGC classification as a terrorist organization may be in shaky ground.

Edit: a word.

Edit 2: As was pointed out by /u/MiamiDouchebag (and something I should have mentioned in my original post) EOs have very little standing on the actions of the president other than by setting precedent as executive orders can be [revoked or modified](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/what-is-an-executive-order-/) at any time by the sitting president. The situation laid out above in my original post, is discussing the arguments that would be used for a political remedy of the situation, as it is unlikely if not illegal or unconstitutional for a legal remedy of such a situation to arise given [current policies](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-indictment-explainer-idUSKCN1QF1D3) within the executive branch of the US government.",Naiab,,ejs1f3,fd4ckb2
,"- What is the recent history of escalation in the conflict between Iran and the US leading up to this attack? And what was Soleimani's involvement in actions against the US and its allies?

The short answer is that Soleimani was a general of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp and, within it, the Qud force. [Edit: the relevance here is that the US Department of Defense, in their [statement](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/) and previously, characterizes the Quds as a Foreign Terrorist Organization]. He was also a strategic coordinator between Iranian proxies, often supporting Iraqi Shiite militias (now PMFs) and, more important, terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. An [example contribution](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander) would be his squelching of protests in Syria and then, subsequently, training their paramilitary police on dealing with similar behavior.

The Trump Administration alleges that Soleimani was responsible, directly or through coordination, for a series of attacks against US personnel in [December](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/world/middleeast/us-airstrikes-iran-iraq-syria.html), including the death of one contractor. According to the White House and its surrogates, and in addition to some [NYT reporting](https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/1213421769777909761), it appears that the primary justification is that Soleimani was planning an another imminent attack on US personnel.

- Are there similar cases in the past of the US killing foreign military leaders, or of other countries killing US military leaders, outside of wartime? What were the circumstances and consequences?

This is the weak spot in my answer, so I'll defer to others on it. In my lifetime, the most obvious example is the killing of Osama Bin Laden, but there have surely been other times in US history where the country has deigned to kill strategic targets even if I cannot recall them specifically. I think the key question is what you hone in on #3: what was the legal landscape of those actions at the time?

There is a distinction between authorized killings and unlawful killings, the latter of which, as mentioned below, is prohibited via Executive Order.

- What US law allows the killing of military officials belonging to a state with which the US is not formally at war? Does this violate any international treaties to which the US is a party? Likewise, can Iran legally kill American military leaders?

Usually we start with Article II, which addresses presidential power, and then, the War Powers Resolution, which provides contours to the President's authority to initiate hostilities. It does *not* provide blanket authority for the president to act militarily. It allows him or her to consult with Congress during a 48 hour window and, among other requirements, demands attempts to deescalate before acting. This is true even under the current Justice Department's interpretation of the WPR. No consultation occurred and we have no evidence of deescalation - though that might change as more information is revealed - and it is more likely that the Administration will rely on the AUMF.

We have three other vectors: the Authorized Use of Military Force (AUMF statute), of which there are two versions; the Constitution, and; international law (under which I will include treaties even though there is a distinction between normative international law and treaties blessed by Congress.) Please note that this is an overview and I am simplifying in some respects, and welcome people adding details in responding comments.

The AUMF allows the president to take unilateral military action under two justifications: (1) harboring Al Qaeda (2001 statute), and; (2) to further democracy in Iraq (2002 statute). Again, these are simplifications, but they represent, largely, the ambit of the two AUMF statutes that could potentially apply here.

Regarding (1), it's more likely that, given Iran and, specifically, Soleimani's coordination with proxy groups, the authority to strike in Iran is predicated on the notion that Iran has given material support - or at least *harbored*, Al Qaeda. That said, under (2), previous administrations have justified action in Syria and past behavior in Iran under the umbrella of state actors (or state ratification) supporting, aiding, etc. militia and other proxy forces that [destabilize Iraq](https://www.lawfareblog.com/did-president-have-domestic-legal-authority-kill-qassem-soleimani):

>As the acting general counsel for the Defense Department described in 2017 remarks, the 2002 AUMF “has always been understood to authorize the use of force for the related dual purposes of helping to establish a stable, democratic Iraq and of responding, including through the use of force, to terrorist threats emanating from Iraq.” In theory, Soleimani and the other targets of the Jan. 3 strike could qualify as either, due to the Iran-backed PMFs’ history of undermining the rule of law in Iraq and engaging in acts of terrorism targeting U.S. personnel. Moreover, just as the 2002 AUMF authorizes the use of force in Syria where doing so furthers its purpose, it might also authorize the use of military force in other neighboring countries, like Iran.

As the blog notes later on, the Trump Administration has also made a ""collective defense"" arguments, which functions as almost a thematic merger between the AUMFs, allowing more or less blanket authority for the executive to act unilaterally across these geographies purportedly threatening Iraqi democracy and/or harboring Al Qaeda.

There are two wrinkles that should be noted here: the first is that, according to *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld*, these unilateral military actions need to be justifiable under international law, and; the strike occurred in Iraq, not Iran. Thus, we have the question of whether the action is justified against an Iranian general even though he was physically located in a country outside of Iran, and without the permission of that country, both under the statutes and under international law. I am not an international law expert, so I will note it and stop here.

The Iraqi Prime Minister has stated (according to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/hxhassan/status/1213830321478737921) by Atlantic/Guardian reporter Hassan Hassan and this [tweet](https://twitter.com/janearraf/status/1213823941321592834) by NPR reporter Jane Arraf) that Donald Trump called him and asked him to mediate with Iran's Soleimani, in a larger response by the PM calling for US troops to leave Iraq.

If this is true, there is no way to argue that the US acted in good faith. It means that Soleimani entered Iraq to mediate peace based on direct requests from Trump, and the US used this to track his position in Iraq and kill him.

The damage this does to US credibility is hard to overstate.  If the US openly kills those that think they are heading to a neutral site for peace talks, no group in the Middle East will want to try and reduce tensions with US. 

Whether or not this was an assassination is largely meaningless, as the act is only illegal through executive order.  It may or may not be a war crime or crime against peace, but this also means very little in terms of consequences. 

The consequences to the US would involve the damage to our standing with our allies, an inability to enact even basic diplomacy in the Middle East, and the possibility of further escalation.  

Trump is largely immune to consequences in the US.  As President, he can commit whatever war crimes he desires with impunity without the possibility of indictment, and the US's power largely protects him from retribution in international courts. He can only fail to be reelected or be impeached by the House and indicted by the Senate.  The Democrat controlled House may seek further impeachment articles, but the Republican controlled Senate has shown no signs of breaking away from Trump. Instead, the GOP has praised this killing: [[1](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mcconnell-lauds-iranian-generals-killing-schumer-decries-lack/story?id=68052592)], [[2](https://hotair.com/archives/karen-townsend/2020/01/05/cruz-trolls-democrats-senate-resolution-praising-soleimani-mission/)], [[3](http://okcfox.com/news/local/sen-lankford-releases-statement-on-death-of-iranian-general-soleimani)]).",ManBearScientist,,ejs1f3,fdbtwfd

,"The study found that it was the third consecutive year that emissions in the United States had declined, ""though the fall was the smallest over the last three years.""

In other words, emissions declined under Trump, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the late Obama era. (The BP study was released on the same day as Bloomberg published the EPA statement, so it’s not clear that the agency could have known about it when it made its statement.)

A second set of data from the Energy Information Administration, a data-collecting unit of the federal Energy Department, showed a similar pattern.
The EIA data covers 2017 and the first two months of 2018. However, it totals only the emissions from the energy sector, which is a significant source of emissions, but not the only one.
Like the BP report, EIA found that that carbon emissions from energy declined between 2016 and 2017.
But the annual decline slowed on Trump’s watch in the EIA data, too. In 2017, when Trump was president, emissions fell by less than 1 percent. That was a smaller decrease than for either of Obama’s final two years. In 2016, emissions fell by 1.64 percent from their 2015 level, and for 2015, they fell by 2.68 percent over their 2014 level.

In addition, the EIA estimated that emissions will actually rise over the next two years. In 2018, the agency forecasts a 1.1 percent increase, and in 2019, it projects a 0.2 percent increase

,"The 21 and up for drinking laws comes from the Supreme Court Case [South Dakota v. Dole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_v._Dole). In that case, Congress withheld a small portion (5%) of highway funds from states who didn't set their drinking age to 21. The State sued. Congress argued that this was allowed pursuant to its spending power, where Congress gets to decide how much money is spent and on what it is spent (US. Const. Art. 1, § 8). The court sided with Congress, and the key was that withholding only 5% wasn't overly coercive. So, Congress is allowed to coerce (or perhaps ""incentivize"" is a better word) states to follow Federal policy.

This is only necessary because there are some things that Congress cannot legislate around and States can. Drinking age, like in Dole, was up to the states to decide piecemeal. Congress used the carrot of highway funding to encourage states to go along with Federal policy that Congress has no other way to compel. It is also important that South Dakota had a choice - they could have conceivably decided to keep their lower drinking age and opt out of the 5% of highway spending. It didn't rise to the level of losing ALL their funding if they didn't concede the point. I think this is important for the withholding of money from law enforcement in the second part.

As for the withholding funding from law enforcement for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities, to me it appears to be an anti-commandeering decision. There is a fundamental separation of powers outlined between Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the United States Constitution ([link for reference](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript)). The Executive can do things that the Judiciary and Legislature cannot, as well as the other way around for each branch. The nature of our federal system also has a separation of powers between the centralized Federal government and the governments of the many States. Anything not outlined within Article 1, which lists the powers of Congress, is beyond Congressional power to legislate and is therefore left up to the states (see US. Const. Amendment 10). This, again, is why Congress had to use its spending power to try to entice states to follow its chosen policy: it had no direct power to legislate over the question.

In [Printz v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printz_v._United_States), the Federal Government was attempting to require local officials to enforce federal laws. The Supreme Court said this was a violation of the 10th amendment, and the case exemplifies that anti-commandeering principle. Essentially, the issue is one of federalism. A citizen is subject to both the Federal Government and their State government. Each government has their own domains of power with some overlap. I, as a citizen of my State, have to follow my state's laws on gambling, driving, voting, etc. I, as a citizen of the United States, have to follow the federal government's laws on marriage, registering for the draft, drug laws, etc. I have these two bodies who get to make rules that I must follow, but neither of those two entities have to make me follow the other's rules. That was the ruling in Printz, that the Federal government can pass laws that private citizens must follow, but it cannot force State officials to be the enforcement mechanism of those laws.

In the immigration context here, it seems that the withholding of all the funds would be overly coercive and that local law enforcement officials would be commandeered and required to enforce Federal law.

EDIT: as u/huadpe noted below, the ruling of the court in the Immigration case out of California didn't pack a Constitutional wallop. The Court made its determination based on a lack of Congressional authorization:

>While the legal principles stated in the grandparent comment are correct, they weren't the reasons applied in this case. In this case [the Third Circuit ruled](https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/182648p.pdf) that there was no law passed by Congress that authorized these particular conditions.  
>  
>In doing so, the court avoided making a big constitutional ruling, and just ruled on the grounds of statute, and the constitutional principle that the executive branch can't do things not authorized by statute in the context of Federal spending, since Congress is the ultimate source of power over Federal spending.

The discussion above on Printz may be accurate and informative, but it is not a direct answer to the question presented. I'll leave it for posterity, but see the u/huadpe's comment and link for a correct answer.",jstncrwfrd,,ej9qh9,fcx8tr8
,"The main difference in those cases is _which part_ of the Federal government was doing the withholding.

In the case of the drinking age, the condition was clearly imposed by Congress as part of its legislative power over spending.  [The law was super specific that the money was conditioned on a drinking age of 21.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/23/158)

In contrast, the sanctuary cities policy was made up by the President and Attorney General, and _not_ specifically laid out in an Act of Congress.  The [third circuit ruling on it](https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/182648p.pdf) is explicit that that's the difference.  Congress, and only Congress, has the power to put conditions on Federal grants.

,"These comments are incomplete. The real place you need to look is to SCOTUS decisions. South Dakota v Dole and NFIB v Sebelius are controlling opinions in this area. Basically the federal government has a bit of coercion power over States. However the spending that is limited/withheld must be substantially related to the action they are trying to control. Basically, you can’t withhold education funding to get states to ban jwalking, but you can probably entice States to ban drunk driving by withholding highway funds (SD V dole).

,"This is pasted from my previous comments: As someone who has studied the Korean peninsula for over thirty years as a Korean linguist, intelligence analyst, and now, HS history teacher, it is clear that an agreement without clear details is unprecedented and historic in a very concerning way.

The full text of the agreement: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/full-text-of-the-trump-kim-summit-agreement.html

This is long on ideals yet completely lacks any plan of how or when anyone has committed to fulfill promises or how anyone will verify compliance.

What has been publicly released is contrary to Mike Pompeo's insistence that whatever came out of negotiations would be Complete, Verifiable, Irreversible. The parties promise to 'join efforts' [for peace], 'work toward denuclearization' and recover POW/MIA remains and no more. The agreement lays out no plan on how any of this will be accomplished.

There has been a long road of negotiation toward denuclearization and it has been marked by serious plans, aid, and agreements that allow some verification. Despite these long term efforts, denuclearization has not happened. Trump’s agreement does not change or address any of this.

Examples of past negotiations: (An abbreviated but extensive chronology is available here: https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron)

1985 NK signs nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Then later suggests it will only adhere to treaty only if US withdraws nukes from SK.

1991: President Bush withdraws all nuclear weapons from overseas including on the Korean Peninsula.

92: SK/NK sign denuclearization pact. Then US imposes sanctions for continued NK missile proliferation. IAEA inspections begin.

93: Reasonable suspicion of continued atomic development declared by IAEA. NK threatens to withdraw from nonproliferation treaty (NPT), then changes it's mind.

94: US Intel believes that NK has succeeded in producing nuclear weapons.
This pattern of negotiate, agree, renege, attempt to renegotiate, develop weapons, test weapons continues right up to today. Deals are made, and broken. https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron

As a gesture of goodwill before this negotiation, NK 'gave up' a nuclear test site that was already unusable. There is no reason to believe that this is anything but business as usual, and we've already granted NK a free political victory by the way negotiations were handled this time.

A couple of longterm goals of NK were met and granted in this meeting without really giving anything up:
Prestige and Legitimacy: a one on one meeting with the president of the U.S.
Commitment to end joint exercises with an ally.
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html
 
We pretty much handed NK and Russia what they wanted from the beginning and Trump already admitted this idea including stoppage of joint US/SK exercises came from Putin.

As one Reuters article was titled today ""Historic Trump-Kim Summit Ends with Promise; Light on Substance"" It is easy to get agreement on broad principles. This has happened time and again. What makes it historic is that 
1. up to this point we haven't ever given NK a direct meeting with a sitting president which is something they really want, but does not speak to substance for us.
and 2. POTUS agreed to drop joint SK/US exercises. That is specific and verifiable, where work toward denuclearization is non specific and not easily measurable. Exercises with SK are an important part of American military presence in the region and while they are anything but perfect (I've participated in a few.) they do keep the forces able to communicate and work together while reassuring our allies. Basically we agreed to significantly curtail a working relationship with an ally to get a vague promise from an historical adversary. Strangely it appears to be a work out the details later negotiation.

Details and compliance are where things have broken down in the past. There is no public indication that these issues have been addressed. That’s not surprising. 

Business as usual with some significant concessions to the NK regime. Trump may legitimately not see his promises as concessions if they are things he wants anyway, but he and I don't see eye to eye so there's that.
Yes Views vary: Note the difference between R and D senator comments: https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/congress-republicans-reaction-north-korea/index.html (R isn't all yeah this is great though.)

What do Koreans think? That's mixed as well. ""On the other hand, some said that while they admit the efforts made by President Trump have contributed to the realization of the extraordinary summit, they fear that Kim and Trump are figures who are “hard to predict.”



On the idea that Kim Jong Un is somehow different from his father and grandfather: Different leader, same family, similar goals. There has been indication of dissent in the privileged class since he took office. His response has been purges, public executions, and private murders overseas. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/asia/north-korea-human-rights.html

Overall his methods have been similar to his father and grandfather's: Control media and other speech, control travel, control the economy, feed the army, use brinksmanship and invective as diplomacy tools, build up nuclear and strategic weapons capability (because not being able feed your people makes conventional warfare difficult and nukes make good deterrents/negotiating pieces and don't have to be fed).
 
He appears to want what he has always wanted. Stay in power. Look good. International recognition/attention--particularly from the US. Cessation of US/SK military cooperation. US troops out of the peninsula. US/SK less closely aligned.

He made progress on many of those goals without having to give anything concrete yet. That's a win for him from his perspective. I don't yet see any evidence that he is really departing from methods from the past--rather he appears to be continuing them.

If the details really are worked out later and adhered to over time, then we have a change that might require standing against hardliners, but his usual method is just to kill those who disagree.

Long term (no source for this) rapprochement with China to bring real pressure to bear on NK will break the log jam, but China does not want the Koreas to unify possibly putting a US ally on its border so close to Beijing, and possibly a flood of refugees if North Korea fails as a state, but the US currently in a trade war with China is unlikely to bring this up soon given the Human rights concern over the Uighurs imprisoned out in western China.

,"Although I haven't been following closely recent developments, I've worked in counterproliferation specific to NK in another life.

First and foremost, my understanding is that there hasn't been a single nation that has relinquished nukes once they possessed them, so IMHO there's little to no reason to think that NK will do so.  [WMDs are asymmetric weapons](https://www.britannica.com/topic/asymmetrical-warfare) first and foremost (not considering whatever may constitute a moral dimension), meaning that they pose a very large cost-effective deterrent against would-be aggressors.  Considering that [NK believes that the US poses an existential threat to their existence](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/north-korea-the-problem-that-wont-go-away/), they will likely cling to nukes as if it was the only thing that matters to them (because [they definitely don't care about the welfare of their own populace\).](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/north-korea)

Second, counterproliferation works best when the nation doesn't have nukes yet (see [Iran](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-breaching-limits-uranium-enrichment-there-s-still-time-diplomacy-n) or [SK](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/07/31/why-doesnt-south-korea-have-nuclear-weapons-for-a-time-it-pursued-them/) when they were/are mulling getting them).  Once they have them, well...

Third, NK's main ally in all of this is not China but SK.  There is a lot of speculation surrounding when SK will be ready to execute a East/West Germany type scenario and unify the two countries, which is [one of the biggest issues in any election in SK.](https://www.ft.com/content/0fd71f12-bf10-11e9-89e2-41e555e96722)  IMHO, this is the only realistic way to solve this problem (to whatever extent it is a problem), to have the two countries unify and continue the SK policy of no nukes, dismantle whatever NK has and to continue the good relations SK has with both China and the US.  

Any US initiative to aggress upon NK will likely meet extreme SK resistance and will easily risk sundering our rather deep alliance with them.  IMHO it is not a political possibility, which is [generally seen as consensus in foreign policy circles.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/11/should-you-worry-about-a-u-s-war-with-north-korea-not-really/)  I know Trump is all about being unpredictable, but IMHO he's proven to be fairly reasonable when it comes to risking war (in that he's very cautious about doing so), and the costs of this particular, proposed conflict are astronomical given that both sides have nukes, and were astronomical already as [NK's threat of turning Seoul into a 'sea of fire' before they had nukes was credible](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/could-north-korea-annihilate-seoul-its-artillery-20345) (Seoul and the surrounding metro region have about half SK's population).

,"This is actually a common issue in legal cases; when does an order or edict or declaration become effective?

Very often, there are instances where a decision has been made, but further ministerial steps are needed to bring it into force.  For example, Federal appeals courts issue rulings, [but do not typically issue a ""mandate"" enforcing their rulings](https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/AppellateProcedureGuide/Decision___Post-Decision/APG-mandate.html) until some time after the ruling. 

It is accepted however that upon issuing the ruling, even without the mandate, the final decision has been made and one side has prevailed, and can e.g. take an appeal to the Supreme Court.  

A similar issue was at the center of [the most famous early Supreme Court case in US history, _Marbury v. Madison._](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison) In that case, President Jefferson refused to deliver the commissions for a number of federal judges appointed during the last days of the term of President Adams (and quickly confirmed by the Senate).  A part of what the Supreme Court was asked to rule on was whether they had been properly appointed before the delivery of their commissions.

In this case, the House has voted to approve articles of impeachment, but has not yet undertaken ministerial tasks of appointing impeachment managers to transmit the articles to the Senate.

If the delay is merely to allow the ministerial duties to be done then I would say Trump is impeached and should be treated as such.  (Arranging managers etc could take a bit of time, and Congress is [not meeting until the next Session begins in January](https://www.majorityleader.gov/calendar))

>If the House does not communicate its impeachment to the Senate, it hasn’t actually impeached the president. If the articles are not transmitted, Trump could legitimately say that he wasn’t truly impeached at all.

That’s because “impeachment” under the Constitution means the House sending its approved articles of to the Senate, with House managers standing up in the Senate and saying the president is impeached.

>Once the articles are sent, the Senate has a constitutional duty to hold a trial on the impeachment charges presented. Failure for the Senate to hold a trial after impeachment would deviate from the Constitution’s clear expectation.

>For the House to vote “to impeach” without ever sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial would also deviate from the constitutional protocol. It would mean that the president had not genuinely been impeached under the Constitution; and it would also deny the president the chance to defend himself in the Senate that the Constitution provides.

,"Well, I'll first point out a few things:

**First, not all democratic countries have a written constitution and a Supreme Court**, the UK's Constitution is mostly unwritten and [every Act of Parliament is considered of equal worth to a Constitution article](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/sovereignty/). Some countries like France have a [Constitutional Council](https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/en) rather than a Court, which means it is not at the top of the judicial hierarchy, it doesn't hear cases presented in front of it, it mainly revises the constitutionality of laws and bills submitted for review by elected representatives (legislators or president). Some countries don't allow courts to review Parliamentary laws, like the Netherlands.

**Second, not all countries have a clause in their constitution equivalent to the Establishment Clause**. In fact, many democratic countries have or had official State Churches, like [Sweden](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Church-of-Sweden). Almost all democratic countries today provide for freedom of religion and forbids laws that would treat citizens differently based on their religion, but not all countries have adopted a constitutional firewall between the State and the Church..

In Canada, the Constitution and the Charter are silent on the religious neutrality of the State. In fact, the [Canadian constitutional Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html) even starts with ""**Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God** and the rule of law"".

That being said, the Charter forbids discrimination based on religion (article 15) and recognizes freedom of religion (article 2). This has been used by the Supreme Court to impose religious neutrality on local and provincial governments in some instances, using an expansive definition of ""discrimination"" that says that any [disparate impact of a policy or law on a ""protected class"" is discriminatory](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/part-ii-%E2%80%93-interpretation-and-application/constructive-discrimination), without the need to prove discriminatory intent, and that people have a duty to accommodate the religious if at all possible.

This has been used notably to force a municipal council to stop reciting a prayer before its meetings, under the argument that giving time to a Christian prayer discriminated against agnostics and atheists, making them feel unwelcome. You can read the Supreme Court ruling here: [Mouvement laïque québécois v. Saguenay (City)](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/15288/index.do).

That ruling refers to a frequent judicial test called the [Oakes Test](http://ojen.ca/wp-content/uploads/In-Brief_Section-1-and-Oakes_0.pdf) which applies to all violations of the Charter to see if they can be justified:

*1- There must a pressing and substantial objective for the law or government action.*

*2- The means chosen to achieve the objective must be proportional to the burden on the rights of the claimant.*

*i. The objective must be rationally connected to the limit on the Charter right.*

*ii. The limit must minimally impair the Charter right.*

*iii. There should be an overall balance or proportionality between the benefits of the limit and its deleterious effects.*

You might notice that this ""test"" relies a lot on the subjective appreciation of judges of what qualifies as a ""pressing and substantial objective"" and about the importance of the benefits and the limits on the ""infringed"" right to establish the ""proportionality"" of both. If you hadn't, now you have.

So, to sum up, Canada has no constitutional guarantee of separation between Church and State. Preferential treatment given to a religion may be perceived as discriminatory towards citizens of other religious faiths according to the Charter, and if an individual of another faith sues the government and is judged by the courts to have grounds for his claim of being discriminated against, then the Oakes test is used to see if this policy or law is justifiable.

Unless of course the government uses the Notwithstanding Clause to ignore the opinion of the courts on the subject. A specific example of that is currently under way, with French-speaking Québec adopting [bill 21 banning the wearing of religious symbols by civil servants and trying to install laïcité as a principle of its provincial government](https://election.ctvnews.ca/experts-say-notwithstanding-clause-may-not-stop-feds-from-challenging-bill-21-1.4604637). The Québec government, knowing the Canadian courts were likely to both rule this is discriminatory towards certain religions and to reject it based on the Oakes test, decided to use the Notwithstanding Clause to prevent the courts from ruling on the constitutionality of the law based on the articles of the Charter including the one on freedom of religion and against discrimination based on religion. This action, though massively approved by Québec voters and echoing [France's 1905 law on laïcité](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_French_law_on_the_Separation_of_the_Churches_and_the_State), [provoked anger and outrage in the Canadian judicial community](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/canadian-bar-association-calls-on-quebec-to-drop-notwithstanding-clause-from-bill-21) and [in the political establishment of English-speaking provinces](https://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/ontario-mpps-condemn-quebecs-bill-21), many of whom are seeking ways to get the courts to invalidate the law despite the Notwithstanding Clause.

I hope that answers your question for Canada. Others will have to provide answers for other jurisdictions, I have given the best answer my limited knowledge on the matter can support.",kchoze,,ed28bk,fbhdn2y
,"Coming at you from England, we _[literally have an official state religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_the_United_Kingdom#Church_of_England)_ (Church of England). [Bishops and Arch Bishops in that church are still appointed by the Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appointment_of_Church_of_England_bishops) (from two options, following a convoluted candidate selection process by the church itself, but still...), and [bishops of that church still have a significant number of seats in the upper house of parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_Spiritual) (The House of Lords).

So it's fair to say that we very much _do not_ have anything much like the lemon test.

Strangely enough though, in comparison to the the technically constitutionally secular US, where public proclamations and demonstrations of religiosity (largely Christianity) are considered essential to achieving political success, here discussing or being publically demonstrative about religion is (at least for any politicians who aspire to any serious power or recognition) considered to be at best gauche and at worst complete political poison. As an example (although going back a few years now) ex Prime Minister Tony Blair only announced his ""conversion"" to Catholicism [after his departure from office](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/22/uk.religion1), having previously stated ""we don't do religion"" (__Edit:__ with a hat tip to the [comment from Freeloading\_Sponger](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/ed28bk/what_are_the_international_counterparts_to_the/fbhowzl?context=1) it turns out the comment was ""we don't do *God*"" and it was from Blair/Labour's ""spin doctor"" Alastair Campbell rather than Blair himself. I still think it stands as an illustrative example, though), despite his affiliations being pretty obvious to most the whole time.

(Edit: not to claim that religion still doesn't have major influence in every day politics (even before you involve the _literal bishops_ in the Lords). Things like rights for sexual and gender minorities, abortion rights, and others have been and remain contentious and to suggest that religion doesn't have at least some influence in such things would be silly).",GenericUname,,ed28bk,fbhaodk

The Senate’s first rule of impeachment procedures says that the Senate won’t do anything on the impeachment until the House sends its managers with the articles. 

All the Senate has to do is change the rules. They could do pretty much anything they want. Most likely, if this goes on very long, Mitch would change the rules to say the Articles have to be delivered by Managers within a certain period of time or they will be dismissed.

,"There is a [nearly identical question](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/42131/what-exactly-are-the-chief-justices-powers-and-roles-in-presiding-over-a-pres) on politics.stackexchange from about 6 months ago with a sourced answer that I will transcribe here, as this question has floated for 10 hours without activity (unusual).



[Chapter 1: The Senate's Impeachment Role](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm) :

>Impeachment is a very serious affair. This power of Congress is the ultimate weapon against officials of the federal government, and is a fundamental component of the constitutional system of “checks and balances.” In impeachment proceedings, the House of Representatives charges an official by approving, by majority vote, articles of impeachment. **A committee of representatives, called “managers,” acts as prosecutors before the Senate.** The Senate Chamber serves as the courtroom. **The Senate becomes jury** and judge, except **in the case of presidential impeachment trials when the chief justice of the United States presides**. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict, and the penalty for an impeached official is removal from office. In some cases, disqualification from holding future offices is also imposed. There is no appeal.

[Emphasis added to highlight the roles.]

Essentially, the Chief Justice becomes a trial court judge and will do all those things a trial court judge would do and with power subject to rules of the Senate. The rules appear quite similar to a common trial and are covered, below, in the *RULES OF PROCEDURE ....*

The following *PROCEDURE AND GUIDELINES ...* refer to the *Presiding Officer of the Senate*. The following clarifies who that person is during the impeachment trial.

[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presiding_Officer_of_the_United_States_Senate):

>When the Senate hears an impeachment trial of the President of the United States, by the procedure established in the Constitution, the Chief Justice is designated as the presiding officer.

[PROCEDURE AND GUIDELINES FOR IMPEACHMENT TRIALS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-99sdoc33/pdf/CDOC-99sdoc33.pdf):

**The Chief Justice as presiding officer.**

>IV. When the President of the United States or the Vice President of the United States, upon whom the powers and duties of the Office of President shall have devolved, shall be impeached, the Chief Justice of the United States shall preside; and in a case requiring the said Chief Justice to preside notice shall be given to him by the Presiding Officer of the Senate of the time and place fixed for the consideration of the articles of impeachment, as aforesaid, with a request to attend; and the said Chief Justice shall be administered the oath by the Presiding Officer of the Senate and shall preside over the Senate during the consideration of said articles and upon the trial of the person impeached therein.

**Under some circumstances the Senate may overrule the Chief Justice.**

>VII. The Presiding Officer of the Senate shall direct all necessary preparations in the Senate Chamber, and the Presiding Officer on the trial shall direct all the forms of proceedings while the Senate is sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment, and all forms during the trial not otherwise specially provided for. And the Presiding Officer on the trial may rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy of evidence and incidental questions, which ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, unless some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate; or he may at his option, in the first instance, submit any such question to a vote of the Members of the Senate. Upon all such questions the vote shall be taken in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate.

**The power of the Chief Justice during impeachment trial.**

>XVI. All motions, objections, requests, or applications whether relating to the procedure of the Senate or relating immediately to the trial (including questions with respect to admission of evidence or other questions arising during the trial) made by the parties or their counsel shall be addressed to the Presiding Officer only, and if he, or any Senator, shall require it, they shall be committed to writing, and read at the Secretary’s table.

**The right of defense to examine witnesses.**

>XVII. Witnesses shall be examined by one person on behalf of the party producing them, and then cross-examined by one person on the other side.

**Conclusion of the trial, final vote.**

>XXIII. An article of impeachment shall not be divisible for the purpose of voting thereon at any time during the trial. Once voting has commenced on an article of impeachment, voting shall be continued until voting has been completed on all articles of impeachment unless the Senate adjourns for a period not to exceed one day or adjourns sine die. On the final question whether the impeachment is sustained, the yeas and nays shall be taken on each article of impeachment separately; and if the impeachment shall not, upon any of the articles presented, be sustained by the votes of two-thirds of the Members present, a judgment of acquittal shall be entered; but if the person impeached shall be convicted upon any such article by the votes of two-thirds of the Members present, the Senate shall proceed to the consideration of such other matters as may be determined to be appropriate prior to pronouncing judgment. Upon pronouncing judgement, a certified copy of such judgment shall be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State. A motion to reconsider the vote by which any article of impeachment is sustained or rejected shall not be in order

As stated above: *There is no appeal.* Furthermore, the Presiding Officer of the Senate (in this case, the Chief Justice) cannot overrule the vote.

,"Per [Lawfare blog's write-up on a Senate Trial](https://www.lawfareblog.com/imagining-senate-trial-reading-senate-rules-impeachment-litigation): 

> Critically, and contrary to common mythology and parlance, the chief justice is not the “judge” in an impeachment trial. The Senate itself is both judge and trier of fact, and the chief justice serves as its presiding officer. The rules thus require the chief justice to direct “all forms of the proceedings” (Rule 7) and, in so doing, “to make and issue all orders, mandates, writs, and precepts authorized by the rules” (Rule 5).

> Importantly, the chief justice may rule on questions of evidence—including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy of evidence and incidental questions (Rule 7). But the chief justice does not have to play this role, and he is not the final word on matters when he does. Should he decide that he wants to rule on a particular question, his ruling stands as the judgment of the Senate (Rule 7) unless a senator seeks a vote on the question—“in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate.” Should the chief justice not want to rule on an evidentiary question, he can simply submit it to a vote in the first instance (Rule 7). Upon all these questions, the vote must be taken “in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate” (Rule 7).

> In other words, a huge amount in any Senate trial depends on two big variables: the attitudes and views of Chief Justice Roberts and, ultimately, which side controls 51 votes to either sustain or overrule his rulings or to rule on questions he declines to address. An important wrinkle here is that it takes 67 votes, not 51 votes, to change a rule—so one key question is whether a motion would require a waiver of an existing rule or whether it can reasonably be reconciled with the rules. If it requires a rule to be waived or dispensed with, the motion requires a supermajority. This issue came up during the Clinton impeachment trial, when a senator asked whether, under Rule 20, a simple majority of senators could vote to open the Senate doors during deliberations. Chief Justice Rehnquist ruled that, while the rule seemed ambiguous, such a motion would require a 67-vote majority to prevail given “consistent practice of the Senate for the last 130 years in impeachment trials.” Two senators subsequently introduced motions to open the doors of the Senate during deliberations, but they twice failed to muster 67 votes.




However, the Chief Justice will also likely inherit the tie-breaking vote previously delegated to the Vice-President:


> One interesting question here is whether the Democrats need to flip four Republicans to reach the magical threshold of 51 to prevail on motions or only three, leaving the Senate perfectly divided. The answer turns out to be complicated. The reason is Vice President Mike Pence. Art. 1, § 3 cl. 4 provides as a general matter that the vice president shall be the president of the Senate but shall have no vote “unless they be equally divided.” Normally, then, Democrats need 51 votes to prevent Mike Pence from breaking a tie in the Republicans’ favor. But in the situation of an impeachment trial of the president, the vice president is not the presiding officer because of his obvious conflict of interest. The Senate impeachment rules are silent on the question of whether the chief justice casts a tie-breaking vote, but during the Andrew Johnson impeachment, Chief Justice Salmon Chase did so twice. So the answer is probably that Roberts could break a tie—meaning that on a matter submitted to the Senate without an initial Roberts ruling, Democrats would need to flip three Republican senators if Roberts agrees with them or four if he does not. Likewise, if Roberts rules on a motion as an original matter, it would require 51 votes to overturn his ruling—meaning that Democrats would need four Republicans to flip to overturn a Roberts ruling, but only three to sustain one.",Artful_Dodger_42,,ebr0lq,fb7rhys
,"Specific follow-up: I've heard the notion floating around that, if 51 senators were to vote to call upon Bolton and Mulvaney (key witnesses who've thus far refused congress's subpoenas, plus possibly even Trump) to testify, that John Roberts could make a ruling that could compel them to testify. In essence, producing an outcome similar to what the supreme court could rule at the end of the path the democrats chose not to take by not challenging these refusals in court.

Is this or something similar within the Chief Justice's power?",kazoohero,,ebr0lq,fb8wqru
,"Anything is possible, especially in the world of politics. A second Independence Referendum can happen in one of three realistic ways. 

First, it can get permission from Westminster. However, like you pointed out, [Boris Johnson will almost unilaterly deny the request from the get go.](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-scottish-referendum-snp-nicola-sturgeon-1341296) So to this extent, a repeat of 2014's method of using an Order of Council seems highly improbable.

Second and third are almost interchangeable. The Scottish Parliament could organise a new referendum without permission from Westminster, such as the [Catalan Parliament did in 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/catalan-independence-referendum-not-legal-spanish-constitution-european-commission-juncker-spain-law-a7978386.html). The Scottish Parliament can also call for a debate for a bill that would set forth a second IndyRef. This would add more of a shade of democratic legitimacy. But because it would be a reserved power being debated by a devolve Parliament, it would be open to [legal scrunity and debate by anyone under Scots Law](https://theferret.scot/can-scotland-hold-second-referendum-without-westminsters-permission/)

The issue is, both are highly illegal as they don't fall under Reserved Matters - and even if a successful referendum is held, such as in Catalonia, there is zero chance that Westminster would legally recognise the referendum results. And for an independent state to be ""official"", it needs to be recognised by other nations. [This happened with Kosovo, when they tried to declare that they were separate to Serbia](https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/15-countries-and-counting-revoke-recognition-of-kosovo-serbia-says/), and even though most of the Western World does recognise them as legitimate, many more don't. This leaves Kosovo in an odd quasi-legal space where in places such as the UN it's only an [observer state](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2017/11/16/the-costs-of-not-being-recognized-as-a-country-the-case-of-kosovo/), and the[ EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Kosovo_to_the_European_Union), where it's stuck in a limbo of being vetoed as it tries to gain EU membership.

That last point is key, since one of they main things that the SNP want to do once they leave the UK is to rejoin the EU. Spain has said they would [veto any attempts to rejoin the EU if Scotland isn't legally recognised as leaving the UK.](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-scotland/spain-would-not-oppose-future-independent-scotland-rejoining-eu-minister-idUKKCN1NP25P)

There is also the chance for this to devolve into a Constitutional Crisis, like I mentioned before with Scots Law and the ability to challenge a referendum, and force the Court System to make a ruling. The chance of this case being picked up, nevermind being heard, depends on so many specifics and details as there are certain things that the UK Court system is largely not supposed to wade in on - [such as political decisions.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49810261). An IndyRef would either be rejected outright, and be called illegal, or would be heard.

This legal debate also stretches into the specific wording of a referendum, and the 1998 Scotland Act that would give the powers to hold one. [This article](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/second-referendum-scottish-independence) discusses some of the more general points of a 2nd IndyRef.

There is also the (highly unlikely) scenario of a[ Northern Ireland-esque guerrilla warfare fight for Independence](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/pics/pictures/gallery/troubles-guerrilla-war-ripped-northern-18761326). But the SNP have [said they will only use diplomatic means.](https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/14/nicola-sturgeon-welcomes-new-snp-mps-after-demanding-independence-referendum-11906444/). And because of the way that being part of an unbalanced union works, [a referendum isn't even legally binding.](https://fullfact.org/law/can-scotland-legally-hold-another-referendum/) and since it is a [reserved power (the Constitution)](https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/opinions/can-scotland-leave-uk-and-remain-eu), this means that it's ultimately up the Westminster and Boris Johnson to say whether or not they'll accept any sort of move away from the Union.",Totes_Police,,ead8dp,favm8md

It seems to be that the Nunes memo was factually correct in that there were issues with the FISA warrant process.

>proposal\] over the line"" in terms of establishing probable cause, and we concluded  
>  
>that the Steele reporting played a central and essential role in the decision to seek  
>  
>a FISA order.

However, the core argument made by people who wave around the Nunes memo is that it somehow proves the investigation was invalid, which Horowitz definitely does not say.

The investigation started because of an alert from a friendly foreign government, and while the Steele report was used when applying for warrants, it wasn't used in the initial decision to investigate.

>FBI received reporting from a Friendly Foreign Government (FFG) that, in a May 2016 meeting with the FFG, Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos ""suggested the Trump team had received some kind of a suggestion"" from Russia that it could assist in the election process with the anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to candidate Clinton and President Obama. Days later, on July 31, the FBI initiated the Crossfire Hurricane investigation that is the subject of our report.

* When getting a warrant, is it *usual* to present conflicting evidence from multiple sources, or just the sources that provide suspicion?

,"I’m going to go for a more general outline, that leads me to believe Nunes was more right than wrong (though he focused on the partisan portion of a specific investigation)

1.) Nunes interview back in 2018 on fisa abuse and unmasking. It was brought up during the Russia investigation. It was often labeled unfounded conspiracy, but was known to be true (links farther down) by IG conducting assessments.

2.) The FISA stuff breaks out into sections. The relevant one usually ends up being Section 702 which grabs communications involving U.S. citizens and is supposed to mask their personally identifying info if they are not the target of the warrant/surveillance effort :

3.) This is the big doc. It outlines everything wrong with the entire thing, how it’s been illegally used (through probably a combo of incompetence, maliciousness, or ignorance). It even highlights how the IC knew what they were doing was wrong, and they did it exponentially more times than they originally said they had. 

It also ref Judge Rosemary Collyer’s (fisc court presiding judge) opinion that the majority of fisa warrants brought before the disc court were not legal.

My personal take away of the doc:: 

 2011-present there is rampant unmasking going on in these data collections. They are regularly described as ‘statutorily and constitutionally deficient’ by the IG. Govt speak for yeah they violated the 4th amendment on some of these folks. 

 They have been auditing the process for years now to determine how many systems can access this data, and who has that access. They’ve also trying to audit exactly how unmasked data illegally ends up in 5 Eyes hands (FFG - friendly foreign government). We’re spying on our citizens, improperly unmasking their names, and then putting them in databases that 5 Eyes (UK, Aussie, etc) can view unmasked.

,"> There are all 650 seats up for grabs - that's a majority requirement of 326 seats.

That's not really the number you look for in the leading party for a majority though. The party Sinn Féin, an Irish nationalist party who stands (runs) in Northern Ireland only, abstains from taking their seats which lowers the 650 seat total a bit. Additionally, 4 seats are held by 1 speaker and 3 deputy speakers, which do not vote (and I'm not sure about the deputy speakers, but the speaker's race is usually uncontested and not counted in a party's election results). That lowers it by a further 2. Around 320 is generally the effective threshold.

Additionally, for US readers here, in Westminster style parliamentary systems one party can form a formal coalition or less formal confidence-and-supply agreement with other parties to bring the larger party effectively into majority. The only party even at question for doing so with the Conservatives is the conservative (small c) Democratic Unionist Party, who also only stand in Northern Ireland. 

[This is how the Conservatives in 2017 got a plurality of 317 seats,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election) and then formed a government (""government"" = Prime minister and their cabinet, or the executive branch) with the 10 DUP MPs (members of parliament) for a 327 total. Additionally, the 7 elected but abstentionist Sinn Féin MPs lowered the majority threshold down from 326 to (at most) 322. Add in the speakers and we're looking at (at most) 320.

,"Sorry I'm so late:

So, I work in higher education and instead of answering your question, want to focus on where the costs come from. Understand that universities, many of them, compete in a global context and vie for research dollars, so it’s incumbent upon the universities to plan strategically for the future. That said, my role is one of strategy and institutional research/planning, and my role uses strategy, operational mathematics and research to understand the heart of an issue and to build plans to intercede, which is why I feel pretty confident in my statements.

You can break the issues into three separate parts:

1. Salary
2. Infrastructure
3. Operations

**Salary:** Universities are heavily [unionized](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/06/push-graduate-student-unions-signals-deep-structural-shift-academia) with staff, faculty and administration all either having union coverage or a quasi-union representation. It has meant that your janitors, security and AV tech get paid a “living wage”. You have janitors working at the university for 20+ years earning fifty-five thousand dollars. You have administrative staff with benefits, three weeks of PTO and a salary that gives them the option to live in \[Big Urban Area\]. Salaries are used to lure senior staff and faculty – my role is well paid, but in the private sector I could earn $250-$300k while I’m paid comparably less (under 200k) but take better benefits. We used salary to recruit top-tier talent – students, parents and institutions, all want world-leading research. Well, those researchers *cost money*. You can’t compete against the entire world without incentivizing people. It’s why we have such a strong hand when recruiting Canadian or European faculty – their countries *don’t* pay well, and we can lure the world’s best. If you want to pay a living wage and want the world’s best faculty, then it’s going to cost you.

You have faculty members and staff who’ve been at the university for 40 years and command large salaries. On the one hand, people rail against business turfing people and generally not being socially conscious. On the other, we don’t want to pay for the implications of our ideals. We want businesses who care about employees, we just don’t want to pay for it. It’s a catch-22. Sure, I can fire Cathy who has been at the university for 39 years doing the same job in the registrar’s office. But, if that the kind of place you want it to be?

**Infrastructure:** Universities are composed of many, many buildings. We have old buildings, new buildings and everything in between. Many universities are facing the “heritage crisis” where the public wants us to preserve our buildings of historical import, but it costs us four or five times as much to refurbish them as building a new building (and let me get to that in a second). We need single occupancy toilets, physical accessibility and to meet numerous regulations and requirements placed on us by municipal, state and federal governments as well as funding agencies and donors.

Let’s suppose you want to build a new science building (a project I’m overseeing now). It needs to be environmentally friendly and it needs to be built with an eye for the future. How much cold storage are we going to need? How many labs? How many microbiology labs? What are the specifications? You can put a random building up for a couple of million, but when you dedicate that building to, say, science, it’s going to cost you – tens of millions of dollars. The power alone is 3-4 times what a standard building uses because of all of the equipment and experiments that need on-going heating/refrigeration/security, etc. As we move towards more STEM, we need more lab space, which isn’t easy to build. A future-ready science building with adequate space and amenities is going to cost you $20 - $80 million, and if its hospital adjacent, look to the higher end.

But, we want rooms of the future for all students! Digitizing classrooms for humanities, in-class technology, new software for faculty to create syllabi, new CRM/SIS systems, cloud storage, and a whole new e-learning digital suit? Those are millions of dollars to acquire and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, per year in license fees. That adds up. Infrastructure is a major problem. It needs to be fixed, maintained and built. We want buildings of the future. We want future-proof science complexes. We want “State of the Art” but we just don’t want to pay for the complications. We want a grand new sports and arts complex, but for the low, low price of $Idontwanttopayforit. We want our money invested wisely, but we can’t do that without the necessary infrastructure.

**Operations:** This is another complex issue. Universities need to heat buildings to certain specifications, have water for research, cleaning and potable water to drink. Power and water buildings for high-usage buildings, like engineering and science buildings can run in the millions per quarter - just for their buildings. We have thousands of students charging phones and computers and accessing fee-for-use services like e-journals. We need to pay people to clean multiple buildings, provide on-going security and to meet the requirements students demand. Having a campus clinic with an on-staff physician is a seven figure yearly proposition. Services for students with learning disability, with physical limitations or with psycho-social issues? All are seven figure per year operations. A student who needs accommodation doesn’t pay more in tuition than someone *who doesn’t* use those services. But, those services are costly. We need to hire trained, certified professionals along with people who have licenses in their respective area. A pap smear and a meeting with the psychologist may not incur a cost to you (per se) but it does to the university writ-large. What people are bristling at is paying of services for someone else. They want these services offered, but for the low, low price of $idontwantopayanymorekthnx. A student who needs a note taker – the note taker alone is probably costing us $35 dollars an hour^(1) (salary + benefit % + overhead + training). For instance, just to pay for our note takers for one semester, costs us around three quarters of a million dollars. There are fewer than a hundred and they cover over thirty thousand student. The whole program costs well in excess of a million dollars per year. It comes out to about $38/student/year. But, think about it: there are hundreds of services like that. They all cost a fortune. The fees libraries pay for academic journals alone is in the millions. We want those journals, right? Well, they cost a fortune!

So, universities are not soaking their students and getting rich. We don’t profit off of them in the way they think. It costs millions to run a university and any leftovers are reinvested in research and staff. The debate about means-tested or “free” higher education is specious because it ignores university economics entirely and the reasons *why* university is so expensive. If we did a deep-dive on that, I think people would be shocked to find out that many of the things they’ve long demanded of universities cost a fortune and that we could make university “cheaper” but people wouldn’t like what that really means, particularly when you understand that in a global context and understand the real difference between an American and most foreign universities.

&#x200B;

1. A note taker may not earn $35/hour but between their salary and what we pay in benefits to the central budget and union dues, it often means someone earning $17-$22/hour is costing us between $35 and $43/hour to actually employ. People forget that we're charged a standard benefit rate of between 9% and 18% based on their professional coding. So, what someone gets in their pay every two weeks and what we actually pay to employ them is vastly difference.",,,e76kq8,faambxe
,"One thing this doesnt cover is the cost increases and why they exist.  This gives a snapshot of college tuition increases over 30 years.  


https://www.marketwatch.com/graphics/college-debt-now-and-then/

What would happen with universal college?  It really depends on the form.  Would we end up like the UK or Germany with fewer going to college and the conditions being more spartan?  Would we end up with something that results in nearly everyone going to college and it being a pre-k-16 system?  Would the result be only the best and brightest who want to go to college?   Given a large number of factors involving the college industry from research grants, endowments, revenue sports, and donations, i think all is unlikely within the US system.  

What we have seen with ‘rich’ schools mostly led by the ivies is a move towards no loans or tuition for moderate family incomes (varying from 60k to around 150k). The result is you have an extremely high tuitions that continually increase with a minority of students actually paying that price.",moxiebaseball,,e76kq8,f9vuzaw
,"Because I don’t think anyone is really moved by the moral arguments for and against means testing, I’ll stick to the economics here. The central trade-off in means testing is that if you don’t, the budget takes a larger hit. If you do, you create a system of high implicit marginal tax rates near the means testing point. Here’s a simple example: suppose we offer a $100K voucher to all families that can be applied to tuition and rent. However, we don’t want the well-off (who don’t “need” it) to take advantage of it, so we phase the benefit out over the first $100K in income. Note that a $1 increase in income results in a $1 decrease in benefits, so there is really no net change in well-being. Accordingly, we are essentially taxing additional income at 100% in the phase-out region!

Of course, in practice benefits are not always phased out this aggressively. However, contributions to marginal tax rates can still be [significant.](http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/11-15-2012-MarginalTaxRates.pdf) The CBO notes that filers near 100% of the federal poverty line essentially face tax rates of nearly 100% due to the combined effects of transfer phase-outs (Figure 2). An additional means-tested benefit can only exacerbate this, thus I think it’s bad policy.",,,e76kq8,f9w0udm
,"**Cost:** It creates a paperwork burden for prospective students and their families, which may discourage them from taking advantage. [This has already been a problem for the existing FAFSA and Pell grant programs](https://money.com/money/5040663/financial-aid-fafsa-verification-poor-students/). Even among those who do jump through all the initial hoops to apply, one analysis identified a substantial phenomenon of ""verification melt"": students selected for additional eligibility screening may simply drop out of the program rather than scrounge up all the additional documents they need to stay in. And while some poor families may miss out on the program because they couldn't deal with the bureaucracy, the other side of the coin is that affluent families who invest the time and energy find [plenty of ways to conceal their assets and become eligible for need-based aid](https://www.cappex.com/articles/money/how-to-shelter-assets-on-the-fafsa), sometimes even [extreme ways](https://www.propublica.org/article/university-of-illinois-financial-aid-fafsa-parents-guardianship-children-students). So a system that's intended to test for wealth might end up testing for bookkeeping creativity instead.

**Cost:** That paperwork burden for applicants is also a paperwork burden for whoever has to review the applications. For the programs above, that burden is assigned to universities, and the first source above says university administrators spend an enormous amount of time verifying eligibility for these programs even though the verification results in few changes to anyone's financial aid.

**Cost:** Redundancy. If you want to make sure rich families aren't getting a free ride, the federal government already has [a 75,000-employee agency working to ensure financial fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service). We don't require people to verify their personal income before using every little government service like public schools or public parks  (imagine the extra bureacuracy if we did) because they've already paid different amounts for those things depending on their income.

**Benefit:** A subjective sense of justice. Some people are enthusiastic about measures to prevent free riders from abusing a government service even the prevention costs more money than it saves. For example, [several states drug-test welfare recipients and disqualify them if they test positive](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/should-we-drug-test-welfare-recipients/). Data suggest that in some cases the expensive drug tests cost more than the small payments that would have otherwise been given to the small proportion of drug users, so the outcome of the testing is a net financial loss for the state. But these systems continue; it's difficult to put a price on fairness.",Epistaxis,,e76kq8,f9w8oo6
,"One negative against universal education is that in order to qualify for that benefit, you have to have received a high enough quality education to be admitted to college. That deepens the divide of income inequality.

,"I think the best argument in favor of means testing benefits goes something like: We want efficient taxes as much as possible, even if those taxes are regressive, and then we can make the more-regressive tax up to the poor by giving them special aid in the form of means tested programs. Essentially should we have means tested taxes, means tested benefits, or both, or neither?

To explain more: We have two main ways that government can help the poor relative to the rich. It can give means-tested benefits or it can tax progressively. Our current system does both, but consider whether it should do one or the other fully, and that may help answer your question about colllege. .

Progressive taxation systems generally do not allow for the most economically efficient taxes (i.e. taxes where we don't actually want to disincentive the thing we are taxing). Income tax, for example, is our main tax and its progressive, but do we really want people working less? The income tax hurts productivity, but it is a nice way to get more money from people with higher incomes. Compare that with a carbon tax. A carbon tax would be very regressive, since poorer people tend to spend a higher percentage of their wealth on gas/heating. Yet we DO want to disincentize carbon, so it'd be a pretty nice tax to have.

,"I think you're taking that paragraph in isolation and thus out of context. The preceding paragraph offers that context.

[US Constitution Article 1 Section 3 states](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3-)

>The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

>Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

Disqualification is not separate from ~~impeachment~~ conviction, but is in addition to removal from office after having been convicted by two thirds vote and confers no other punishment but does not absolve the person from further prosecution for the actions for which they were impeached.

Edit: for clarity",tklite,,e6lunz,f9rvcp2
,"That would have to go to the Supreme Court, because the wording could be interpreted multiple ways and has never been done.

US law generally has punishments written as ""punishment A or punishment B, or both"" or ""punishment A and punishment B"" or ""punishment A or Punishment B"". So under the first way, you could be given either one, or both at the sentencing body's discretion. Under the second, the punishment would be both no matter what. Under the third, the sentencing body could choose one of the two, but not both.

Following the Crimes Act of 1790, written around the same time so the legal language would be the same, this is how punishments have been ascribed .

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes\_Act\_of\_1790#Crimes\_established](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_Act_of_1790#Crimes_established)

If they were meant to be able to be applied separately, they would have most likely been written as

>Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office or disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States, or both.

For example, Obstruction of Dissection in the Crimes Act of 1790 carried a penalty of 1 year imprisonment *and* $100 fine. You would get both every time.

Corruption of Judicial records carried a penalty of 7 years imprisonment *or* $5000 fine, *and* 39 stripes (lashings). You would be given lashings every time in conjunction with *either* prison *or* a fine.

The fact that the Constitution says it shall extend to removal *and* disqualification, without any qualifier that would give the discretion to dole out either on their own,  would be consistent with all other US law at the time where both were automatic, and could not be applied separately.

**EDIT:** Disqualification also could definitely not only need a simple majority. The Constitution is explicit that conviction needs a 2/3 of those voting in favor. You cannot extend a Judgement or Punishment to someone for something they were acquitted of. You would still need a conviction, and *then* the sentencing body would have discretion to apply the judgement as allowed.

So **at best** you would need 2/3 to convict, then another 2/3 to remove, or a simple majority to merely disqualify from future office. That's the only way this would be able to work *if* it were deemed possible to separate the two punishments.",earthwormjim91,,e6lunz,f9rsnup

* disqualification is an optional additional judgement AFTER removal

Wikipedia 

Neither executive privilege nor the oversight power of Congress is explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution. 

However, the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that executive privilege and congressional oversight each are a consequence of the doctrine of the separation of powers, derived from the supremacy of each branch in its own area of Constitutional activity. 

The Supreme Court confirmed the legitimacy of this doctrine in United States v. Nixon in the context of a subpoena emanating from the judiciary, instead of emanating from Congress.

**The Court held that there is a qualified privilege, which once invoked (by the executive branch), creates a presumption of privilege, and the party seeking the documents must then make a ""sufficient showing"" that the ""presidential material"" is ""essential to the justice of the case**",rethinkingat59,,e6lunz,f9uw3z9

,"Inspectors General have some specific statutory protections as well as some normative protections.

[By statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05a/usc_sec_05a_01000003----000-.html) IGs report to the agency head (in this case, the Attorney General) for day-to-day supervision, but they can only be dismissed or transferred by the President, personally.  And the President must transmit to Congress a stated reason for the dismissal/transfer.

Normatively, while the AG can supervise the Inspector General, the IG has the ability to resign.  The AG can't insist he sign something he doesn't believe to be true, and attempting to do so is likely to result in the IG resigning and telling Congress and the public exactly why he resigned.  

Much more normally, the agency has the opportunity to issue a formal response to the IG report.  For example in [this recent report](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2019/e1905.pdf#page=1) attached as Appendix 6 is a memo from an Associate Deputy Attorney General responding to the findings of the report.  Likewise [this report has such a response at Appendix 4](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2019/g7019010.pdf#page=1) as does [this report.](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2019/g6019014.pdf#page=1)

The responses typically lay out whether the department or agency within the department agree with the findings and recommendations of the IG.  

So if Attorney General Barr wants to dispute a particular finding of the IG, he can author the DoJ response to the report which would be included in the final report.

,"I'm only one paragraph into the Minority Report and it's already apparent that it does not intend to address the facts of the matter at hand, only the impeachment process itself. Simply compare their opening paragraph of the Executive Statement to that of the Majority Report:

>On November 8, 2016, nearly 63 million Americans from around the country chose Donald J. Trump to be the 45th President of the United States. Now, less than a year before the next presidential election, 231 House Democrats in Washington, D.C., are trying to undo the will of the American people. As one Democrat admitted, the pursuit of this extreme course of action is because they want to stop President Trump’s re-election.  
>  
>Democrats in the House of Representatives have been working to impeach President Trump since his election. Democrats introduced four separate resolutions in 2017 and 2018 seeking to impeach President Trump. In January 2019, on their first day in power, House Democrats again introduced articles of impeachment.  That same day, a newly elected Congresswoman promised to an audience of her supporters, “we’re going to go in there and we’re going to impeach the \[expletive deleted\].” Her comments are not isolated. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called President Trump “an impostor” and said it is “dangerous” to allow American voters to evaluate his performance in 2020.

vs. 

>The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.  As described in this executive summary and the report thatfollows, President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign.  The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparentlyfeared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election.  To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditionedtwo official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.

To the heart of your question, it doesn't seem there are many ""disputed facts."" There is a lot of generous interpretation of cherry-picked exchanges, and a lot of attempts to muddy the waters of intent.

The Minority Report seems, instead, to be continuing its disjointed defense of breaking down the complex scheme into individual parts and saying ""didn't happen, and if it did then that's the President's right, and in fact the evidence (that we won't reproduce here, but it definitely exists and exonerates Trump) shows the opposite happened anyway."" For example, from page 27:

>B. The evidence does not establish that President Trump withheld a meeting with President Zelensky to pressure Ukraine to investigate the President’s political rival for the purpose of benefiting him in the 2020 election.  
>  
>Democrats allege that President Trump withheld a meeting with President Zelensky as a way of pressuring Ukraine to investigate President Trump’s political rival. Here, too, the evidence obtained during the impeachment inquiry does not support this allegation. President Trump and President Zelensky met without Ukraine ever investigating Vice Present Biden or his son, Hunter Biden.  
>  
>**The evidence strongly suggests, instead, that President Trump was reluctant to meet with President Zelensky for a different reason—Ukraine’s long history of pervasive corruption and uncertainty about whether President Zelensky would break from this history and live up to his anti-corruption campaign platform.** The Democrats’ witnesses described how President Trump has a deep-seated and genuine skepticism of Ukraine due to its corruption and that the President’s view was reasonable. Because of President Trump’s skepticism and because President Zelensky was a first-time candidate with relatively untested views, Ukraine and U.S. officials sought to convince President Trump that President Zelensky was the “real deal” on reform.

What evidence?! Trump's own words after he learned of the whistleblower report? Give us a break.

But oh wait, they literally assert ""Trump says it didn't happen"" is evidence against it happening (p21)... ignoring the times when he said it did happen and that he was in the right to do it.

They entirely dismiss basically all the evidence with a shrug and a ""get over it.""

>The evidence does not show that President Trump established a “shadow” foreign policy apparatus to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival. The President has broad Constitutional authority over U.S. foreign policy, and President Trump is likely suspicious of the national security apparatus due to continual leaks of sensitive information and the resistance within the federal bureaucracy. The three U.S. officials who Democrats accuse of conducting an “irregular” foreign policy channel had legitimate responsibilities for Ukraine policy. They kept the State Department and NSC aware of their actions. **To the extent Mayor Giuliani was involved, he was in communication with these officials and the Ukrainians did not see him as speaking on behalf of the President.**

That's funny, because [several State Department employees testified that President Trump told them that Rudy was speaking on behalf of the President.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/talk-to-rudy-testimony-from-diplomats-highlights-giulianis-central-role-in-driving-ukraine-policy/2019/11/06/a7ce7aea-0010-11ea-9777-5cd51c6fec6f_story.html)

The most egregious lie, of course, is in part III, alleging that Trump didn't obstruct Congress in its impeachment process. They don't say that he didn't obstruct it of course, only that he was entitled to because Democrats were being meanie-weenie poo-poo-heads:

>III.  The evidence does not establish that President Trump obstructed Congress in the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.  Democrats allege that President Trump has obstructed Congress by declining to participate in Speaker Pelosi’s impeachment inquiry.  
>  
>Under any fair assessment of the facts, however, President Trump has not obstructed Congress. In fact, the President personally urged at least one witness to cooperate with the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry and to testify truthfully. But Democrats cannot and should not impeach President Trump for declining to submit himself to an abusive and unfair process.

I'm a lot older than the average Redditor, and years ago I used to be a lawyer.  When I first started, the firm I was at would have us prepare 'moot cases' where all the baby lawyers were expected to argue a specific position in a given case and give a 15min debate presentation in front of the partners.  Frequently, about 3min, the partners would say, ""ok - stop here.  Now switch sides are argue the opposite side.""  On the fly, we were expected to stop immediately, flip and convincingly argue the counter point.  The lesson we learned was this: when presented with a case, step one is to litigate your argument, and step two is to *litigate the oppositions' case.*  If you can do this, it shows that you understand the totality of the case, not just part of it.

Here is a life pro tip: today I work on Wall St and do a lot of hiring.  For every interview, I have the candidate prepare a stock pitch (eg, prepare a 10 min presentation on why I should buy a stock).  Three minutes, in I stop them and say, ""ok - now spend 10min explaining why I should short it"" (eg, bet its going down, not up).  About half have a heart attack, about 30% fumble it and about 20% nail it.  That 20% is the only group that makes it to the next round bc they are the ones that *truly* get the story.  If you are job hunting (or in college and will be job hunting), you need to be at least somewhat skilled at this for a wide variety of jobs.

This is what I have done here - this comment below represents the 'opposition litigation' as summarized from the reporting of the Economist and the FT, as they (generally) are very good at presenting the various arguments and letting the readers decide.  This does not mean you have to agree with what I have presented, but it does mean you *should* be aware of it, and understand that some people will litigate the position I have laid down.  A number of people are *aghast* at what I've written, which is silly.  If you *really* understand something, you should be able to argue the opposition's side in the terms the opposition would use.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Original comment from this morning:  

If you want a 'real' neutral view of this topic, I'd suggest high-quality foreign media, such as The Economist and The Financial Times (these are my go-to; I'm sure there are others); American media is just too hopelessly biased to give you a fair view.

The whole argument around the Ukraine scandal and impeachment has very little to do with differences in the material facts.  This case has everything to do with *intent*. I'm lifting the summary below (mainly) from The Economist's ~~articles~~ podcasts over the last ~8 weeks: 

It is a core material fact that Hunter Biden was [being paid $600K/yr](https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/27/hunter-bidens-reported-burisma-payout-was-far-above-comparable-board-compensation/) to be on the company's board (note that this is over 2x what AAPL pays its board members) and his firm was paid upwards of $2M for consulting services of a very unclear nature.  It is also a core material fact that Hunter Biden had no relevant experience in the energy sector or the Ukraine, and has lived the life of a rich 'playboy' (for lack of a better term); [he was kicked out of the navy reserve for drug use](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/joe-bidens-son-hunter-kicked-out-navy-cocaine-n227811) and appears to have a taste for strippers.  Hunter Biden's only marketable asset is the fact that he is the son of Joe Biden.  Lastly, it is a core material fact that - as of right now - there is *ZERO* evidence that Joe Biden was influenced, in any way, by Hunter Biden.  However, we should be able to all agree, regardless of political sway, this optically looks really, really bad.  Maybe there's no fire, but that's an awful lot of smoke.  

Now comes the 'intent' part.  The executive branch has full and free reign to investigate corruption; some would argue that the executive branch is *obligated* to investigate corruption (we invaded the country of Panama to root out corruption.)  We can all also agree that Trump is *incredibly* unconventional in his approach to politics (I'm being generous here).  

If you support Trump, your opinion is as follows: Trump was obligated (or well within his rights) to investigate Hunter Biden and influence peddling, particularly when the ultimate subject *could* be the leading presidential candidate. Put differently, how could a sitting executive branch *not* investigate potential influence peddling at this level. The investigation, just like all things 'Trump' was extremely unconventional by traditional standards; however, that is not an impeachable offense.  In fact, many argue the nontraditional approach isn't a big deal at all - one of Trump's defining characteristics, which his supporters love him for, is his unconventional approach. Covering up the investigation - if you look at it the right way - limited the damage to Joe Biden's campaign, pending evidence of actual influence peddling (eg actual fire as opposed to smoke). The 'crime' here is Hunter Biden attempting to peddle influence - even if he was unsuccessful and Joe Biden was unswayed.  If Trump's campaign happens to benefit from rooting out this potential corruption, then that is just the way the political cards fall, but the whole thing was set in motion the nanosecond that Hunter Biden started taking money that he shouldn't have.   

Again, you may not personally agree with this, but this is the principle argument that the remaining Republicans with principles are arguing.  And if we are to be politically neutral, this position has a some merit.  If Don Trump Jr was found to be taking huge sums of money from a Russian controlled country, would the Dems just do nothing at all?

FWIW - the Economist has been predicting that the ultimate outcome here is a censure resolution by the House, bc the Senate is not going to vote to impeach.  Trump and his supporters will frame a failed impeachment vote in the Senate as a 'win' and 'vindication' heading into the 2020 election, and Pelosi is too smart to give a streetfighter like Trump a win like that.  If the House censures Trump, Pelosi doesn't need the Senate and Trump doesn't get the win - in fact he really doesn't get a response. Personally, I didn't agree with this at first, but I'm kinda coming around to the idea, if only due to the realpolitik involved in giving Trump a win.

Having said that, the below subjects are also up to factual dispute: 

**1) The purpose of President Trumps interaction with the Ukrainian President.** 

The [Majority's report](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20191203_-_full_report___hpsci_impeachment_inquiry_-_20191203.pdf) states a number of vague and pointless statements, albeit nefarious sounding, regarding the President's intent. 

>The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort **by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election. As described in this executive summary and the report thatfollows, President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign.** The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditionedtwo official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.

Entirely disregarding the President's stated purpose of investigating Joe Biden and his Son's actions in the Ukraine in an apparent attempt to get attention off him attempting to investigate illegal actions of the Bidens and onto ""the attempt"" to investigate. Actions of which [Joe Biden admitted to on video](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/09/27/flashback_2018_joe_biden_brags_at_cfr_meeting_about_withholding_aid_to_ukraine_to_force_firing_of_prosecutor.html). 

All while ignoring the extreme hypocrisy that accusing the president of ""attempting to influence the 2020 election"" is 1] not only implying that anyone in a political position to even ""potentially"" run for president is immune from investigation but 2] Exactly what their self-stated ""Political"" investigation of the president is doing Literally the same thing they are accusing the president of.  

**2) The accusation the President pressured the Ukrainian President to investigate or he'd withhold aid.** 

You know, that nefarious phrase suddenly used so constantly.

 Russian Collu.. I mean ""Quid Pro Quo"". Sounds scary huh? Well it literally just means ""something for something"". 

Well, the Ukrainian President [debunked those lies](https://time.com/5686305/zelensky-ukraine-denies-trump-pressure/) from the very beginning. 

>“I think you read everything. I think you read text,” Zelensky said to the gathered reporters on Wednesday. “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic, open elections of U.S.A. No, you heard that we had good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things. I think, and you read it, that nobody pushed me.”


But all in all, the public already knows what this is. **Another** act in political theatre. Bringing to mind all the past, similar events like ""Russian Collusion"", ""Kavanaugh"", ""Porn-stars"", out of context ""both sides"" quotes, ""taxes"", ""kids in cages"" and locker-room recordings.

""Ethnic  diversity  is  increasing  in  most  advanced  countries,  driven  mostly  by  sharp  increases  inimmigration.  In  the  long  run  immigration  and  diversity  are  likely  to  have  important  cultural,economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits. In the short run, however, immigration and ethnicdiversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital. New evidence from the US suggeststhat  in  ethnically  diverse  neighbourhoods  residents  of  all  races  tend  to  ‘hunker  down’.  Trust(even of one’s own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer. Inthe long run, however, successful immigrant societies have overcome such fragmentation bycreating new, cross-cutting forms of social solidarity and more encompassing identities. Illustra-tions of becoming comfortable with diversity are drawn from the US military, religious institu-tions, and earlier waves of American immigration.""

On the plus side you probably have an increase in productivity as the US skims off the top few % of minds from Africa and Asia. Note that the Putnam is generally in favor of immigration but the long term results he predicts are more speculative. You may have permanent economic and cultural rifts among ethnic lines as are present in Brazil. If I had to speculate I would think a balkanization if society among ethnic lines is highly likely in the near and medium term and maybe the long term. You saw something similar in the early 1900s between people from different European countries who were much more closely linked by religion and culture than the immigrants we have today.

The House or Senate could choose to keep a vote private, but it would still be recorded in the journal if more than 1/5 of members requested it.  In the event of such an important vote being kept secret, my guess is that it would leak.

Also even if it didn't leak, a future House or Senate could vote to release the journal record on the impeachment vote, and [it is widely accepted that one Congress could not bind a future Congress.](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1587&context=faculty_scholarship) So there's no way to ensure the vote remains secret in perpetuity.

,"1. It’s hard to argue that another nation is interfering by removing a special trade privilege granted to another country, or controlling their own trade towards that country. I imagine the argument is weak internationally (it would not be advantageous for *any* country, to have another country controlling what it can or cannot set trade laws on.)  
Each country has the right to not trade with, or trade less with, or impose tariffs upon other countries. That’s why it seems weak (to call it interference).  
More likely, China is calling the trade restrictions to be interference as it reveals support for the protesters. China likely considers any foreign opinion on Hong Kong to be irrelevant to China and Hong Kong, and thus publicly promoting such a law can be framed as interference.  
  
2. There’s not much I’ve seen to argue that the protests are the result of foreign interference. I have seen some arguments about how the protesters wave British or American flags, but it’s not clear how that proves that the US or UK/Britain are interfering to cause to protests, rather than just the protesters trying to appeal to western powers. There could be some argument about American entities donating to protester causes including [supplies and training,](https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/10/article/tracking-foreign-interference-in-hong-kong/) ~~but I have not found anything about official government interference in that regard.~~ There are some described efforts by the US National Endowment, which operates [soft-power mechanisms to promote political pluralism](https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/10/article/tracking-foreign-interference-in-hong-kong/). This is seen by some as a continuation of clandestine efforts by the CIA in the 50s, 60s, and 70s; but differs in that its funding is mostly public and mission is less about promoting America than about promoting political pluralism. (same source)  
  
3. I can’t really answer that. On one hand, certainly every major power wants some influence over every other major power. Certainly, there are foreign spies in every nation. But the power of those foreign assets - especially in the magnitude to disrupt a major power like China - is not well-explained. On the other hand, it is plausible for the complaint of foreign interference to simply be a propaganda tool to make people believe the protesters are not authentic, and to make it easier for people to dismiss them. Among other things.  
  
4. China has a [permanent spot on the UN Security Council](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/current-members), which comes packaged nicely with veto power. They can use that to push against other nation’s interests. They (currently) use the veto power rather sparingly, [almost never exerting a veto unless with Moscow.](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/opinion/why-beijing-votes-with-moscow.html) That’s one card.  
Trade is another. China has an [enormous economy](https://howmuch.net/articles/the-world-economy-2017) tied well enough into the world economy that they could, if they chose to, [disrupt it in major ways](https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=1784). Like any country, they can impose their own tariffs and trade laws.  
Another, perhaps less-likely response by China could be to restrict US Visas into China, or even further, detain or arrest American already in China. [See China's arrests of Canadian nationals](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2178515/theres-human-cost-these-political-situations-chinese-arrests), around the same time Canada and China were engaged in a row over the Canadian arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of the Chinese telecoms giant’s founder. Neither Canada nor China directly linked the arrest of the Canadians to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, but it is speculated that these back-to-back arrests are simply part of a tit-for-tat reprisal (same source).

,">What are, if any, some evidence that the protests are actually a result of foreign interferences?

While not directly pertinent to the specific issue of current HK affairs, 'foreign interference' has been a hallmark of China's interactions with the rest of the world, particularly the US:

1) [The CIA](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-15-mn-22993-story.html) has directly aided the Dalai Lama during the Tibetan attempt at rebellion against the CCP.  

2) The US still, to this day, [supports what is commonly seen as a separatist, rogue government in Taiwan](https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/us-taiwan-relations/).

Also, while again not directly pertinent to the issue of actual 'interference', unlike Tienanmen, this HK disturbance can be framed as a 'foreign' disturbance, because HK itself was under lease to Britain for nearly 100 years before the CCP took it over again.  Its way of life is 'foreign' to the CCP, much like how the KMT's way of life is also foreign to the CCP.

I think it's far too early to tell whether or not intelligence agencies are indeed meddling in the HK disturbance, but I will say that there does seem to be some parallels to the Arab Spring, and that was indeed [fueled by the DoD in one way or another.](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/world/15aid.html)",CQME,,e36h80,fa88pe0

Trump sued his accountants to get an injunction banning them from turning over documents that were subpoenaed from them.

While the President has so far lost that case, he currently has [a temporary stay through at least December 5th from the Supreme Court.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112519zr_7l48.pdf)

It is likely that a company like AT&T or Verizon would comply with a congressional subpoena by default.  But it is also likely that they would inform the target of the subpoena of its existence,^1 and the President or the targeted individual would then have a chance to go to court to quash the subpoena.  

In ordinary civil cases in federal courts [the right to move to quash a subpoena is limited.](https://www.compellingdiscovery.com/?p=4200) But it's much less clear how that plays into the Congressional context.

In effect, while this might be a good means for Congress to get the information they want eventually, it still would involve a number of months of litigation at a minimum.

,"I think your question is a little bit strange. Congress' power to subpeona has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else complying or not complying with prior subpoenas.

In fact, [as long as it fits three general guidelines of investigation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress#Subpoenas), they can subpoena pretty much whoever and whatever they want within the U.S. and in territories abroad.

The three criteria:

""First, the committee's investigation of the broad subject area must be authorized by its chamber; second, the investigation must pursue ""a valid legislative purpose"" but does not need to involve legislation and does not need to specify the ultimate intent of Congress; and third, the specific inquiries must be pertinent to the subject matter area that has been authorized for investigation.""

And that makes sense. Because even if **everyone** involved complied with prior subpoenas... how does the committee know that they're telling the truth? How do they know they aren't involved in an organised criminal act?

,"The ground rules for each impeachment trial are set by the senate by majority vote.  This includes rules for evidence and supeneas.  The chief justice has no say in the rules set by the senate.  So right now there is nothing limiting what rules a simple majority of senators could enact.

,">What I'm trying to figure out is what power does Roberts have here as the Presiding Officer on the trial, what powers would McConnell or Pence have as the Presiding Officer on the Senate, and what powers would the Senate as a whole have?

So a couple clarifications I think will help. 

Once the trial begins, _Roberts is the presiding officer._  For anything pre-trial, it is Pence or a Senator acting as President pro tempore.  But the Constitutional mandate that ""The Chief Justice shall preside"" combined with Rule IV (linked in OP) saying:

>said Chief Justice shall be administered the oath by the Presiding Officer of the Senate
and shall preside over the Senate during the consideration
of said articles and upon the trial of the person impeached
therein

makes it clear that Roberts will preside for the entirety of the trial.  Questions of interpretation of Senate rules, or of questions of law, would be his to deal with as the presiding officer. 

The Senate as a whole has extremely broad powers, and can vote that the President is guilty or not guilty five minutes after the articles of impeachment are presented to them if they want.  The Supreme Court ruled in [*Walter Nixon v. United States*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States) the Senate has the _sole_ power of impeachment, and its exercise of that power is unreviewable.

If 51 Senators wish to do something in respect to the impeachment trial, that is the thing which will happen.  Roberts could exercise some moral influence by e.g. ruling in a normal federal-judge sort of way on evidence or witness questions.  But the Senate can overrule him if they wish to, and the Senate's vote is the last say on any and all questions about the trial.  

Politically, it might be hard for Republican senators to e.g. vote against a Rudy Giuliani subpoena since he's such a [key witness,](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/trump-ordered-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-through-giuliani-key-witness-sondland-testifies.html) but if they want to, they can.

---

Now, the second question is what happens re: subpoena enforcement if the Senate does issue a subpoena to, say, Rudy.

Rule VI provides that the Senate Sgt. at Arms can enforce the subpoenas, but it does say he does so at the direction of ""the Senate"" as opposed to ""the Presiding Officer.""  That said, I think the fairest interpretation of the rule would be that the Chief Justice as presiding officer would speak on behalf of the Senate to give such instructions, unless the instruction were countermanded by a vote to override it.

This is supported by rule VII which says:

>And the Presiding Officer
on the trial may rule on all questions of evidence including,
but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and
redundancy of evidence and incidental questions, which
ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, unless
some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to
the Senate for decision without debate; or he may at his
option, in the first instance, submit any such question to
a vote of the Members of the Senate. Upon all such questions the vote shall be taken in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate.

""The Presiding Officer on the trial"" is absolutely the Chief Justice, and it pretty clearly says unless overriden, his rulings stand as the ""judgment of the Senate.""  So if he says to go arrest Rudy, unless overriden, the judgment of the Senate is that the sgt. at arms should go arrest Rudy.",huadpe,,e0t9bg,f8h66a1

,"I recall here the [British rail privatization](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2012/09/why-britains-railway-privatization-failed/3378/), which did not go very well. I imagine road privatization would go similarly: competing interests over a widely used system of transport that does not do well under diversification plausibly leads to a decrease in consumer safety (death tolls rose immediately in the British privatization per the above link), which I don't think would really happen in the case of a road (because it was mostly a lack of communication between different train companies that caused these problems, which doesn't really translate to a highway). More, I think it would be like Uber. It *seems* to benefit more people by being widely available and easy to use, but probably benefits those with more, more; and hurts those with less (namely in that case, [Uber drivers themselves](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uber-drivers-are-independent-contractors-not-employees-says-national-labor-relations-board/) as well as taxi drivers).

> Have there been examples in the past, or in other countries, where all (or a majority) of roads were privately owned?

Not that I can find.

> In countries that have vast private road system, was there a decrease or increase of cost on consumers of the road?

France has a quite extensive [private road system](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/02/business/the-business-world-the-private-roads-to-riches.html). Like in the US toll roads, though, it again only benefits the chunks of the population able to afford it. Working class individuals arguably have the greatest need for fast roads, but are in the least likely position to shell out the money it costs for tolls.

> Would limiting people's access to travel under burden of cost, be a violation of any human rights?

Not necessarily, and certainly not a rights violation (unless you want to consider roads a publicly owned asset, in which case maybe, depending on how the money is spent and who benefits the most/least). A perhaps more interesting solution might be [income-based taxation on road congestion](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08040/cp_prim5_03.htm) which could, like Finland fines reckless drivers in higher income brackets with higher fines, make it less likely that those who may not need the road so urgently would use it.

Even better, would be using such tax methods to better finance FREE public transit. Merely adding more lanes simply [does not work](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/06/21/the-science-is-clear-more-highways-equals-more-traffic-why-are-dots-still-ignoring-it/), primarily because you can't easily increase the size or number of the exits. You just create more lanes for traffic to sit in.

Why make public transit more accessible? [Because it reduces traffic](https://www.boredpanda.com/space-required-to-transport-60-people/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic). If you tax road usage based on income and make transit accessible, you make a huge incentive for a large number of people to use public transit more, and make it so that those who do still decide to drive operate with far less traffic. Not to mention, less traffic = less wear and tear on the roads, which means less cost to upkeep.

Privatizing, if anything, would create the opposite situation, at least if done on heavily trafficked roads. If people HAVE to use a specific road to get to work, they are more or less giving toll money to a group that, really, don't have an obligation to do maintenance and upkeep -- and, if those people are unlucky, that company (like many others) will choose profit over improvements.",i_am_average_AMA,,dy8qev,f8027wl
,"Roads.

It’s just a piece of asphalt.


They also tend to carry along complex dual wastewater systems (storm and sewer) along with potable water, natural gas, some fiber optic lines and sidewalks and signs and signals and polls for holding power-lines and lights and phone lines and 911 and other utilities near me.

But that's beside the point.  The real point about roads is simply that they are super-complex property arrangements.  You wouldn't fucking believe how complicated that little road right in front of your house probably is legally.

In the US, odds are the road itself is town or county property (public property), but the drains and sewers and water lines beneath probably belong to a sewer or water authority/commission (quasi-public property, an option libertarians totally ignore), while the gas lines belong to the gas company, and the fiber optic lines might be business-only lines that some company you've never heard of owns.  Meanwhile, the sidewalks are probably town or county property, but they are to be cleared and maintained by the residents who own street frontage (private property).  Of course, on state roads, the underlying property is state property, etc.

Meanwhile, off to the side, or (rarely) in the berm, or just off the sidewalk on the other side, one finds telephone poles.  Odds are these are randomly and haphazardly owned by either Verizon, AT&T, or your power company (private property, unless your power company is public).  But the land they sit on is rent-free public property.  And space on the pole is rented out.  So Verizon rents your power company and phone company room on the pole to string their wires. (private property).  And they give 911 and other state emergency lines space for free (public property).  And they rent the space for the streetlight to the power company.  And the power company might charge that rent back to the city/town/county.  And so-on and so-forth.

You might want to hand-wave it away and say, ""That's just unnecessarily complicated!  We don't need that to work!""  But it's actually not.  For a million reasons, it's really not.  It's a very delicate arrangement.  It'd be far easier to go the other way and declare all of it public, than to declare all of it private.

Because once all of it is private, the ultimate consumer of streetlight (I guess people who live in the area?) would have to pay rent and get permission to be bolted on a pole, which would require rent and permission for that space on the pole, which would require rent and permission from the owner of the pole, which would require rent and permission from the owner of the underlying land, which would require rent and permission from the owner of the road, who could be anybody.

So, at this point, you need to pay 6 instances of rent, even if you get everyone to agree to allow you to put the streetlight up, which means street-lighting is going to get way more expensive.  Then you have to go and beg people to pay for it, either people who live nearby or people who use the road.  You're going to get the same problem with sewer or cable lines or power lines (why would a phone company that put up the pole even let the power company string dangerous live wires along its property?)

Right now, besides the law, the ultimate cudgel the state has is to say, ""You're not paying any rent for the land your poles/pipes are on, so act right.""  You totally lose that when you privatize it.  Any incentive for all these different companies to work together goes away instantly.  What a nightmare!

That's the big reason why ""Who will build the roads?"" is a valid question.  Because roads bring with them all public utilities.  Unless everyone in NYC is supposed to go back to heating and lighting with oil and shitting and bathing in the East River in a pre-telephone-communications era, we need public utilities and cannot live without them.  And they operate along roads, based on the public property arrangements they provide.

,"The closest comparison I can really point out would be something like the British Railway [privatization.](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2012/09/why-britains-railway-privatization-failed/3378/) Where a private system was made a public utility, then dissected back into the hands of private entities again afterwards.

Of course, roads and rail are two different beasts, and the article does explain one of the biggest differences: The connection between the maintenance of the road and the railcars themselves is vastly more important than that of a road and the cars. In other words, private maintenance of a car is the expected model, and outside of the road being entirely compromised, even rough roads can still be used, and so road maintenance has a wider range of variance. Whereas with rail lines, even minor damage to rails can create a situation that endangers lives or the transit of goods, as such you'd never really want to be in a situation where you weren't in charge of the maintenance if you were the one driving your vehicle over it.

So, while there might be massive differences between the modes of transit, the methods of privatization can also inherently introduce problems between the profitability of a thing, and it's safety or usability. Such as in your scenario, just suddenly privatizing current roads. Is the public the one having to pay to get roads up to code, as it were? Cause [there'd be a lot of infrastructure that's in need of a lot of repair](https://www.businessinsider.com/american-infrastructure-falling-apart-2017-2) just to get it back up to on par with what it should already be. So if the public isn't paying for these things \*now\*, these repairs then would have to transfer into the hands of private ownership, which would have one of two large hiccups in whether or not this makes economic sense to them.

Either they're up-fronting a lot of funds to repair things, which means large amounts of initial costs, which transfers into either pressures to charge higher-than-average costs (depending on how this private ownership ends up), or potentially never end up profitable, as a much larger percentage of revenues goes to pay off the repair costs, while the idea of tolling roads multiplying exponentially overnight would no doubt push down overall driving.

Or, like what they did with the railway privatization, they try to separate out things like the maintenance of the infrastructure to another entity (be it another company or the public), which may still run into the previous problems. Or, if that maintenance comes down to the public sector, they may never fund it. After all, it'd be quite unpopular a position for a politician to argue in favor of publicly funding maintenance for a private entity. Things like new sports stadiums are always a big hotbed of these sorts of issues.

Now, tack onto this, the legal vulnerabilities this would open up these new owners to, as now they would be the entities most responsible for damage done to vehicles by poor roads. Which even further would either push them away from wanting to own said roads, or from wanting to be the entities in charge of maintenance anyway.

Keep in mind this quote from the article you noted as advocates reflecting on early private roads:

>However, the turnpike movement had its problems. About a third of the chartered companies failed to construct any roads, and many turnpikes that were completed paid very small dividends or none at all. Toll evasion was rampant, as people learned to go around the tollgates, a practice known as “shunpiking.” In many cases, roads were built in advance of settlement, where travel demand was low. Furthermore, legal restrictions hampered the turnpikes’ abilities to turn a profit. Toll rates were set by law; generous toll exemptions were granted to local travelers; tollgates were separated by great distances; and countermeasures to shunpiking were denied legislative approval.

Also:

>Civil engineers and enthusiasts predicted that plank roads would last eight years before needing to be resurfaced. But, to the chagrin of everyone, the planks wore out twice as fast as the experts had predicted-usually within four years. The movement ended as suddenly as it began. Most plank road companies folded, while many converted their operations to turnpikes surfaced with gravel.

In other words, most of these early projects just didn't work as well as anyone had hoped, and this was in an era before the mass adoption of the motor vehicle, with a smaller population. That doesn't mean that we haven't learned anything between then and now, but the cost of modern infrastructure, and the demands that are placed upon it, are so far from what these early private roads had to deal with, or was expected of them, that it'd be difficult to really point out what was even all that beneficial of it compared to what we even currently have. The article even mentions that public entities didn't trust private entities, hence why tolls were limited by law, or some local travel was given exemptions.   


Also, [shunpiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunpiking) is more the act of avoiding toll roads altogether, not bypassing the toll gates, but that's just on the article writer trying to make it sound like there was some organized practice of bypassing toll gates, rather than overall toll road avoidance.

Sure, some roads were more beneficial than zero roads, but this model of transferring ownership of public roads doesn't rely on there being no roads in the first place.

This kinda highlights my point previously, from that same article:

>In 1992 Congress passed the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which, according to Robert Poole of the Reason Foundation “contains the most sweeping privatization provisions ever enacted by Congress.” ISTEA reverses the 76-year policy against toll roads. Under this act, federal funds can now go toward toll roads, including private toll roads, and states no longer have to repay federal funds if a facility is privatized. America can again test the effectiveness of private management of highways and the economic value of user charges.

Now, would you, as a taxpayer, want any money going towards roads that you might ultimately have to also pay extra to drive on? Or rather, would the same individuals that are keen on selling privatization of the public sector, also expect the public sector to pay for their 'start up company' if the logic of overall improvement under privatization were sound? The system as it stands could theoretically start flopping down roads and hand them over to private ownership. Why haven't they (other than just how unpopular that'd likely make you come next election cycle)?",ampillion,,dy8qev,f8098qj

The way this is being proposed is not what we conceptualize as a private highway here in the US.

We already see the partial private operation of public highways with companies with [FasTrak](https://thetollroads.com/accounts/fastrak/california). 

Unfortunately, I think it just boils down the entire thing to time vs. money--in some cases you could take public transportation to get to some of the places where toll roads take you, but the cost savings often mean you're giving up a lot of time, and it's not always a concession people are capable of making.

I think it transfers the problem down stream on the ownership and operation of the car. It'd be more effective to move it up stream (e.g. more cost restrictive licensing/registration) so that people aren't getting to the point where it's too expensive once it comes time to fuel the car and drive it on the roads.

Any form of toll by its very nature puts far higher costs on the road user because the costs of the road are borne solely by the users of the road, rather than by society as a whole (this is probably a good thing). Additionally, where a road is run by a private, for-profit company, there is a need to extract money for shareholders (definitely a bad thing).

A minor nitpick that may help answer this question for you: Brexit was technically not decided with the referendum. The result of the referendum was advisory (i.e. It only indicated to parliament what course of action had popular assent).

The act of parliament (i.e. that specific part of Britain's constitution) that brought the referendum into being [doesn't actually say anything about whether the result should be implemented; only that there should be one.](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/36/contents/enacted)

So while Parliament's actions following the result (and I guess, before) may be contentious, they do not in my view represent a constitutional crisis.

After the referendum it passed [another law](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/European_Union_(Notification_of_Withdrawal\)_Act_2017) making it's actions licit.

,"No legal barrier exists. The pertinent section of the US Constitution to how each state selects its members of the Electoral College is Article II, Section 1, Clause 2:

>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.

([source](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America#Section_2_1)). As you can see from this clause, the power of selecting the electors is granted to each state in a very broad fashion. In fact, there is no requirement that the state even hold an election. In a number of historical cases, the state legislature has directly itself made the selection (though not in more than a century).",mtn_climber,,duep10,f77io2x
,"A significant barrier to implementing ranked choice voting is a reluctance on the part of elected officials to change the current system where the winner only needs a plurality. For example, in the 2019 legislative session in Virginia, multiple bills were introduced that would have made ranked choice voting optional for local districts to implement on their own, and in all cases, they died in committee ([SB1731](https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1021838), [HB2751](https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1022690), [HB2097](https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1004991)).

One can speculate as to the reasons for their reluctance, but I think a lot of it comes down to a lack of education about the ranked choice voting system and fear of its implications due to that lack of education. For example, with SB1731, [Senator Cosgrove's stated reason for not supporting the bill is that he fears it would take too long to retabulate the results when there is no clear majority][4], despite the fact that [ranked choice voting is already used in several other locations across the country][5].

,"In response to Rep Biggs regarding high crimes and misdemeanors bribery is explicitly mentioned in the constitution but even so criminal statutes aren’t tied to it either since there were no federal statutes as noted here 

https://www.lawfareblog.com/constitution-says-bribery-impeachable-what-does-mean


>Now that Congress has launched an impeachment investigation into President Trump’s effort to use the Ukrainian government to target a political rival, much ink has been spilled on the question of whether Trump’s actions amount to “high crimes and misdemeanors” for which he may be impeached. In analyzing the president’s conduct, some commentators have pointed to one of the two specific grounds for impeachment enumerated in the Constitution: bribery. Yet, by and large, those who have examined Trump’s efforts to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as potential bribery have done so through the narrow lens of modern federal statutory criminal law.

And further the article notes this 

>Recall that Article II, Section 4, says the president “shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” In contrast to the prescriptive definition of “treason” in Article III, Section 3, the term “bribery” is not defined there or elsewhere in the constitutional text. **Some of Trump’s defenders have taken advantage of that silence by attempting to apply the standard in the modern federal criminal bribery statute, arguing that impeachment for bribery is off the table unless there is a quid pro quo. They claim that Trump’s conduct falls short of that standard because he did not explicitly link the withheld aid to the requested investigation of a political rival.**

>In fact, Trump’s conduct almost certainly satisfies the modern statutory standard for bribery. As Randall Eliason has explained, a quid pro quo “need not be stated in express terms; corrupt actors are seldom so clumsy, and the law may not be evaded through winks and nods.” We have little doubt that a prosecutor would be able to establish a quid pro quo based on what was said on the call and the surrounding facts and context. (As an aside, Trump’s conduct also likely qualifies as extortion. As James Lindgren has explained at length, historically there has been a substantial overlap between the concepts of extortion and bribery, and around the time of the Founding, the terms were often used to describe the same conduct.)

>**But even if Trump’s actions do not satisfy the modern criminal standard for bribery, the argument from Trump’s defenders is misplaced—because the federal statute isn’t the relevant statement of the law in the context of impeachment.**

>**The Founders had no intent of tying the constitutional definition of bribery to federal criminal statutory law. On the most basic level, no federal criminal code existed at the time that the Constitution was drafted. Beyond that, the Framers had no reason to believe that Congress would enact federal criminal statutes in the future. As Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz explain in their comprehensive book on impeachment, “To End a Presidency,” criminal law was understood to be the province of the states, and there was very little federal criminal law at all until the mid-20th century. To the extent there was federal criminal law, it followed the common law model. That is why the concept of high crimes and misdemeanors can’t be limited by federal statutes. The same goes for bribery—as there was no general federal bribery statute at all until 1853.**",Adama0001,,dud70c,f74n7d7
,"This is slightly tangential but if you're generally asking which laws were broken, remember that the bribery/extortion in question involved uncertainty of whether the Executive Branch would, without ""a favor"" in return, dispatch military aid that had been specifically appropriated by Congress. [The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 makes it illegal](https://budget.house.gov/publications/report/impoundment-control-act-1974-what-it-why-does-it-matter) for the President to impound (withhold) Congressionally appropriated funds unless he seeks and receives permission from Congress, which he did not. The Government Accountability Office [is investigating](https://www.wsj.com/articles/congressional-watchdog-reviewing-hold-on-ukraine-aid-11573152399) whether delaying the Ukraine aid was illegal all by itself, aside from all the other circumstances about why it was delayed.

However, as far as I can see there is no specific enforcement mechanism; this is one of those laws that are expected to be followed because that's just how government normally works. As usual, impeachment and removal from office is the only constitutional remedy for a lawbreaking president, but it doesn't seem like he could be arrested and prosecuted for appropriations impoundment after leaving office.",Epistaxis,,dud70c,f77662k
,"I think this is a really good question that I have given quite a bit of thought to.  And I think there are two critical pieces (in my view) to this question.

1.The biggest evidence that I have seen that suggests Trump requested a favor in exchange for aid is [Gordon sondland saying that he told Ukraine that they would likely need to announce a corruption investigation before receiving aid. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html)

The critical piece of this is that he hasn't said that President Trump directed him to say this.  He was giving his personal opinion on the matter. So (from what we've seen so far) there is no smoking gun that Trump directly suggested this quid pro quo to anyone.

The argument could definitely be made that his cabinet are working on his behalf and that he's responsible for for their message to foreign leaders.  But the argument could also be made that he was unaware of this message.


2.The second key point to me is if the request is for personal political benefit or for the benefit of US foreign relations.  On one hand, the argument could be made that Trump wasn't interested in weeding out corruption and that he was merely trying to smear a political opponent.  One piece of evidence supporting this is that Sondland (same source as above) says that Ukraine would need to ""publicly announce the investigation into Biden"".  Not just ""find any wrongdoing"", but more like ""make sure its public"" kind of thing.  That seems to make it look like a smear campaign which would definitley make it for personal gain rather than for weeding out corruption and improving the relationship.

But there is certainly arguments that there is a legitimate concern with US relations particularly pertaining to Biden. Trump could make the argument that he wanted to clean up corruption in US politics and that because Biden is a political opponent, he couldn't investigate him directly. So he requested a third party.

And a third aspect is about *precedent*. It's obviously common for presidents to request certain action in exchange for aid.  But is there a precedent for past presidents to give aid in exchange for personal gain?  Ironically, the entire investigation into Biden is about exactly that.  [Biden himself admitted to withholding a billion dollars in aid until the prosecutor investigating Burisma Holdings was fired. ](https://youtu.be/UXA--dj2-CY)


And that is *potentially* (not proven) to be a personal benefit because Biden's son was given a seat on the board of that company when Biden began working with Ukraine.  [Hunter Biden had no experience in fossil fuels and never even visited the Ukraine during his time on the board of the company. ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hunter-biden-ukraine-idUSKBN1WX1P7)

We don't know exactly what motivated Sondland's claim that Trump would withhold the $400 million in funding and we don't know exactly what motivated Biden to withhold $1 billion in funding.  But IMO, if they aren't *both* investigated, then we risk giving Trump an argument that there was a precedent of quid pro quo and that he is being attacked for trying to expose it.


The short answer is that I don't think there has been any smoking gun evidence yet.  But the investigation is ongoing. It's probably not worth committing *too* much thought to until the interviews are completed.",B0h1c4,,dud70c,f78524m
,"Based on the cited passage, President Trump's request to President Zelenskiy would need to fulfill two criteria:

* President Trump must corruptly seek to receive something personally valuable.
* President Trump's performance of an official act must be influenced by the receipt of the thing of personal value.

President Trump's request for President Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden's activities with Burisma does not meet these criteria.

###Corruptly demanding, seeking, receiving, accepting, or agreeing to receive or accept
The usage of the word ""corruptly"" in the language suggests that the offer being made has no legitimate basis in law.

In the case of a request to investigate possible criminal activity by Hunter Biden, there is in fact a legal avenue for President Trump to do so: the [Treaty with Ukraine on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters](https://www.congress.gov/treaty-document/106th-congress/16/document-text). This treaty was signed by President Clinton with Ukraine in 1998, ratified by Congress in October of 2000, and remains in full force and effect.

From the description of the Treaty contained in the Letter of Submittal to the Senate:

> Article 1 sets forth **a non-exclusive list of the major types of assistance to be provided under the Treaty**, including taking the testimony or statements of persons; providing documents, records and other items of evidence; locating or identifying persons or items; serving documents; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other purposes; executing requests for searches and seizures; assisting in proceedings related to immobilization and forfeiture of assets, restitution, and collection of fines; and, rendering any other form of assistance not prohibited by the laws of the Requested State. The scope of the Treaty includes not only criminal offenses, but also proceedings related to criminal matters, which may be civil or administrative in nature.

> Article 1(3) states that **assistance shall be provided without regard to whether the conduct involved would constitute an offense under the laws of the Requested State.**

If President Trump has reason to believe that Hunter Biden may have violated US laws through activity related to his role on Burisma's board, even if such actions did not violate Ukrainian law, it is within the scope of the treaty for him to request Ukraine's assistance in investigating it.

However, it must be noted that the treaty specifies that any such formal requests must be made through the Office of the Attorney General.

###Anything of value personally or for any other person or entity
Assuming that the delivery of aid was conditioned upon Ukraine opening an investigation into Hunter Biden's activities, such an ask can arguably be seen as within the boundaries of commonplace policymaking.

What is commonly referred to as ""political horse-trading"" forms the basis for modern representative democracy. It is the primary tool that politicians use to get their colleagues to support causes they otherwise would not care about.

During the trial of former Governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich, a panel of federal judges affirmed that horse-trading (sometimes also referred to as ""log-rolling"") is the meat-and-potatoes of politics, pointing out that one of the charges sent to them by the trial judge was not a crime, but politics as usual. Blagojevich was alleged to have asked President-elect Obama to give him one of the following in exchange for appointing Valerie Jarrett to Obama's vacated seat in the Senate:

* A cabinet-level position for Blagojevich.
* Persuading a foundation to hire Blagojevich with a high salary after his term as Governor was over.
* Persuading someone to donate ~$10 million to set up a new social welfare organization that Blagojevich would head.

[Judge Easterbrook, writing for a unanimous court,](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1708436.html) said that of those three, asking for a cabinet-level position was not illegal because it was exchanging one public act for another, and further stated that governance would largely be impossible if such mechanisms of political bargaining were outlawed:

> But a problem in the way the instructions told the jury to consider the evidence requires us to vacate the convictions on counts that concern Blagojevich's proposal to appoint Valerie Jarrett to the Senate in exchange for an appointment to the Cabinet. A jury could have found that Blagojevich asked the President-elect for a private-sector job, or for funds that he could control, but the instructions permitted the jury to convict even if it found that his only request of Sen. Obama was for a position in the Cabinet. The instructions treated all proposals alike. We conclude, however, that they are legally different: **a proposal to trade one public act for another, a form of logrolling, is fundamentally unlike the swap of an official act for a private payment...**

> **McCormick describes the offense as a quid pro quo: a public official performs an official act (or promises to do so) in exchange for a private benefit,** such as money. See also United States v. Sun–Diamond Growers of California, 526 U.S. 398, 404–05 (1999); United States v. McDonnell, 2015 U.S.App. LEXIS 11889 (4th Cir. July 10, 2015). **A political logroll, by contrast, is the swap of one official act for another.** Representative A agrees with Representative B to vote for milk price supports, if B agrees to vote for tighter controls on air pollution. A President appoints C as an ambassador, which Senator D asked the President to do, in exchange for D's promise to vote to confirm E as a member of the National Labor Relations Board. **Governance would hardly be possible without these accommodations, which allow each public official to achieve more of his principal objective while surrendering something about which he cares less, but the other politician cares more strongly.**

Assuming that release of the military aid was in fact conditioned on Ukraine opening an investigation into Hunter Biden and Burisma, it was the exchange of one public act for another, and (at least according to Easterbrook et al.) cannot be considered a criminal act for purposes of 18 USC § 201(b).

**EDIT:** Clarified that the actions in question do not appear illegal under the cited statute. This post is not meant to exclude the possibility that President Trump's actions are in violation of some other law.",Choppa_Pilot,,dud70c,f75k0up

He basically argues the following:

&#x200B;

>For starters, neither President Trump nor President Zelensky mentions either the 2016 or 2020 presidential elections, let alone a possible role for Zelensky to interfere in 2020. Nor is there the hint of tension, let alone pressure, anywhere in this conversational lovefest where each man tries to outflatter the other. Trump does boast that “we do a lot for Ukraine,” but far from this being some kind of veiled threat, that observation only serves as an opening wedge for the President to slam Angela Merkel of Germany and a “lot of the European countries” for freeriding off the United States by underinvesting in their own defense. Zelensky agrees “\[n\]ot only 100% but actually 1000%” about Merkel.

>Buoyed by the news, Trump gets personal and asks, “I would like you to do us a favor.” Schiff and Axelrod complete the sentence with the same nontextual embellishment, “of digging up dirt on an opponent.” What was actually said thereafter had nothing whatsoever to do with Biden or his son Hunter. Rather, Trump offered a maddeningly vague set of remarks that asked Zelensky “to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike”—a one-off reference to the American cybersecurity firm—which was followed by an equally vague suggestion “to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.” It is not clear what “it” refers to, but in the next sentence Trump indicates that he was still clearly irritated by the recently concluded Mueller Congressional testimony, which he rightly described as “an incompetent performance.”",etiennenoel,,dud70c,f74xqaf

Joe Biden / Hunter Biden / Bill Taylor / Burisma / Adam Schiff / Thomas Eager are all interconnected, this in my opinion looks like there are colluding interests...

Itinerary for a trip to Ukraine in August organized by the Atlantic Council think tank reveals that a staffer on Rep. Adam Schiff’s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held a meeting during the trip with acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, now a key witness for Democrats pursuing impeachment.

Taylor himself has evidenced a close relationship with the Atlantic Council ([Bursima is a donor](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Atlantic-Council-Annual-Report-2018%E2%80%932019.pdf)), writing analysis pieces published on the Council’s website and serving as a featured speaker for the organization’s events. He also served for nine years as senior advisor to the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, which has co-hosted scores of events with the Atlantic Council.

Thomas Eager, a staffer on Schiff’s House Intelligence Committee, took a trip to Ukraine in August billed as a bipartisan “Ukraine Study Trip” in which ten Congressional staffers participated.

Eager is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship, a bipartisan program that [says](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/eurasia-center/eurasia-congressional-fellowship/) it “educates congressional staff on current events in the Eurasia region.” The pre-planned Ukraine trip was part of the fellowship program.

Burisma in January 2017 [signed](https://burisma-group.com/eng/news/the-atlantic-council-of-the-united-states-and-burisma-group-sign-cooperative-agreement/) a “cooperative agreement” with the Council to specifically sponsor the organization’s Eurasia Center, the same center that sponsored Eager’s Ukraine trip.

A closer look at the itinerary for the August 24 to August 31 trip shows that the delegation’s first meeting upon arrival in Ukraine was with Taylor.

In the leaked pre-written full opening statement, Taylor alluded to work he said he did for a “small Ukrainian non- governmental organization” but he omitted the name of the organization. “In the intervening 10 years, I have stayed engaged with Ukraine, visiting frequently since 2013 as a board member of a small Ukrainian non- governmental organization supporting good governance and reform,” he said.

The name of the organization is the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC), where Taylor served for nine years as a senior advisor. The USUBC has co-hosted or participated in scores of events with the Atlantic Council. Taylor has also authored numerous analysis pieces published by the Atlantic Council itself and has co-authored op-eds written together with the Atlantic Council’s director.

Burisma is a key financial backer of the Atlantic Council. In 2017, Burisma and the Atlantic Council [signed](https://burisma-group.com/eng/news/the-atlantic-council-of-the-united-states-and-burisma-group-sign-cooperative-agreement/) a cooperative agreement to develop transatlantic programs with Burisma’s financial support reportedly to focus “on European and international energy security.” Burisma specifically finances the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.

Besides funding the Atlantic Council, Burisma also routinely partners with the think tank. Only four months ago, the company [co-hosted](https://burisma-group.com/eng/news/burisma-group-co-hosts-annual-kharkiv-security-conference-on-strengthening-ukraine-s-cyber-defenses/) the Atlantic Council’s second Annual Kharkiv Security Conference.  Burisma [advertises](https://burisma-group.com/eng/news/burisma-group-commits-to-atlantic-council-s-principles-for-economic-policy-and-judicial-reform-in-Ukraine/) that it committed itself to “15 key principles of rule of law and economic policy in Ukraine developed by the Atlantic Council.”

The Atlantic Council [featured](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/real-advice-not-platitudes-keeps-kyiv-on-reform-path/) an oped co-authored by Taylor in which the diplomat argued Ukraine “has further to travel toward its self-proclaimed European goal” of reformation.

Thomas Eager, a staffer on Schiff’s House Intelligence Committee, took a trip to Ukraine in August billed as a bipartisan “Ukraine Study Trip” in which ten Congressional staffers participated.

Eager is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship, a bipartisan program that [says](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/eurasia-center/eurasia-congressional-fellowship/) it “educates congressional staff on current events in the Eurasia region.” The pre-planned Ukraine trip was part of the fellowship program.

Burisma in January 2017 [signed](https://burisma-group.com/eng/news/the-atlantic-council-of-the-united-states-and-burisma-group-sign-cooperative-agreement/) a “cooperative agreement” with the Council to specifically sponsor the organization’s Eurasia Center, the same center that sponsored Eager’s Ukraine trip.

A closer look at the itinerary for the August 24 to August 31 trip shows that the delegation’s first meeting upon arrival in Ukraine was with Taylor.

,"As with any legal issue, it's pretty complicated. I'll discuss the easy stuff first. 

**Op-Ed and Book:** 

Of course we haven't seen the contents of the book yet, but the op-ed merely states the author's concern and disdain for the behavior of the President and his administration. By all definitions this person would not be considered a [whistleblower](https://www.whistleblower.org/what-is-a-whistleblower/) and would therefore not have any special protections. That being said, as long as the op-ed author doesn't reveal classified information, there's no legal basis for the President to force disclosure of their identity, e.g. by the NYT or by the book publishers. However there may be some legal maneuvering that the Administration can do - right now their angle is to claim that the book potentially violates a [nondisclosure agreement](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/anonymous-book-justice-department-letter/index.html). Whether or not the administration can proceed with a lawsuit will seemingly depend heavily on the specific information presented in the book and whether the information would have needed to go through a [pre-review process](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-files-civil-lawsuit-against-edward-snowden-publishing-book-violation-cia-and). 

**Juror:** 

Our courts have [extensive protocols](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/criminal/criminal-law-basics/the-process-of-questioning-potential-jurors.html) in place for selecting jurors and removing jurors who are explicitly or implicitly biased, or otherwise cannot perform the function of a juror. It is the responsibility of Stone and his Lawyers to screen the Jury and remove people who would be biased against him. They even have the power to remove jurors for no stated reason using peremptory challenges. IANAL, but I can't imagine how releasing personal information of the jurors wouldn't be explicit witness tampering and jury intimidation - and it's possible [Jones is culpable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/07/alex-jones-threatened-name-roger-stone-juror-experts-say-that-might-be-jury-tampering/) despite the fact that his information was wrong. Speaking personal, on an ethical level, this is insanity. Our justice system obviously understands how crucial an impartial jury is to justice, and has a system to try to ensure that. Revealing jurors information puts them at serious risk of retaliation, and intimidates other jurors with the implicit threat that they too will be revealed. It's a direct attack on the core of our justice system. 

**Ukraine:**

Ok so now the difficult one. [This article](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/462464-timeline-the-trump-whistleblower-complaint) provides a good timeline of events to understand the whistleblower complaint. The whistleblower filed a complained with the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG), Michael Atkinson, in accordance with whistleblower protocol. The ICIG found this report to be a credible complaint and forwarded it to the director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who had just been sworn in after his predecessor, Sue Gordon, [resigned](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/sue-gordon-has-resigned-deputy-director-national-intelligence-n1040616). Maguire had 14 days to forward this complaint to congress, but refused to do so, which [many have claimed is illegal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/joseph-maguire-intelligence.html). Seemingly agreeing with this sentiment, Atkinson [wrote a letter](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-09-26/read-the-inspector-generals-letter-about-the-ukraine-whistleblower) to Adam Schiff alerting him of the existence of the complaint, but did not describe the substance of the complaint itself.

For the context of your question I think I can stop the timeline there, since that's now beyond the involvement of the whistleblower himself. So legally: the whistleblower used the proper channels to report a complaint, the ICIG reviewed the complaint and agreed that it was a valid complaint of ""urgent concern"", and passed it on to the director of national intelligence to submit to congress. So as far as the initial whistleblower complaint it seems to fall entirely under the purvue of the existing whistleblower laws, which explicitly prohibit (edited) Maguire from revealing the name of the whistleblower, implicitly prohibit anyone in the intelligence community from revealing it, [but possibly allow the president to reveal it](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/06/776481504/can-trump-legally-out-the-whistleblower-experts-say-it-would-not-violate-any-law). It is noteworthy that [Maguire himself](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/intelligence-chief-maguire-will-testify-to-congress-about-whistleblower-complaint/2019/09/25/ee98ae7c-dfb4-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html) testified that the whistleblower followed the law in good faith and is therefore protected under existing whistleblower statutes. Technically speaking, revealing the name of the whistleblower isn't explicitly forbidden by any written law, but ""retaliation"" against the whistleblower is, and many [argue](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/politics/legal-question-out-whistleblower/index.html) that doing so would lead to a lawsuit claiming retaliation. 

So let's try to address your questions, specifically: 

>To what extent is their anonymity protected by ethical standards, legal statute, and prior precedent? 

**Ethically:** I mean it seems like everyone acknowledges how unethical it is as it clearly presents a risk to the whistleblower. It clearly goes againt the spirit of whistleblower protections to reveal the name of the whistleblower and to publicly attack them in the media.  

**Legally:** Technically Trump or anyone outside the intelligence community could out the whistleblower, and then the whistleblower could claim retaliation. Unfortunately for the whistleblower they would have to claim retaliation through an [internal process](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/politics/legal-question-out-whistleblower/index.html), which seems unlikely to help them. 

As for precedent...I know it's a low-effort answer but I really don't think this administration cares about precedent. 

So in summary, the whistleblower doesn't actually have anything in the form of written law protecting them from being outed, except by Maguire himself. And specifically for the President, as we're learning in the course of this administration, while we have extensive laws and policies governing just about everyone else's behavior, nobody really knows what laws apply to the President. In short (if jokes are allowed on this sub), we now know that the president can basically do [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/El4dPLW) to justify their behavior, and the only real recourse is impeachment.

Edit: I'll just add a personal opinion down here. This whole administration is making it extremely obvious how many things rely on common sense, norms, and precedents, and how vulnerable all of those are to being abused. We desperately need to codify a TON of things into law ASAP to protect our institutions.",BananaScientist,,du55fy,f72euxd

,"Politically, Baby Boomers are more likely to identify as [conservative](https://news.gallup.com/poll/181325/baby-boomers-likely-identify-conservative.aspx). In that same article, there are details showing that Millenials are more likely to identify as liberal. That is a clear political difference.

Economically, at the same points in their lives, 1/3 of Millennials are expected to own their homes, while 3/4s of Boomers [were](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-baby-boomers-financial-behavior-money-habits-2019-4).

There is a vast difference in economics realities between the two groups. Economic inequality has [risen](https://www.businessinsider.com/social-mobility-is-on-the-decline-and-with-it-american-dream-2017-7) for a long time, and with it social mobility has declined. When Baby Boomers were the age of Millennials, Boomers experienced more social mobility and economic prosperity. Millennials experience less prosperity and social mobility.

Overall the [research](https://www.people-press.org/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/) is clear: younger Americans (Gen X, Gen Z and Mellennials) are more Liberal than older generations -- Boomers and Silent Generation. Including Gen X as is done in this linked study shows something remarkable. When we talk about younger generations, if it includes Gen X, we're talking about people recently turning 50. Gen X and younger have become more Liberal since 2011; while Baby Boomers and Silent Generation have become more conservative over the same period of time.

There is a political schism between the two groups. How vast a schism this is relative to history is unclear. There was no Pew Research Group studying demographics and generational differences in 1861. Generational studies are generally for the benefit of advertising which was not such a robust field then. However the Pew Research group does believe that the current schism is among of the largest they've ever measured, and ""[the largest in decades.](https://www.people-press.org/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/)""

According to this article,[Baby Boomers have around 3/5ths of the total wealth in America](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-09/one-percenters-close-to-surpassing-wealth-of-u-s-middle-class). If it was simply a matter of growing old and earning money over time, the Silent Generation would not be so poor. The economic differences between Boomers and everyone else is vast. This is a combination of radically dropped taxes on the wealthy at a time where Boomers were poised to experience vast wealth growth on the Stock Market while younger groups (Gen Xers and Millenials) were not.  


So when one group claims another group is out of touch, it may be true; the two sides do not experience the same economy or nation.",d36williams,,dtodzn,f6yd64m
,"While it isn't directly relevant to the other questions in your post [this source](https://www.marketwatch.com/graphics/college-debt-now-and-then/) is certainly a good start on the whole issue. A significant portion of the economic market has shifted, and it tends to leave a huge gap in the frame of reference for older individuals.

>Taking into account tuition, room, board, and fees across 2,312 public and private colleges and universities in the U.S., the average price of an undergraduate degree increased $63,973, or roughly 161%, since 1987. (These numbers and the rest that follow have been adjusted for inflation)

I'd like to point out that in this case boomers were not the ones going to college during that time, and the inflation gap is likely to be significantly larger between when they were in college and now. On top of that, it is much harder after the 2008 recession to pay back student debt as there has been a freeze on wage growth. (There is a chart in the source, but nothing quotable.)

To put an even deeper pin on the issue, there have been significant changes to the type of jobs available to people ([source](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/10/06/1-changes-in-the-american-workplace/)), which often negates the fact that more jobs are available. The problem here is that most jobs nowadays require more soft skills and training. 

>Employment opportunities increasingly lie in jobs requiring higher-level social or analytical skills, or both. Physical or manual skills, as much in demand as social or analytical skills some three decades ago, are fading in importance. Not coincidentally, employment is rising faster in jobs calling for greater preparation, whether through education, experience or other forms of training.

Because of this, an education is significantly more necessary in today's job market. All of these things combine together to show that, as a generation, millenials are having to work harder to get the same kind of distance out of life.

For the rest of this, I don't have a particular source as a cursory google search didn't pull up the type of result I was looking for (whether affirming or denying the claims I am about to make). As such, if anyone else can present a source it would be much appreciated. 

A particular problem that millenials have with the older generations is a kind of 'me first, and now' mentality that has run rampant through economic and social policy. Largely, corporations and individuals have employed ideas that profit them now and push off the problems to let someone else deal with the issue. Global warming is a great example of this. 

For years, scientists have known about the effects and could reasonably point to various causes that should have been limited. Instead, people kept passing the buck saying that 'someone else will fix it' or 'science will find a cure in 20 years'. Unfortunately, it has now come to the attention of younger generations that we no longer have the time to work on a fix for these sorts of things. Instead of working on it and giving us more time to fix it, previous generations just made things worse. Because of that, millenials have taken a much more active voice in issues that need to be worked on and fixed. On top of that, since we can see the results of not working towards being better, there is a perception that older generations were lazy in their treatment of issues causing the problems to grow disproportionately. 

While I can't speak directly to many of the other questions in your post, I think this sets a good basis for the schism between the two groups. 

One see the other as uppity and demanding, fighting for things that boomers themselves didn't have at that age.

The other group looks down upon the previous generation as lazy and making the problems we now face worse by their inaction.",mcspaddin,,dtodzn,f6yer2m
,"EDIT: At the bottom of this post I have added more recent data and a small updated analysis.

Below is copy and pasted from a comment I made years ago in a similar thread:

BLS and Census data for median family incomes in 2012 dollars.

1970: $58,546

2007: $58,485

2012: $50,964

Just the raw numbers show a 13% drop since 1970. The problem is,  that the median income doesn't show how much less the people who are in the bottom half make. Their wages have declined even more than that 13%, while the income at the top has skyrocketed.

So let me dig that data out of the Census Bureau archives. Bear with me here because how they broke data down in the 70s was by dollar amount not by percentile so I had to pick the closest numbers.

Income is in 2011 dollars so I didn't have to convert all the census data. And the numbers in the table are the percentile limits of that income bracket. At 95%, that means that's the top 5% of income earners. 95% of people make less than that amount.

|Income|1970|2011|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$11,594|4.6||
|$12,000||10.0|
|$17,392|8.9||
|$20,262||20.0|
|$28,986|19.1||
|$50,054||50.0|
|$57,973|50.9||
|$86,960|77.7||
|$101,582||80.0|
|$143,611||90.0|
|$144,934|95.4||
|$186,000||95.0|

As you can see the income distribution has changed drastically. Today our rich are richer and our poor are poorer and more numerous. More than twice as many people live in potentially poverty level households.

The bottom 10% make about 30% less.    
The 10-20% range makes 30% less.    
The 20-50% range makes about 13% less.    
The 50-80% range makes about 27% more.    
The 80-95% range makes about 28% more.  

Those numbers tell a story.

As you can see and as I suspected we have made some gains across the board. The further we distance ourselves from the conditions of the 2008 recession the better things are getting.

Some things are staying the same though. The gains towards the bottom are the most modest. The gains near the middle have brought us nearer to where things were in 1970. While the gains at the top are accelerating. 

**Comparing 1970 to 2017:**

The bottom 10% make about 26% less.    
The 10-20% range makes 23% less.    
The 20-50% range makes about 4% less.    
The 50-80% range makes about 32% more.    
The 80-95% range makes about 48% more.  

Those numbers continue to tell a story.

While the better economy and retiring boomers are putting pressure on wages to increase, those pressures are clearly being felt much more at the top than at the bottom. Households in the middle and at the bottom continue to feel the brunt of the decline in wages while households at the top have not had it better.

,"Can you clarify your actual question? Your title asks about economic differences, but your post body is all about political differences, and you seem to be both asking about differences back when boomers (and genx?) were at the same age as well as any current schism. Is there any one question you are focused on or are you really asking about all of these? :-)",fishling,,dtodzn,f6yd7uz
,"I've been wanting to answer this more in depth for a while and I've done a bit of digging for more information that I want to share.  Few of these numbers come from primary sources, but they seem trustworthy enough and seem to fit with my understanding of the world anecdotally, but please if you have better info in either data, experience, or confounding factors between them, please bring them up.  For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to try to keep all values in 2015 dollars.

Whenever this question has come up online people always post a picture like [this](http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cost-of-living-chart.jpg), or quote some article with similar numbers.  The tl;dr of all these articles and the consensus among young people today seems to be that the cost of living was significantly lower for boomers, and that most consumer goods were roughly the same price as today with the exception of homes, automobiles, and educations being wildly cheaper for boomers.  I don't feel that this paints an entirely fair picture and I'm going to try my best to understand what life was like in the 70s, when boomers were coming of age, to compare it with millennials today.

**Housing**

Per that link, average new home prices in 1975 were $209k vs $270k.  However, there's two key things to note in that 1) new construction in 1975 was vastly different than today and 2) the lending industry and economic policy was vastly different than today.  [In 1971, just 18% of homes had an automatic dishwasher, 83% had a refridgerator, and 73% had a washing machine](https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/were-still-waiting-on-the-dishwasher-utopia-1496632923).  [In 75, only half of homes built had air conditioning](https://streets.mn/2018/07/24/chart-of-the-day-share-of-homes-with-central-air-conditioning-1970-present/).  Lead paint and asbestos weren't banned until 78 and 77, respectively.  This is just a few differences I can think of off the op of my head.  Homes built today are better in virtually every possible way.

More importantly, is the difference in size.  [The average size of new homes built in the United States grew 62 percent from 1,660 square feet in 1973 to 2,687 square feet in 2015, an increase of 1,027 square feet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.](https://www.newhomesource.com/guide/articles/how-much-square-footage-fits-your-family)

Now, when people are buying a home they're typically less concerned with the price and the total cost of ownership, and more concerned with their mortgage payment. In 1975, the average 30 year mortgage had a 9.05% interest rate, compared with 3.85% in 2015. Assuming a 20% down payment for the above homes, it's $1354/month in 1975 vs $1013/month in 2015.  Total mortgage cost (down payment aside) would then be $487,456.16 in 1975 vs $364,815.31 in 2015. Of course, there's a lot of different types of loans, and I'm sure there are tons more borrowers today, likely with lower down payments

So yes, houses today are more expensive if you look at the price and nothing else.  Mortgage payments and total cost of ownership are massively cheaper and they're better in virtually every way, especially in that they're 62% bigger.  It's almost laughable how much better of a deal houses are today.

**Cars**

Anecdotally, when I think of older cars, I think of dangerous steel death traps and unreliable pieces of junk that will barely make it past 50,000 miles.  The only big thing I'd like to bring up is that [cars today will last about twice as long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_longevity).  However, car loans show us something similar as mortgages.  [In 1971, the average car loan carried 11.5% interest and had a term of 35 months](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1986/04/13/the-day-of-the-7-year-car-loan/0477c679-161b-49ae-acf9-4f2246a5bc3d/).  [In 2015, the average loan carried something between 4.4-5.4% and was for 67 months](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/06/01/new-car-loans-term-length/28303991/). Ballpark monthly payments there are $560/month in 1975 vs $536 in 2015.  Total loan cost was $19,592 in 1975 vs $35,882 in 2015.  Again, I'm sure the down payment size and number of borrowers is very different.  Given that you'd have to be buying a car twice as often, I'll call this a tossup.

**Education**

[We've nearly tripled the rate of college graduates since the 70s](https://www.statista.com/statistics/184272/educational-attainment-of-college-diploma-or-higher-by-gender/). That's not really meaningful here, I just wanted to bring it up. Anecdotally, it's increasingly necessary to be specialized in an increasingly complex world, which is probably one of the biggest drivers for this.  My gut feeling was that in the 1970s people tended to study more pragmatic things that would lead to high paying careers compared with today, thus higher demand and higher prices.  [That ended up being completely wrong](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2014/05/17/saturday-stat-college-majors-1970-to-today/).  While there's plenty more people studying liberals arts/humanities today, it pales in comparison to the number of people studying social sciences/history, education, and English/literature in the 1970s.  Again, anecdotally (I""m sure there's some good data and objective measures for this), people majoring in STEM+business+medicine have a higher earning potential and the degree serves as a barrier to entry.  So to me, it seems like we have way more pragmatic people today, and my initial reaction was that the more recent generations are getting shafted.  While that seems to be try at a high level, per another comment in this thread, the confounding factor is where people study and what they're paying for loans.  [For non-profit schools, tuition increases have been largely flat, though still increasing](https://i.imgur.com/e0OOLgH.png).  Most of this new cost is from the explosion of for-profit universities.

**Consumer Goods/Other**

I won't get into too much here.  But there's two things I'd like to point out as key differences.

To live in the modern world, you need modern technology that didn't come with the same cost of living in the 70s.  I'd argue internet access and smartphone service is necessary to live today.  These cost thousands of dollars per year and I can't think of anything in the 70s that's similar.  

Federal tax rate in the 70s was way higher maybe. Property taxes have been fairly flat.

In general, things have not changed THAT much, but there have been a few shifts.  Like income disparity has increased.  Low education jobs are worth less, high education jobs are worth more.

My speculation is that the combination of some of these effects lead to the perception that life is currently more economically difficult. 

For example, in the old days, an uneducated low income person could definitely buy more than they can now.  However, nowadays, a highly educated, high income person can buy more than they used to as well.  Young people feel life is more difficult because they ""have to"" get a college degree.  Once they do, though, they also will make more than a person in the past with a college degree.",cowvin2,,dtodzn,f6yit9y

My mother worked full-time as a teacher, taking a year off for each of two babies, and my dad worked full-time as an accountant. They owned their home by the time they retired, each with full pensions, but a mortgage, and raising two kids, meant they always had to be careful with their money.

My wife and I each work 50+ hours a week in highly specialized technical fields, and earn low six figures as a result, but we were both paying off our educations until roughly age thirty.

The articles you've linked seem to discuss completely different topics in the United States, while the quote you've cited is from a New Zealand MP. I'm going to assume you're asking, specifically, if there are political differences between millenials and boomers in New Zealand. To answer that question, yes, age is a significant factor in political affiliation.

> Age was negatively associated with intending to vote for the Green Party (b=-1.342, se=.196, OR=.261, z=-6.838, p<.001), showing that Green voters tend to be younger than National Party supporters. Age was also positively associated with intending to vote for NZ First (b=1.361, se=.299, OR=3.899, z=4.550, p<.001), suggesting that NZ First voters tend to be older than National Party supporters.  

[Source](https://www.psychology.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/Voter-Sentiment-Demographics-and-Psychological-Correlates-private-1.pdf)

Since the Green Party is not popular in all countries, and the NZ First party is not popular anywhere outside of New Zealand (citation needed???), this data is not applicable in a global sense.

>Moments after President Trump ended his phone call with Ukraine’s president on July 25, an unsettled national security aide rushed to the office of White House lawyer John Eisenberg.

>Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine adviser at the White House, had been listening to the call and was disturbed by the pressure Trump had applied to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rivals, according to people familiar with Vindman’s testimony to lawmakers this week.

>Vindman told Eisenberg, the White House’s legal adviser on national security issues, that what the president did was wrong, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.

>Scribbling notes on a yellow legal pad, Eisenberg proposed a step that other officials have said is at odds with long-standing White House protocol: moving a transcript of the call to a highly classified server and restricting access to it, according to two people familiar with Vindman’s account.

A practice that seems have to occurred on several calls including those with Russia and Saudi Arabia.

>The access restrictions placed on the calls with Mr. Putin of Russia and the Saudi royal family were first reported Friday night by CNN.

>The practice began after details of Mr. Trump’s Oval Office discussion with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, leaked to the news media, leading to questions of whether the president had released classified information, according to multiple current and former officials. The White House was particularly upset when the news media reported that Mr. Trump had called James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, a “nut job” during that same meeting, according to current and former officials.

Mr Vindman’s testified that the partial transcript was missing information 


>The White House lawyer later directed the transcript’s removal to a system known as NICE, for NSC Intelligence Collaboration Environment, which is normally reserved for code-word-level ­intelligence programs and top-secret sources and methods, according to an administration official.

>Former Trump national security officials said it was unheard of to store presidential calls with foreign leaders on the NICE system but that Eisenberg had moved at least one other transcript of a Trump phone call there.

>On Sept. 25, under mounting political pressure, the White House released the rough transcript of the Zelensky call. Trump has declared it a “perfect call” and proof that he has not done anything wrong.

>In his testimony, Vindman recalled that on the call, Zelensky raised Burisma by name in response to Trump’s request that the Ukrainians look into the Bidens — a detail not included in the transcript released by the White House.

If the proposal is just blowing up the Fed completely and not doing anything to deal with its central role in processing all major transactions in the economy... that would be bad.

So, on to monetary policy.  Abolishing the Fed does not abolish the government's role in monetary policy, much to the disappointment of libertarians everywhere.  It just makes monetary policy a function of the political branches of government, as opposed to an independent agency.

Historically, the way this was done was by [Congress defining the value of gold and silver coins.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41887.pdf) As that piece notes, originally there was a ratio of 15:1 of silver to gold, also set by Congress.

It turns out however that Congress setting a ratio of silver to gold was not effective at actually controlling market rates for desire of silver relative to gold.  As such, when the official rate and the market rate diverged (always), either silver or gold would dominate in coinage and the other would be neglected.  Per [Gresham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law) people used the metal for transacting which was relatively undervalued, and would not use coins from the metal which was overvalued.  It was kind of an unstable mess.

Thinking more to the modern era, if the US were to adopt a commodity standard, it would immediately have the issue that global prices [can fluctuate wildly](https://bvai.de/fileadmin/PDFs/DE/Alternative_Investments/Studien/Rohstoffe/Prokopczuk__Marcel__Wese_Simen__Chardin_Variance_Risk_Premia_in_Commodity_Markets.pdf) and cause unexpected inflation or deflation.  

Deflation is a particular danger because it can have effects of a debt-deflation spiral, as [classically explained by Irving Fisher.](https://phare.univ-paris1.fr/fileadmin/PHARE/Irving_Fisher_1933.pdf)

Essentially, the way debt deflation works is like this:

Say you own a factory that makes chairs.  You use $10 of labor and $10 of materials to produce a chair that you sell for $30 wholesale.  Therefore, your profit per chair is $10.  You make 100,000 chairs a year, and turn an annual gross profit of $1 million.

However, your factory is expensive to set up, and you took a mortgage for it and some loans for the equipment.  Your annual payment on the loans is $800,000.  So your factory turns a net profit of $200,000 per year.

Let's say there is then a 30% deflation, so all prices drop by 30%.  Your chairs now cost $14 to produce, and sell for $21 each.  If you still sell 100,000 chairs, you now make $700,000 in gross profit a year.  _However_ your debt is still there and has not gone down with other deflation.  You are now running a net loss of $100,000 a year even though proportionately nothing changed.  The fact that debt stays the same when prices fall means that households and businesses will face escalating debts when there is deflation.  This can cause businesses to close even if they should otherwise be profitable, causing more depression and deflation and a downward economic spiral.

So a system which is prone to deflationary shocks is quite bad.  And quite likely under commodity money.

Actions taken by the president can force the hand of the Fed to take specific, predictable actions in order to stimulate the economy

This is a very specific and clear example of executive influence over the Fed, but it illustrates a bigger problem, which is the moral hazard that a central bank creates as a backstop for executive mismanagement. Never mind private sector issues--do central banks encourage bad economic policy by acting as a safety net when other factors influence the economy?

And then, bringing this back to OP's question: how can we identify when bad fiscal, trade, or economic policy has precipitated monetary policy which appears to be bad, but only occurred because of factors taken up by lawmakers?

,"If you want an Anti-Fed view I highly suggest reading ""What had government done to our money"" by economist Murray Rothbard. He speaks about the federal reserve and Fiat currency in general. 

To briefly summarize some of his points from the context of the US/fed (though these points apply in general across all countries). 

Currency in general is very valuable and useful. Without currency, if you had eggs, and needed lumber, you would need to find someone who had lumber and needed eggs, or some sort of broker service. The same would be required for all transactions. This model has the obvious downside that trade is very difficult and it makes specialization nearly impossible. 

Currency allows you to trade your eggs with someone who wants them, get the currency, and then trade that currency for lumber. Then the lumberjack can use it to buy whatever they want. 

For this reason currency is very important. The  characteristics of a Currency are durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. 
Gold and silver are 2 currencies that naturally developed that fit these needs. 

They naturally developed in the sense that no governing body uniformly declared them as currency, many people chose to accept them because they were desired for their looks, and later they were desired because people knew they could be re-sold. 

The value of currency is that you can trade it for goods and services. A dollar bill, a pound Sterling, or a yen has no real utility if it can't be traded for a good or service.  So once there is enough currency in circulation to allow trade, additional currency doesn't benefit society as a whole, what matters is what goods and services your currency can buy you.

Having additional currency printed through a central body, that can ""print"" (or create digitally) an arbitrary amount can lead to problems. 

When more currency is printed, then there is now a greater supply of currency, but the same supply of goods and services. This means that the amount of goods and services that each unit of currency will buy is decreased. This is essentially what inflation is. Inflation doesn't immediately happen when currency is printed, it happens over time as the new currency is spent in the world. This is good for the people who get the new currency, and also the people who those people initially spend the money on. It is bad for everyone outside of that group. 

While printing new money and loaning it out at rates that are below market rate does encourage investment, blindly encouraging investment is not necessarily good. 

This is essentially taking money out of the pockets of consumers and putting it in the pockets of investors. Investors that would not have been able to get investments in a truly free market. This will lead to many investments that are not worth the resources they take, and leads to an inefficient use of resources. This also leads to the boom/bust cycle that is common in our economy. 

The fed prints money, it's loaned to investors at low rates, the investors are incentivized to make investments that they couldn't in a free market, and eventually many of the investments fail.

,"In addition to what others have said, it should be noted that ""from a constitutional/legal perspective"" is something different here from most other areas. Usually this phrase means interpreting many laws and precedents and regulations, and how these might be applied and enforced against the offending person/department/etc. by outside agencies/organizations (e.g. if a government agency/department doesn't enforce the law like it should, there are ways to try to force them to do so, or if they do something that's contrary to the law/constitution then there's a method for appeal). 

The US constitution gives the house ""the sole power of Impeachment"" (Article I, Section 2, Clause 5) and the senate ""the sole power to try all impeachments"" (Article I, Section 3, Clause 6). There is no outside organization that can force them to impeach someone who should be impeached and no way to appeal the senate's decision. Also, pardons can't be applied to impeachments (Article II, Section 2).

If over half of the house and two thirds of the senate want to remove the president from office because they don't like the color of the shirt he's wearing today, they could do that.

If a president is murdering babies daily on live TV and the house and senate don't want to remove him from office, nothing can force them to impeach him. 

So the discussion of precedents and laws and the constitution is interesting and can be informative as to how congress might proceed, it doesn't tell us how they *must* proceed in the way you might expect from the way we discuss those issues in other contexts.",wdn,,dqoxvb,f6d3v0c
,"This is hardly a thorough answer, and I invite others to expand on all of your questions because they are going to be very relevant in the coming weeks.

> Are there any legal or regulatory reasons why a whistleblower must identify themselves?

Explicitly no, in fact legally the whistleblower is guaranteed this exact protection

(Agency Watchdogs) “shall not, after receipt of a complaint or information from an employee, disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the inspector general determines such disclosure is unavoidable”

,"No *Reynolds v. Sims*?  

In my humble opinion, this case in particular has caused great harm to the American Republic, and has gone a long ways into provoking animosity at the State and National Levels.

The framers of the US Constitution realized that State representation needed balance between big States and small ones, and was smart enough to build the Senate (even representation) and House (proportional representation) to separate powers and provide checks and balances.  This separation of powers coming from Montesquieu who saw what happened in pre-Revolutionary France.

Reynolds v. Sims effectively made it impossible for States to bridge their rural/urban divides along long-standing county lines.  In an ideal state, the counties would be represented by 2 Senators, and apportioned by population for the Lower House.  Instead, both Upper and Lower Houses are proportioned by population.

This ends up meaning in both hard-core RED and BLUE states that urban centers end up dictating a lot of State policy, creating animosity between cities and the surrounding areas.  

If we didn't have Harold v. Sims, state politics would be less one-sided, and would allow some level of competition across the rural-urban divide to achieve an agenda.  If the Democrats wanted to push a platform, they would need to make it applicable to the rural population and urban population at large.

It's a real tragedy honestly, rooted mainly in a poor decision by a 1960s activist court.  It's made the nation a lot worse off, and should another civil war happen, be one of the root causes.

-----------------------------------------------------

**Now for my question:** Do you feel that Reynolds V. Sims was a decision marred by a unilateral focus in civil rights?  It's my impression the Court was very myopic in deciding this on the humorous assumption that one man = one vote.  Do you also feel there was a way for this decision to maintain a separation of powers?  Perhaps ensuring more equal proportional representation in the lower house, but also ensuring the upper house couldn't restructure itself once set?",AdwokatDiabel,,dosecf,f5qhsqe
,"So there are two different claims from the White House in respect to Kupperman's possible testimony: absolute immunity and executive privilege.

**Absolute Immunity**

The [suit filed by Kupperman](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kupperman.complaint.pdf)  says that the White House has asserted absolute immunity from Congressional subpoenas for White House aides.  This would be something the White House has asserted before, and which [the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel recently authored an opinion supporting.](https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1183271/download)

Absolute immunity would mean that Kupperman does not have to appear to testify at all and can ignore the subpoena in its entirety.

It is however not a theory which has found great support in the courts.  While no appeals court has ever directly ruled on the question, the US District Court for the District of Columbia [did rule on it](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv0409-49) in respect to George W. Bush's White House Counsel Harriet Miers.  

In that opinion, the court said:

>The Executive’s current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law. 

Because it is a trial court opinion, it is not a binding precedent that other judges must follow in future cases. [But it may be cited as a persuasive authority.](https://libguides.law.ucla.edu/c.php?g=686105&p=5160745)

If the _Miers_ precedent holds up, he would need to show up.

**Executive Privilege**

[Executive privilege](https://www.lawfareblog.com/primer-executive-privilege-and-executive-branch-approach-congressional-oversight) is a narrower class of immunity than absolute immunity.  It would only apply to certain categories of information, and therefore would not immunize Kupperman from appearing before the committee at all.  

Executive privilege would, if not overcome, in general protect at least conversations between Kupperman and the President.  A broader reading favored by the government would also encompass communications among senior advisers but not including the President.

However, executive privilege is not absolute.  It is in the first instance unclear if it applies at all in the impeachment context.  In a context of a grand jury proceeding [it was found to be overcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Nixon) by the needs of a criminal inquiry.  If an impeachment inquiry has similar standing to a grand jury [as the DC circuit held the other day,](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016e-046a-d3de-a7ee-edfabc550002) then executive privilege may not apply at all.

Executive privilege would also only apply to some categories of questions.  So for example one issue in the [whistleblower complaint](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20190812_-_whistleblower_complaint_unclass.pdf) was whether call transcripts were improperly put in a top secret / compartmentalized information system.  Asking whether Kupperman did that or knew that was done would not be asking about his communications with other executive branch officials and therefore not be plausibly in the scope of executive privilege.  That sort of thing is why executive privilege would not get him out of appearing entirely.",huadpe,,dojexi,f5pnmlw

,"Accusations of inaction are not credible. Canada has had departments dedicated to addressing indigenous issues since the country's formation. The budget for this department and the programs it delivers is in the billions.

* Between 1950 and 2012, per capita government funding for First Nations increased from $922 to  $9,056 (adjusted for inflation). That 882 per cent per capita increase compares with a 387 per cent increase in federal funding in that period for non-native Canadians.  [https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/facts-about-aboriginal-funding-canada](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/facts-about-aboriginal-funding-canada)
* In 2018, the federal government earmarked $16.7 billion over seven years in funding for new First Nations programs, including child welfare and clean water.  The federal government now spends $1.1 billion a year on First Nation child welfare services.  [https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/federal-budget-2018-indigenous-file-1.4552955](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/federal-budget-2018-indigenous-file-1.4552955)
* This is in addition to the standard education and health services delivered by provincial governments and available to indigenous Canadians. Canada spends more per student on education for indigenous Canadians than it does on non-indigenous students: $13,524 per student compared to $11,646 (as of 2011).   [https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/facts-about-aboriginal-funding-canada](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/facts-about-aboriginal-funding-canada).
* Post-secondary education is heavily subsidized, and basically free for children who grow up in Nunavut and the NWT. It includes living allowances of up to $1,600 a month.

And yet indigenous communities suffer from many chronic problems, including low rates of education, high rates of chronic health problems and suicide, and low incomes. These problems are chronic for the same reason many problems are chronic: they're extremely difficult to address and intractable in their nature.

The difficulties with providing infrastructure and services to First Nations include:

* Geographic isolation and extremely small communities makes delivery of even basic services staggeringly costly. Since most materials and skills are lacking in the communities, they need to be brought in from vast distances, often by plane. The cost to simply fly in a plumber in to fix a hot water tank in a home in a First Nation in North Canada is upwards of $10k. (see flight prices here:  [https://www.expedia.ca/Cheap-Flights-To-Resolute.d4060.Travel-Guide-Flights](https://www.expedia.ca/Cheap-Flights-To-Resolute.d4060.Travel-Guide-Flights) )
* The same isolation makes it very unattractive for service providers such as doctors, nurses, police, and teachers to live in these locations. Not only do they have to be paid more, they rarely stay longer than a year or two.
* And these isolated communities typically have few economic opportunities. The local industries are typically resource-based, like logging, oil and gas, and mining. Despite economic partnerships, land claims deals, and regulations mandating that companies must high indigenous employees, the people in the local communities often lack relevant skills, or a cultural norm of working long hours full-time.

As for financial mismanagement, these small (typically under 1,000) communities often lack the expertise and training to manage what are essentially municipal affairs. The political culture is also very contentious. Typically, two families or extended kin groups compete for band leadership, and award positions and contracts to supporters while withholding them from rivals. This leads to inefficiency and corruption (source: I was a journalist in a Northern community for several years).

The lack of private home ownership on most First Nations leads to the tragedy of the commons, where public housing is not kept up and rapidly degrades in quality. There's little economic incentive, and often a lack of necessary skills, to properly maintain homes in harsh environments.

Canada has treaty obligations to its First Nations, that include health care, housing, and education. However, given the extraordinary cost of delivery those services, and the poor economic status of those communities, it's doubtful if even relentlessly increased funding can ever meet the needs.  And it's worth pointing out that isolated, rural, non-indigenous communities in Canada face many of the same chronic problems.  The solution we've presented to young people in those communities: move.  I know assimilation has a bad name and a bad history, but I have a difficult time imagining how tiny, isolated First Nations communities 40 years from now will be anything but poor relative to the rest of the country.",Haffrung,,dmadbm,f51m9va

,"[SCIFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility) are common enough when discussing possible sensitive and classified information. 

Some recent publicized examples:

Trump had one made during a meeting in [Trump Towers](https://abcnews.go.com//Politics/scif-inside-room-intelligence-briefings/story?id=44607588) and another at [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/07/politics/white-house-photo-syria-briefing/index.html)

[Trey Gowdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Gowdy) who once led the house inquiry into Benghazi. Held the inquiries in the same manner as these.

Those hearings were also closed doors. In 2015 a republican house member, [Darrell Issa(R-Calif.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrell_Issa), tried to crash one of the depositions. [Gowdy had him escorted out.](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/Rep-Darrell-Issa-Escorted-Out-of-Benghazi-Panel-307739641.html)

When asked about it, Gowdy said, 

>""I'm a prosecutor, we always follow the rules, [Issa] is not a [Benghazi] committee member and non-committee members are not allowed in the room during the deposition. Those are the rules and we have to follow them, no exceptions made.""

He didn't want to turn the inquiries into a circus as well as preserve the integrity of the investigation and depositions and prevent it from being drawn out too long.

This is just one of many instances of SCIFs and closed-door hearings done in congressional inquiries. At this point it's only an investigation, not a trial. Hence ""inquiry."" Similar to how police interview witnesses. It's not done in public. 

However, as far as I know there is no law about violating the integrity of a SCIF in and of itself, however the manner in which it is violated may fall under some other unrelated laws.",I_am_The_Teapot,,dm4cik,f4xjbuu

>The standard reply to an inquiry regarding bringing a commercial cellular device into a classified space is ""No, but …"" As in all things wireless, we turn for overarching guidance to DoD Directive 8100.02: Use of Commercial Wireless Devices, Services and Technologies in the DoD Global Information Grid. The relevant sections state: 

>4.2. Cellular/PCS and/or other RF or Infrared (IR) wireless devices shall not be allowed into an area where classified information is discussed or processed without written approval from the DAA in consultation with the Cognizant Security Authority (CSA) Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority (CTTA). 

>4.3. Wireless technologies/devices used for storing, processing and/or transmitting information shall not be operated in areas where classified information is electronically stored, processed or transmitted unless approved by the DAA in consultation with the CSA CTTA. The responsible CTTA shall evaluate the equipment using risk management principles and determine the appropriate minimum separation distances and countermeasures. 

>Therefore, while the presumptive answer is ""no,"" if there is a bona fide mission requirement, there may well be a way to get your BlackBerry into that restricted space — but you have to convince your local security authority and the DAA first. Their risk management evaluation will weigh the benefits of such approval against the security risks inherent in the scenario of cellular devices in an area where there is also classified information. 

>Risky Business 

>You may ask, ""How risky can it be? After all, I use this device everyday and have never had a problem."" The answer is that it can be very risky indeed, to the point that you could potentially be the source of a compromise of classified information and would never even know it. To gain an appreciation of the risk, go to your favorite Internet search engine and search for ""cellular vulnerabilities"" or a similar phrase. The results may surprise you. 

>Although we refer to them as mobile ""phones,"" any cellular device is actually a mobile radio, one that receives and transmits just like any other radio. Further, they do a fair amount of transmitting and receiving on their own outside of your oversight or control. Cellular networks operate on two distinct sets of channels — the traffic channel where your calls and data sessions are conducted, and the control channel, which handles network maintenance, operational tasks and text messages. (See: ""Putting Text to the Test."") 

>Some of the tasks that are conducted over the control channel include the phone letting the cellular network know where it is (and, by extension, where you are), call set-up and initiation. The control channel can also put the phone in diagnostic mode, which includes turning on the microphone. This, in a nutshell, is the primary reason that cellular devices are not allowed in classified spaces. 

>Using the control channel, an adversary or run-of-the-mill hacker could turn on the microphone — without any visible change in the phone's appearance — and freely listen in. Thus, you have just brought a bug into an area where classified information is now being transmitted into the ether. Not a pleasant scenario. 

>In addition to the inherent cellular vulnerabilities, all electronic equipment is capable of emitting electronic emanations. This is where TEMPEST (Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Emanation Standard) practices come into play. TEMPEST refers to the shielding of these electromagnetic emanations, which is different from the actual interception of these emissions. 

>Due to the vulnerabilities associated with electronic equipment in general, it is mandated that the CTTA play a role in accepting the use of these devices in classified spaces.

>And who might foreign adversaries target to get such information? Why lawmakers, of course.

>“Members of Congress (and their electronic devices) are high-value targets for compromise by foreign intelligence services,” Eoyang continued. “Members of Congress have access to a wide range of sensitive information, including, in the case of these members, conversations with the President of the United States” and “tend to be lax in their security protocols.”",Adama0001,,dm4cik,f4xcrfb

Today, Bloomberg news [reported the following:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/poll-finds-highest-support-for-inquiry-yet-impeachment-update)

>Trump had advance knowledge and supported a protest by Republicans who told him they planned to barge into a secure hearing room on Capitol Hill where Democrats are holding impeachment testimonies, according to four people familiar with the matter.

>Trump on Tuesday met with about 30 House Republicans at the White House to talk about the situation in Syria and the impeachment inquiry. During a nearly two-hour meeting, which focused mostly on the impeachment inquiry, lawmakers shared their plans to storm into the secure room, the people said. Trump supported the action, saying he wanted the transcripts released because they will exonerate him, the people said.

This very neatly meets the elements [of a conspiracy in federal law,](https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-2167-jury-instruction-conspiracy-18-usc-1956h) so if the underlying conduct is a crime, Trump could be guilty of that crime as a conspirator, even if the other conspirators enjoy immunity.

I think it is very plausible to read what happened today as a violation of [18 USC sec. 1505,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) *Obstruction of proceedings before departments, agencies, and committees*

>Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress—

,"It's remarkable to me how much credence people put in the idea that the Russian's social media propaganda efforts have any significant influence on our elections.  Don't get me wrong, I have no doubt they want and try to influence public opinion, but I think people way overestimate the effect it could possibly have and it just comes across as paranoid conspiracy fodder.

Think about it, these candidates are [literally spending billions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States) of dollars over the course of the election cycle to influence voters.  Let's just say the Russians are setting up twitter bots, etc.  So what?  The candidates *themselves* are all over social media spreading their message too.  But not only that, the candidates and their surrogates are all over the news making their cases on the issues of the day.  They periodically publicly debate on the national stage in front of millions of viewers who are tuning in expressly to hear what they have to say to help them make up their mind about who they want to support.  They are traveling the country giving speeches in front of huge crowds.  They do all this and yet sometimes can't even budge the polls in their favor by a single percentage point.

Not only that but think about all the stuff that happens that influences people's votes that couldn't possibly be the doings of the Russians.  Did the Russians force Hillary to use a private email server for her State Dept. email?  Did the Russians force Trump to do the ""grab them by the pussy"" interview years ago?  Did the Russians cause Hillary to collapse at the 9/11 memorial service 2 months before election day? Did the Russians force Trump to make the comment about all Mexicans being rapists (and all the other outrageous things he said and did during the campaign)?  Did the Russians force Hillary to make the ""basket of deplorables"" statement?

I'm sorry these are the types of things that drive an election.  In this day and age where everybody has access to tons of real news and information about the candidates, do you really think that people are being swayed in any significant way by what a few anonymous nobodies on twitter have to say?   Further, the internet is full of all kinds of *american* trolls with various agendas.  What makes you think that the addition of a few Russian trolls is going be anything other than noise in the big picture of things?

All that said, I do think that the [cyber attacks on the DNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak) is disturbing and is a clear example of significant Russian meddling.  But I question if that is really even propaganda.  Yes, it made Hillary and democrats look bad and could have suppressed voter turnout.  But in the end it was not a lie.  If a non-foreign entity had been responsible, it could arguably be called a positive act that exposed an important truth.  Certainly if the roles were reversed and a it made Republicans look bad, I am guessing there would be a good number of people on the left who would be making that exact argument.  But I do agree that since it was a foreign entity, we should make all efforts to prevent that sort of thing happening again.

,"You don't *need* the hypothesis of Russian support in order to explain why there would be a second candidate in the presidential race who's so favorable to the Kremlin's interests.

There is small but vigorous fringe on the American left that reacted with skepticism to the revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and subsequent inquiries into the Trump campaign's degree of complicity. It helps to remember that, back then, there was a major conflict on the left about how to balance outrage at the DNC for [carrying out a biased primary season in favor of Hillary Clinton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/24/here-are-the-latest-most-damaging-things-in-the-dncs-leaked-emails/) versus outrage at Russia for [releasing this information in order to hurt Clinton's candidacy and help Trump's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Report_On_The_Investigation_Into_Russian_Interference_In_The_2016_Presidential_Election.pdf). The general theme of Russiagate skeptics on the left is the latter scandal was emphasized and investigated with an ulterior motive of exonerating Clinton from responsibility in her eventual election defeat, which many on the left feel strongly was mainly her own fault. Even more generally, they tend to argue that investigation of the attack on American democracy is a distraction from the continued problems within the centrist Democratic establishment post-Clinton.

One of the most prominent Russiagate skeptics on the left is the Intercept co-editor Glenn Greenwald, who wrote many pieces challenging or minimizing the findings of journalists and the Mueller probe as the inquiry chugged along, and called for getting along with the Russian government rather than demonizing it for its attack against the US (detailed profiles [here](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/glenn-greenwald-russia-investigation.html) and [here](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/03/glenn-greenwald-the-bane-of-their-resistance)). (If you recall the NSA leaks from Reality Winner about Russia's election interference in 2017, [she actually sent those to The Intercept less than a week after Greenwald said there was no evidence of Russian involvement](https://abcnews.go.com/US/leaking-secret-nsa-report-russia-unfolded/story?id=47858751).) Another leader among leftist Russiagate skeptics is the Rolling Stone journalist Matt Taibbi, who argues that the centrists' focus on the Russian attack resulted from their blindness toward the real issues in the country that led people to support Trump ([example](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/taibbi-trump-russia-mueller-investigation-815060/)). A third is the independent journalist Aaron Maté, who said that the amount of concern and outrage in reaction to the Russian attack was a bigger scandal than the attack itself ([example](https://www.thenation.com/article/russiagate-trump-mueller-report-no-collusion/)) and is now challenging the impeachment inquiry into the Ukraine scandal as well ([example](https://www.thenation.com/article/ukrainegate-biden-trump/)). Although these men take points of view that make them strange bedfellows with the opposite political fringe (even the ""no collusion"" defense features prominently in their arguments), their credentials as leftists and disagreement with Donald Trump's policies are not in question. Their resistance to ""Russophobia"" may align well with Russia's interests but I don't think anyone has credibly accused them of actually being supported by Russia.

The GRU indictment is solid evidence based on thorough surveillance. Everything Fancy Bear did was documented by the Mueller team and nothing was left out. The name Clinton is stated explicitly 30 times in the GRU indictment. The names Gabbard, Stein and Sanders occur zero times.

This is what EVIDENCE looks like. The Mueller team had access to every detail. To paraphrase from the Mueller Report If Mueller had meant to say ""Gabbard, Stein and Sanders"" that is exactly what he would have said. He did not. He said Clinton.

Robert Mueller was chosen to conduct a politically explosive investigation because he was the most respected prosecutor in the Justice Department and above reproach. He had carte blanche in choosing his team and he selected the best investigators and prosecutors in Washington. Their investigation was thorough and comprehensive. Any allegation that the reports or indictments are inaccurate or hide any evidence is false. The accusations against Tulsi Gabbard, Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders are as false and misleading as Q-Anon, PizzaGate or the guys who steal your kidneys and leave you in a bathtub with a note.",CommanderMcBragg,,djz6u7,f4bcn7y
,"VAT taxes are widely regarded as very efficient taxes, meaning the damage to the economy is minimal. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp 
However, the downside is that VAT taxes are regressive, as a flat increase in the price of goods affects the poor the hardest as they spend a higher percentage of their income on goods.
A wealth tax can be made as progressive as wanted, due to the ability of the government to set the values of the tax. The downside is it heavily affects the economy, due to facts mentioned in the other comments.
In the end, all that matters is how progressive the tax system overall is, not any specific tax. For instance, a government funded entirely by a VAT tax could still be progressive if there is a strong welfare state that counteracts the effect.",palaray,,dj5xyp,f41v68w

Greg leans conservative, but he is well versed in all economic models, and he is generally a well respected authority in Economics, has government experience, and is currently a professor at Harvard.

A large issue with a wealth tax is the revenue projections are much lower compared to Yang's VAT, but would also cost far more to administrate and police. In 1990, Europe had 12 countries with a wealth tax. Today only 3 do and as far as I know they are poorly enforced (enforcement needs citation here, so take that with a grain of salt). They all moved to a VAT because they found it was far better at capturing revenue. The only kind of fraud it can experience is carousel fraud, which is relatively rare and not seen on a mass scale. 

Greg covers much of this in his analysis.

,"**Wealth tax pros:**

* It is progressive (wealthy people pay more).

* It will lead to a lot of revenue in the short run.

* Could potentially increase EPS for publicly traded companies (which are primarily owned by pension and retirement accounts).

**Wealth tax cons:** 

* It is very distortionary. Historically similar policies have lead to flights of wealth from the country. Additionally individuals will have incentive to never take new companies public, take public companies private, and move wealth from public companies to private ones. The reason being that it is really hard to measure the value of a private company (where as with a public one i can do the share price * the number of shares, kind of). This will enable the very wealthy to hide $ in these companies

* It will reduce capital gains tax revenue in the long run. Generally the very wealthy reinvest most of their money when they earn it. This reinvestment will lead to future capital gains that will be taxed.

* It will reduce access to capital for US companies (one of the ways you get money is by issuing new stock, a wealth tax will reduce the price of each share).

* It will reduce philanthropic efforts by many billionaires (tons of billionaires are super philanthropic. Whether they do it b/c they want a building named after them or because they are selfless doesn't matter, as the end result is the same).

**VAT pros:**

* Less distortionary

* Tons of examples of successful VAT implementations

* (more controversial) Has the potential to allow us to redirect behavior by tweaking how the VAT is applied (we up the VAT on sugar and corn sugars to reduce obesity...)

**VAT cons:**

* It is regressive. Generally an individuals marginal propensity to consume decreases as they earn more money.  A VAT will tax individuals proportional to their marginal propensity to consume. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalpropensitytoconsume.asp

A lot of essential products will be exempt from the VAT, such as food, clothing, childcare and sanitary products.

100% of the VAT revenue is to be injected into his UBI plan, among other sources of revenue, which puts the VAT into progressive taxation territory due to [low-income groups paying less into VAT](https://flowingdata.com/2018/02/08/how-different-income-groups-spend-money/) (few, less-expensive purchases) and the wealthy putting significantly more (many expensive purchases)

The revenue from the VAT is going directly back into the hands of the consumer.

,"There was a pretty good discussion on [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/01/699261950/why-a-wealth-tax-didnt-work-in-europe) about wealth taxes.  The gist of it is this:

Pros: Theoretically, it is supposed to reduce income inequality by taxing the value of all assets (cars, houses, jewlery, boats, etc in addition to cash, investments, etc) The idea is that it would force more money to be active in the economy instead of allowing it to be stockpiled.  Then that money could be taken by the government and redistributed to people that have much less. 


Cons:  It has been tried in many countries and hasn't achieved the desired results.  It has been since abandoned in almost all of those cases.  The problems they ran into were... 

It's very difficult and expensive to accurately assess the value of everyone's assets, depreciation, etc.  Becomes very easy for people to hide assets.  And many wealthy people chose to simply take their wealth to a different country.  

So after the dust settled, they made a nominal gain in tax revenue, and that gain was offset by administrative costs and reduced tax base. 




The VAT Tax is based on a taxpayer's *consumption* rather than income.  This is the system mostly used in Europe aftet the failure of the wealth tax.  It has its own [Pros and Cons ](https://taxfoundation.org/pros-cons-value-added-tax-vat/). 


Pros:  It encourages saving and doesn't punish people for being successful or wealthy.  It mostly affects those that live extravagant lifestyles and spend lots of money.  So it raises tax revenue mostly by charging those that benefit most from it and consume the most goods and services. 


[Cons:](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp)Critics say that while the wealthy bear most of the brunt, it disproportionately affects the poor because a higher percentage of their income is spent on consumables instead of saving or investing.  Also because it adds more expense in the process, the price of consumer goods go up. In 2010, they did a study of the implementation of a VAT tax in the US and estimated that it would reduce consumer spending by $2.5 trillion over the first 10 years and cost 850,000 jobs in the first year. (same source as above). 

There are also concerns with the cost increases of implementation and bookkeeping, as many states currently set their own sales tax and other countries can interperate the application differently, setting up a lot of legal battles. 



For reference, both of these strategies vary from the current system in the US of income taxes (on new income instead of wealth accrued) and federal sales tax, which doesn't differ greatly from the VAT.  The difference being that with the current sales tax, the taxes are paid only at the point of sale while the VAT assesses smaller taxes at each stage of value add, paid by the businesses performing the value add, then a smaller tax at the point of sale.  In both cases, the cost of the taxes is passed on to the consumer.  So they don't vary greatly in *principle*, they are just executed differently.",B0h1c4,,dj5xyp,f42fffw
,"The general issue with VAT is that it is usually regressive. When applied to goods that most people have to buy (e.g. food, clothes), people with less money end up spending a larger proportion of their income on the items and therefore the tax. 

There are tax credit schemes that can be implemented to help mitigate this but I can't claim to fully understand how they work except to say that lower income brackets get some of the VAT back in the form of a credit, reducing their burden.

It's not an insignificant amount of wealth, but how do you value it? Do you have to project sales on what the song might earn you in the future? What if that projection is wrong? Is it worth what a record company might pay for it now? Does that mean that your accountant needs to get quotes for what they would purchase the rights to your song for and for the IRS agent to confirm the quotes?  


Needless to say, it would be very very complicated for both the accountant and the IRS agent to asses even this one item.

# Economists discuss the wealth tax

Since the wealth tax debate is really big in the news right now I thought I'd share a brand new (literally came out yesterday) video of a conference between some economists on this exact subject. The link is [here](https://www.piie.com/events/combating-inequality-rethinking-policies-reduce-inequality-advanced-economies), but don't watch the entire thing. The part about the wealth tax is session 6. More specifically:

1. The first speaker is Emmanuel Saez at 8:09:06. He argues in favor of a wealth tax. Importantly, he, along with Gabriel Zucman, have proposed the wealth tax that Warren's wealth tax is modeled after/inspired by.
2. The second speaker is Lawrence H. Summers at 8:24:47. He basically just spends the entire time critiqing Saez & Zucman's wealth tax as well as wealth taxes generally.
3. The final speaker is Greg Mankiw at 8:42:20. He expresses disagreements that a wealth tax can work and endorses UBI funded by some kind of flat tax (on income or on consumption like Yang) as a better alternative way to redistribute wealth. He also name drops Yang several times.",zkaiz,,dj5xyp,f45h6o3
,"**Wealth tax has several advantages:**

1) a lower tax percentage rate than income based taxes, because there is a larger base to tax.  (10.2 Trillion taxable income vs $113 Trillion in owned assets- for households alone\[couldn't find totals including businesses\])  This means the majority of people will pay less, to generate the same amount of tax-income for the government.  

 [https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/06/25/six-facts-about-wealth-in-the-united-states/](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/06/25/six-facts-about-wealth-in-the-united-states/) 

 [https://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2018-update/](https://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2018-update/) 

2) breaks dynasties / enforces merit-based wealth:  Inheritors of large amounts of wealth, that do not have the ability/skills to generate income greater than the wealth tax, will over time, lose this wealth, at least until it decreases to the point where they CAN generate income greater than the wealth tax.  

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage) 

&#x200B;

3) encourages investment or economic stimulation:  Since dollars owned will be taxed at the same rate, whether it's under your mattress or invested in the market, one is encouraged to earn more than the tax-rate on it.  When money does not come directly out of one's paycheck, and to sit in government coffers, people now have a greater fraction of their income to invest.  Alternatively, some people will choose to minimize their wealth to be taxed, by spending all their wealth, as they earn it, which will stimulate the economy from the consumer side (also see 5 under disadvantages).

 [https://www.thebalance.com/consumer-spending-definition-and-determinants-3305917](https://www.thebalance.com/consumer-spending-definition-and-determinants-3305917) 

4) Encourages tax reporting:  rather than imposing penalties for not filing, say payroll taxes, people & businesses are encouraged to report payments to others, so they won't be taxed for owning that money.

\[Couldn't find the psychology study links I was looking for here- can anyone help me out?\]

**But it also has a few disadvantages:**

1) Harder to compute somebody's ""total wealth"";  while some of it is easily computable stuff like stocks, or dollars in the bank, some of it is not so easily valued like land, cars, machinery, art, and ownership of non-publicly traded companies.  Also to be taken into account is the average wealth over the course of the whole year, rather than just the wealth at the end of the year.  

 [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp) 

2) Liquidity:  it's possible for the majority of a person's wealth-to-be-taxed is tied up on non-liquid assets, like say.. land.  Failure/inability to pay the taxes on this land would eventually lead to some kind of forclosure/seizing of some/all of the land-  a tricky issue and potentially, a lot of work for tax agencies.

 [https://www.thestreet.com/politics/what-is-a-wealth-tax-14846092](https://www.thestreet.com/politics/what-is-a-wealth-tax-14846092) 

3) Hiding:  while hiding income is also possible, the ability to hide wealth is potentially easier and more difficult for authorities to detect.  Particularly if done BEFORE the walth tax goes into effect (see #4 in advantages)

4) Taxing dollars multiple times:  every year you own a dollar, you would be taxed on it.  While this is similar to land-taxes, many people find this disturbing because they believe an owned-dollar should only be taxed once, when acquired. However, wealth-tax also ""undoes"" the multiple taxations currently applied to dividend gains (company profits are taxed, and then your share of that profit is taxed again when you acquire it as income).

So I guess he can still participate? 

All of that said I think the process of actually getting Senator Graham to comply with the subpoena would turn into a political nightmare. He would likely invoke his Fifth Amendment Right. I think that going after the the information that he has would best fit in the building legal cases via court subpoenas. Then letting the Senate handle it, deciding on if they want to expel him. But I’m no lawyer or politician so I don’t know where this train is headed!

The DNC won that lawsuit, and unless there are differences in their charter that I'm unaware of, I believe the same precedent would apply to them.

What this means is that should Trump be removed from office at any point up to the convention and actual naming of a nominee, they could do just about whatever process they can think up to name a replacement.

So, it's a bit of a split with the 1800s dropping the VP and the 1900s renominating the VP. Such a small sample size, though.

> Second, what is the party's obligation in the case of removal from office, as it relates to an upcoming election? Do they have to stage primaries and debates? 

They're going to stage primaries whether there's an incumbent or not. For instance, the Democrats held primaries in [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries) with state or local activists getting votes, even though Obama was guaranteed to win (he was unopposed in a majority of states by my count). 

Assuming that impeachment happens after primaries are started (seems likely) and Weld still manages to lose due to a ""rally around Trump"" effect (pretty likely), Trump will probably have enough delegates to be nominated at the convention. [There are ways out of that scenario that were discussed in 2016](http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/last-ditch-effort-to-block-donald-trumps-nomination/), but I'm not sure if they'd work.

,"For a holistic discussion of impeachment we must also look at the results of past impeachment efforts.

* Caveat: There is really only one real example that is comparable to a Trump impeachment, and that would be the Clinton impeachment. Discussion of the others is relevant if we can avoid anachronistic thinking.

&#x200B;

Solely in scope of Presidential impeachments there are 4 of relevance to the discussion:

1. Bill Clinton(D): There was overwhelming evidence of multiple crimes, and yet not a single Senate Democrat voted to impeach. I assert that this very relevant to how a Trump impeachment would pan out in the Senate, with all members of his party voting against, regardless of the facts.
2. Richard Nixon(R): Resigned prior to impeachment proceedings. Of note is how is successor, Ford, gave him a full unconditional pardon for all crimes committed as President. This set a precedent that Trump's successor, Pence, would likely follow as well. 
3. Andrew Johnson(D): Acquitted by 1 vote. All 9 Democrats in the Senate voted against.
4. James Buchanan(D): Also never actually impeached. A committee of 5 (the Covode Committee) found that he'd done nothing to warrant impeachment, though also noted that his administration was the most corrupt since the founding of the republic.

,"You've already gotten a direct answer (there isn't a precedent for this).

And a hypothetical one (some elevated VPs from deaths in office weren't their party's nominee at the next convention). Which suggests that Republicans could pick a different candidate (even if they don't hold primaries everywhere).

But I want to point out one other piece to keep in mind: The Electoral College.

An impeachment could theoretically occur right up to the end of a term, which could be after any convention opportunity to change nominees and could even be after the election. In such a scenario the electors (who are actually what the public votes for) would end up with the option to decide the candidate.

There have been ""faithless electors"" in the past, but, like your question, there's no precedent for this kind of scenario either. No matter what happens we're going to see a number of ""events for the history books"" over the next few years.

,"There isn't really a precedent for a VP becoming president and running for presidential election.  Not by way of impeachment anyway.

[Lyndon Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson) was elevated from VP to President when JFK was assassinated.  He ran for a second term and won.

But one thing that I think is important to remember is that presidential running mates typically aren't selected because they are the second best candidate. All of the party's eggs are usually in the basket of the president and a running mate is selected for focus group reasons.  (they appeal to certain demographics and can help boost votes).

The best example that comes to mind is [Sarah Palin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin).  We later found out that John McCain did not want her as his running mate, and he didn't even interview her for the position.  She was presented to him by the party and campaign managers.  Not because she would be the most qualified to replace him, but because as a female, she could snatch up supporters of the recently defeated Hillary Clinton, and because she was very charismatic (but extremely inexperienced).  Obama was *also* very charismatic and inexperienced, so they thought she may have the same appeal.


The point I'm making is that Pence likely isn't the guy they really want as president. If he takes office and people really rally behind him, they will be forced to support him for ""re""election. 

But otherwise (this is not fact, just my best guess) I think they would probably try to find a candidate that that best counters the democratic candidate.  It would likely be late in the race and the democrats would have already shown their full hand. If one of the socialists (Warren or Sanders) are the democratic candidate, they will likely try to find someone that can capitalize on the public's fears of ""government overreach"", fear of socialism leading to communism, etc... yet mature and respected to fill in where Trump came up short. 

In other words, I think they would push a moderate, middle of the road guy to appear reasonable and make the socialist candidates appear extreme. 


If a more moderate democratic candidate like Biden or Gabbard is selected, then I think they would do the opposite.  They would probably find a more ""far right"" guy to differentiate them from the ""more reasonable"" Democratic candidate and find someone that can capitalize on Trump's supporters. 


That's my *guess*. 

Another possibility I could see, to answer your question about the actual *process* thing, is that if they foresee a good likelihood that Trump will removed, then they begin a ""parallel"" campaign.  There is no precedent for this, so I'm totally guessing here... 


But a parallel campaign that kind of mirrors Trump.  Appeals to his same followers, capitalizes on the people that feel Trump is being railroaded, etc.  Then they have this candidate at the ready if Trump is removed, but can also bow out and defer to Trump if he is *not* removed. 


The timing makes it interesting.  It (probably intentionally) is timed to put the conservatives in a bind by having the president being actively investigated during a re-election campaign. And it definitely puts them in a bind.  They are going to have to get creative with how they respond, and like many things in this presidency, we will see a lot of ""firsts"". 


I think the battle will be for how people view the investigation into Trump.  Will they see him as a crooked politician skirting responsibility?  Or will they see him as a political target being railroaded by the opposing party?   We are going to see a *massive* amount of spin from both sides to try to control this narrative. 

If Republicans, can somehow create sympathy for Trump/Pence as a victim like they had for JFK/Johnson, then maybe Pence can get the push.  But if Democrats can  sell Trump as a villain, the Pence will go down with him.  Then the party would distance themselves and go in a different direction.

,"From [your source](https://quillette.com/2019/10/07/oikophobia-our-western-self-hatred/) the author seems to make the jump from someone saying “you shouldn’t criticize other cultures, only your own” to “hatred or dislike of ones own culture”. 

> But my fellow diner continued to insist that we should only criticize our own cultures, never others. I thus had one of my frequent meetings with the intellectually bankrupt posture of oikophobia, the hatred or dislike of one’s own cultural home.


Let’s apply this exact scenario to a very similar situation: Self criticism. 

Personally, I go out of my way to avoid criticizing others but I am very critical of myself. Does that mean that myself and all others with the same life philosophy hate themselves? No. Many people have this mindset because they think it’s unfair to criticize someone who has been through experiences they may not understand, but they are frequently taking critical and constructive looks at themselves and their past actions and learning from them. Of course, there are people who are self critical that do very much dislike themselves, but I would argue that this is not the “rule” when it comes to being self critical. Had the author of this piece been discussing self criticism at the individual level, they would be arguing that self criticism is self hatred. 

I know that my lack of sources here makes this argument pretty shaky, so what I’ll ask to anyone reading this is: have you ever been critical of yourself or your own past actions in any way? And if so, do you legitimately hate yourself? Im willing to bet that the majority of people here will say yes to the first question, but no to the second. 


Then the author goes on to say the following:

> The simplest way of defining oikophobia is as the opposite extreme of xenophobia. As xenophobia means the fear or hatred of strangers or foreigners, so oikophobia means the fear or hatred of home or one’s own society or civilization, oikos being the ancient Greek word for home, house, household. The term was coined in this sense by British philosopher Roger Scruton in 2004, in his book England and the Need for Nations. He calls oikophobia “the felt need to **denigrate** the customs, culture and institutions that are identifiably ‘ours.’” 


With this, he’s saying that it’s the need to criticize ones own culture **unfairly**, but I’m not sure how the above example, any of the other examples presented in the article, or the ones in your post are examples of **unfair** criticism. US citizens recognizing the horrific nature of slavery and the role it played in our nations history is not unfair, it’s recognizing ones own wrongdoing. Likewise, German citizens recognizing the horrific actions their nation played in WWII is not unfair, it’s also simply recognizing ones own wrongdoing. 


The rest of the essay you’ve cited seems to truly rely on the premise of criticism/recognizing ones own wrongdoing=hatred, when I think it’s safe to say that such a statement is simply untrue. Likewise, I think your examples depend on the same premises.

So, with that being said: I’m not entirely convinced that oikophobia even exists in the manner in which you or this article have discussed.

Foir example, let's consider the first essay you link to, ""‘Oikophobia’: Our Western Self-Hatred"" by Benedict Beckeld. Beckeld shows up on a [podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20190316104130/https://israelnewstalkradio.com/oikophobia-self-hatred-of-ones-own-culture-and-people-the-tamar-yonah-show-audio-%F0%9F%8E%A7/) in an interview described as:

> Sadly, many liberal elites suffer from Oikophobia, the self-loathing of their own country and people. Whether it stems from guilt or fear or an an inferiority complex, the results are racist, and deadly!

> Dr. Beckeld addresses the dangers of Oikophobia as it affects today’s liberal-progressives, regarding Islamic anti-Democratic regimes and ideologies. An important show!

&nbsp;

Elsewhere, Beckeld [writes](https://web.archive.org/web/20190825124111/http://www.benedictbeckeld.com/philosophyblog/2015/6/15/oikophobia-in-modern-and-american-history), 

> The first unquestionably oikophibic president of the United States was Jimmy Carter, and every president since then, with the possible exception of Reagan, has been oikophobic. The state of current American civilization is such that diversity has had a debilitating effect on many aspects of society, on its culture, politics, and use of its military. It is a nation so bent on internal squabbling that it is no longer capable of effectively projecting outward force. 

&nbsp;


Other ""oikophobia"" proponents include white nationalist politician, Thierry Baudet. An article on [The New Dutch Disease Is White Nationalism](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/20/the-new-dutch-disease-is-white-nationalism/) notes:

> Long before entering politics, Baudet donned the cloak of the public intellectual, penning polemics on topics including modern art and the European Union, often repeating on loop that it was all connected to oikophobia. Baudet defines this term, taken from the conservative British philosopher Roger Scruton, as a “pathological aversion” to the national home. Oikophobia, he insists, is destroying the nation-state through its concerted support for feminism, cultural Marxism, modern art, immigration, the European Union, and whatever else can be cast as the vague yet menacing bogeyman of the paranoid right.

[Also,](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/thierry-baudet-dutch-rightwing-populism)

> Baudet’s thinking might be described as a combination of the German historian Oswald Spengler and the Canadian academic Jordan Peterson. On the one hand, he sees a decline of the west – see Spengler’s 1918 book Der Untergang des Abendlandes – because he feels the political and cultural elites are willingly trading in the “old values” for an atheistic, progressive cosmopolitanism. On the other hand, he talks about the restoration of a nationalistic, masculine society, and the need to not apologise for – for example – colonialism or racist and sexists structures in society, but to straighten your back and walk tall. If you are conservative, affluent, educated, white cis-male, you’re fine. If you’re a woman or a minority, well, you’re bad.

,"The linked Times piece does not say that 1619 marks the true founding of the United states; it says the date marks the beginning of the history of slavery in the United states.

According to the linked Nike article, the reason the design was pulled was not that America has a history with slavery, but that concerns were expressed that the Betsy Ross flag had been co-opted by groups with racist ideologies.  From the link:

"" Mr. Kaepernick, who signed a lucrative deal to serve as a Nike brand ambassador last year, expressed the concern to the company that the Betsy Ross flag had been co-opted by groups espousing racist ideologies, the person said.

Sandra Carreon-John, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement on Tuesday that Nike had made the decision to “halt distribution” of the sneaker “based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation’s patriotic holiday.” The company’s initial acknowledgment of the recall hours earlier did not explain the reasoning behind the decision.""

[This Rolling Stone article](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/betsy-ross-flag-nike-colin-kaepernick-patriot-movement-ku-klux-klan-854612/) names some groups that have recently used the Betsy Ross flag.

What is stated in the final article is that white liberals are as of recently more pro-out-group, not that they are increasingly anti-in-group.

The definition of an oikophobic seems to differ from that of a [race traitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_traitor) only in that the notion of race has been replaced with the more general ""in-group"". This is not to say that oikophobia is not a real or significant phenomena, but one needs to proceed carefully and the examples of sentiments given seem to me to be the opposite of helpful for the purposes of having that discussion. They're all non-examples of the phenomenon (at least, according to the linked sources) involving famously liberal individuals or institutions.",euclid316,,dg2gkm,f3wlfhz
,"Xenophobia [is defined as](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/xenophobia):

>dislike of or prejudice *against people* from other countries.

Oikophobia has attempted to be defined as a moral antithesis of xenophobia by political conservatives, but in doing so the italicized portion is often dropped.  

Instead of being defined as:

> dislike of or prejudice against people from a person's own country

Richard Scruton and Benedict Beckeld (among others) instead use a definition that can more accurately be stated as:

> dislike of a person's own group, culture, or nation

This distinction is important because the core issue with xenophobia is the discrimination and violence towards people it presents.  Disliking the customs and culture of other nations or groups is acceptable, but committing acts of discrimination or prejudice is not.

Those pushing against 'oikophobia' aren't arguing against acts of discrimination against in-groups, but instead are trying to use a public distaste for xenophobic actions to ban or censure criticisms of policies and cultural customs.  

For example, the [Beckeld essay](https://quillette.com/2019/10/07/oikophobia-our-western-self-hatred/) clearly shows this focus on criticism rather than discrimination:

>My follow-up question, whether then by her logic a non-Austrian or non-European should not be allowed to criticize Nazism, did not receive a clear reply. But my fellow diner continued to insist that we should only criticize our own cultures, never others. I thus had one of my frequent meetings with the intellectually bankrupt posture of oikophobia, the hatred or dislike of one’s own cultural home.

These two definitions should not be considered opposites.  The public distaste for xenophobia stems from actions directed towards individuals, while these conservatives seem to focus on criticisms of groups.  For example, [a recent spree of violence ](https://www.fairplanet.org/story/south-africa%E2%80%99s-xenophobia-problems-result-of-leadership-failure/) in South Africa was linked to xenophobia.  The issue isn't that South Africans criticized foreign cultures or policies, but that ""12 people were killed in South Africa after mobs of locals went on a rampage targeting foreign-owned businesses.""

Meanwhile, Richard Scruton [described](http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/cs49-8.pdf) ""a chronic form of oikophobia [which] has spread through the American universities, in the guise of political correctness.""  It should be obvious that civil criticism of culture is not the same as xenophobic violence, and thus not demanding of the same repudiation.  If oikophobia is ""educated derision"" of ""national loyalty"", as Scruton calls it, then it is in no way the opposite extreme of xenophobia.",ManBearScientist,,dg2gkm,f3yhq6d

According to this recent report by the Congressional Research Service, an impeachment inquiry is initiated by passing a resolution calling for the removal of a Federal officer.  No such resolution has been approved by the House yet, so it’s hard to discuss the matters of the impeachment inquiry without one on record to get the information flowing.

,"I feel [Patrick Tucker's discussion over at Defense One](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/10/why-open-skies-old-fashioned-treaty-worth-keeping/160496/) does a reasonable job of explaining the problems specifically surrounding US withdrawal, both rationale for (in the article) and notable consequences of (quoted below, highlighting my own):

>It’s one reason why [Admiral Cecil] Haney remained a fan of the treaty. “While I am concerned in terms of overflights of any ability of another nation to learn more about our overall critical infrastructure, *I do have respect for said treaty in terms of the 32-some nations that are also part of that treaty, in which it* ***allows for transparency and the ability of sharing immediately that information*** *that that treaty is associated with*.”

>Perhaps the most important thing that the treaty provides is the ability of the **other countries—without fancy high-resolution intelligence satellites—to monitor Russian moves**. That, perhaps, is the main reason it’s worth keeping.",himay81,,dfxd42,f371ugj
,"Again, my background includes a graduate degree on a Russia-related topic, but not military history, so take what I have with a grain of salt. 

In the late-1980s, Glasnost and Perestroika were formidable political movements, but largely window dressing. Chernobyl is a great example of the Soviet's attempt to control the narrative and willingness to lie to not only its citizenry but allies about the full effect of the radiation. At the time, the USSR was ""reducing"" its military expenditures (they just went off book) while trying to appear more open, which was a way to get the West's eyes off the USSR's business. It was signed at the twilight of the USSR - by the end of 1989 there were revolts in East Germany and many of the satellite Soviet states. The Soviet economy had tanked, they were running low on everything and were getting wheat from the West. The wheels were coming off the tractor, as it were, so the Russians were signing agreements with the West to appear more inclusive and open as a way to secure food, currency and political support. The Soviet Navy and the US Navy conducted joint exercises, and warships from the USSR docked in San Diego while US Navy vessels docked in Vladivostok. It was all a show. Included in that show was Open Skies. 

Was it important? As a sign of peace and reconciliation? Sure. But, did it have military value? No. US spy satellites routinely take very clear and accurate photographs, it's how the US knew what was going on in Ukraine and could orient sea-to-land missiles from ships. So, does Open Skies provide valuable intel? Not really. Open Skies requires specific equipment flying along specific routes, so obviously countries prepare for those missions. With the advent of spy satellites and better human intelligence, the US doesn't need Open Skies to provide intel. 

I posit that countries see the agreement as being from an era where reconciliation was possible and Russia may join the Western fold - [there had been talk](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jul-01-op-17546-story.html) of them joining NATO. With Open Skies gone, it doesn't change anything. It just removes the veneer of peace that we constructed for 20 years and pretended wasn't there. 

From the moment Russia emerged from the Soviet rubble, they had called for an elimination of [Jackson-Vanik](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/reassessing-jackson-vanik-amendment) and the establishment of permanent normal trade relations. The US wasn't keen to do that as Russia had long evaded international law and never fully embraced democracy. The Chechen Wars saw gross human rights violations, including a very powerful rape campaign ([read Andrew Meier's book on that](https://www.amazon.ca/Black-Earth-Journey-Through-Russia/dp/0393326411)), installed strongman Ramzan Kadyrov and then started numerous conflicts, including Georgia in 2008. Russia has never followed the rule of law, they have no real free press and much of the country is run by a cadre of politically-connected quasi-political leaders empowered by Putin. But, so long as agreements like Open Skies are in place, and Jackson-Vanik is gone, it gives the appearance of some semblance of Russia's willingness to engage in dialogue with the West. While I don't agree with Trump on much, calling BS to the Russian agreement (whether that's his intention or not) is actually a good move. 

Russia has never been an honest broker or a fair dealer, and as long as we use cognitive dissonance to present that it isn't the case, the more we'll have to contend with in the next couple of decades.",,,dfxd42,f36ogje

The Kurds were given reassurances by the U.S. that the U.S. would keep Turkey from attacking them. 


Turkey views the Kurds as being part of a terrorist organization that exists within Turkey's borders. 

> Turkey considers the YPG (Kurdish People’s Protection Units) and its Syrian political affiliate to be subgroups of Turkey’s Kurdistan Workers’ Party. For decades, the PKK, as it is known, has fought the Turkish military, initially to achieve an independent Kurdish state and more recently to gain a level of Kurdish autonomy inside Turkey.

>Both the United States and Turkey have designated the PKK a terrorist organization, and Turkish-PKK clashes markedly increased in recent months. Turkey also considers the YPG a terrorist group, but the United States does not.

> U.S. officials initially told Turkey that their alliance with the YPG was temporary and that the weapons they supplied to the Kurdish fighters to take back Kobane would be reclaimed. But those promises were quickly overtaken by the need to field an effective ground force against the militants in eastern Syria.



This is a complicated situation, and is not as simple as ""Turkey is conducting an unprovoked attack on the Kurds."" The U.S. has been conducting a balancing act between Turkey and the Kurds, and it looks like the balancing act has ended. What stinks about this whole situation is that the Kurds relied on the U.S. to protect them, and now with Trump's sudden departure they are left vulnerable to a surprise attack.",Artful_Dodger_42,,df8aae,f33uj3a

The catalyst for the decision appears to have been a [phone call](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1063516) between erdogan and Trump in which Trump decided to withdraw, as we don't have a transcript of the call we can't know exactly why he did so, but the previously mentioned isolationist sentiments could give a clue.

,"Your first question was:

>Is this a valid explanation? Must an Ambassador to the United States comply with any order or direction the State Department gives them? Is there anywhere the State Dept’s powers are enumerated in this regard?

First, I want to make sure you understand that Sondland is not an ""ambassador *to* the United States,"" but as stated in your cite, he is the ""U.S. Ambassador *to* the EU."" As to the rest of your question:

The U.S. Constitution does not enumerate the existence of a Start Department at all. The State Department is a part of the President's cabinet, and even the cabinet isn't mentioned in the Constitution. What the Constitution does have to say on the matter is [Article 2, Section 1](https://usconstitution.net/xconst_A2Sec1.html):

>The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.

There really isn't anything in the Constitution that limits the power of the POTUS with regard to the executive branch, so it is generally accepted that the POTUS has [plenary power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenary_power) over the executive branch, which is to say that no other branch of the government has the right to exercise power over the executive branch, except in specific, enumerated cases.

For example, in [Article 2, Section 2](https://usconstitution.net/xconst_A2Sec2.html), the Senate is given the role of Advice and Consent with regard to treaties and appointments. [Article 1, Section 2](https://usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec2.html) grants the House of Representatives ""the sole Power of Impeachment,"" while [Article 1, Section 3](https://usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec3.html) grants the Senate ""the sole Power to try all Impeachments.""

That's about it. If an employee of the Executive branch is given orders that come from the President, whether directly or through the department leadership, then Congress can't do anything about it, short of impeachment.

The second question was:

>Is this obstruction of justice? Some other crime? If so, on whose part, specifically?

The relevant portion of the statute is [18 U.S. Code § 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505):

>Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any [department](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) or[ agency ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505)of the [United States](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505), or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress—

So the question really boils down to whether the order not to testify was ""corrupt"" or ""threatening."" Currently, we have no evidence of a threat, and I personally think that would be unlikely. So then, this comes down to the single question of whether you believe that the order was corrupt. I'm not going to offer any guidance on that question.",postmaster3000,,df409n,f317dzn

When Clinton violated the War Powers Act in Yugoslavia he was sued by 31 members of Congress [Campbell v. Clinton](https://openjurist.org/203/f3d/19), the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled it a  non-justiciable political issue. The court held appellants had ample legislative authority it could exercise to stop appellee's war making, and thus, appellants lacked the power to challenge such executive action in court.

So the only remedies for Congress would be to impeach and/or de-fund military operations against Iran. If they went with the de-funding approach there would be an interesting legal fight over Trump's ability to reallocate military funds to continue military action against Iran.",kfun123,,deqyx0,f30pqiv
,"Some of this comes down to what the purpose of the fine is. If the purpose is to compensate the state or the public, then it shouldn't matter who committed the violation. For example, if I make an illegal U-turn and the state has determined that, based on my chances of causing an accident, I should compensate the people to the tune of $250, then others who commit the same violation should reasonably be expected to pay the same, regardless of whether their income is more or less than mine. The severity of the violation isn't changed by the violator's income.

If, on the other hand, the purpose of the fine is deterrence, then a scaled fine makes sense. Without it, wealthy individuals could just flout the law.

But even so, American culture is heavily steeped in the concept of [equality under the law,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_justice_under_law) encapsulated in a Supreme Court decision around the Fourteenth Amendment that concludes: ""no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."" In addition, the Eight Amendment [prohibits the levying of ""excessive fines,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Excessive_fines) which would likely cover something like your Finland example.

So, if you can't employ an income-based scale of fines for traffic offenses, either for legal or cultural reasons, how do you deter high income individuals from committing multiple, serious violations? Well, [many US states use a ""points"" system for drivers,](https://www.dmv.org/point-system.php) where exceeding a certain number of violations leads to a revocation of the driver's license. Since it applies to all drivers, it's Constitutional and should presumably deter them equally, regardless of income (though I suppose an argument could be made that losing the right to drive has a disproportionally low cost on the few wealthy individuals who can afford to have someone else drive for them).",nosecohn,,devw1h,f2zivsy

It would be conceivable to avoid this concern by distributing any day fines collected (minus the costs of enforcing the laws resulting in the fines) to all registered drivers based on income.

The evidence of the carbon tax in [British Columbia is encouraging:](https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/19/opinions/sutter-carbon-tax-washington-british-columbia/index.html)

> On paper, the tax has been resoundingly effective. Carbon emissions in British Columbia [dropped 5% to 15% because of the tax](https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/ni_wp_15-04_full.pdf). Fuel use, meanwhile, [plunged 16% between 2008 and 2013](http://www.pembina.org/pub/the-bc-carbon-tax), according to a research synthesis by the Pembina Institute. It went up 3% in the rest of Canada. The economy in British Columbia[ slightly outpaced the rest of Canada](http://www.carbontax.org/where-carbon-is-taxed/british-columbia/). According to the premier's office, clean energy jobs are up 12.5% in the same time frame.

A [study](https://journals.openedition.org/sapiens/1072) of European carbon taxes also found it successfully reduced greenhouse gases without a negative economic impact.

> The results indicate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for six member states as a result of carbon-energy taxation under revenue-neutral environmental tax reform (ETR). These effects are mirrored by reductions in total fuel consumption, with the largest reductions occurring in countries with the highest tax rates. Accordingly, the European environmental tax reforms had by 2004 caused reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 3.1% on average for the six member countries examined, with the largest fall recorded for Finland (5.9%). E3ME-results also suggest that ETR-countries did not experience marked impacts on economic growth (GDP). There was a negative effect for energy-intensive industries but due to many exemptions the burden has remained modest and, where revenues have been recycled to lower employers’ costs for social security contributions, generally below 2% of gross operating surplus.

It should not be controversial as a leading policy solution to climate change.  [Even economists of all political leanings embrace it.](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate)

Edit: to address the last part of the question about regressivity, it  depends on how the tax is structured.  A dividend could offset the cost to lower income households, but the liberals rejected the dividend supported by Gov Inslee in Washington. They wanted all funds to go towards clean energy.  It's also a matter of perspective: yes, making gas more expensive now would be difficult, but the poor are likely the ones who will [suffer most](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/climate-change-will-hurt-poor-people-the-most-federal-report.html) under climate change.

,"According to the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition as of April 2019 [46 national and 28 subnational jurisdictions](https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/who/) have a carbon price.

The biggest is the EU's cap and trade system, which is [currently at about $20/ton](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/co2-european-emission-allowances).  To put that into understandable US terms, that's equivalent to adding [$0.18 to $2 gasoline](https://www.resourcesmag.org/common-resources/calculating-various-fuel-prices-under-a-carbon-tax/).  It covers over 11,000 industrial installations in 31 countries.  The revenue of around 3.5B Euros per year is spent by the member countries, not returned as dividends.  Here's a long report on how its spent [Analysis of the use of Auction
Revenues by the Member States](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/ets/auctioning/docs/auction_revenues_report_2017_en.pdf) (pdf).

Some north east US states have a modest program called RGGI (aka Reggie) which covers only electricity and is at a very modest price of about $4/ton.  This price is considered too low to have a noticeable effect on end user behavior but the revenue  is used for things like efficiency incentives and bill assistance for the low income.  There was an article about RGGI yesterday in Vox which is a good explainer, [The Northeast US has a carbon-trading system. It is boosting, not hurting, state economies.](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/4/25/17269544/fossil-fuel-carbon-trading-economies-rggi-northeast).

Some US climate linked programs are progressive, some are regressive.  Those that take the form of tax incentives (wind/solar credits, carbon sequestration credit, etc) are as progressive as the US tax code.  On the other hand, state renewable portfolio electricity standards (requiring certain percentages from low carbon sources) have the effect of being regressive since they raise prices equally for all incomes.

I like the idea of a carbon price with a dividend, but I think the dividend should be progressively weighted.  If that happens, I predict it will be condemned as socialistic redistribution by conservatives, perhaps even some of the same ones now decrying a carbon price for being regressive.",thinkcontext,,desj9t,f333wuf

,"The deeper root cause of protests is two fold. 1) there is a wide gap between the government's promises and its deliverable services and 2) perhaps more importantly, Iraq is a deeply divided country with[ a very poorly imposed democracy that many don't like](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/07/angry-iraqis-yearn-for-military-rule-again/) and overwhelmed by external influence. 

1)The easiest way to quell unrest is [simply by placating the masses](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-logic-of-authoritarian-bargains/). As is evidenced in dozens of poor and/or authoritarian states, if one keeps expectations low and meets them people are generally quite content to carry on their lives. For Iraq however, this has not been the case. 

Primarily, [basic security has been abysmal](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9481/index1.html). Iraq suffers from [porous borders](https://ctc.usma.edu/iraqs-border-security-key-to-an-iraqi-endstate/), internal and external rogue elements, a lack of security infrastructure, [low morale among the military and police force](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/world/middleeast/american-intelligence-officials-said-iraqi-military-had-been-in-decline.html), and a self-dealing security apparatus. Secondarily, the Iraqi government has not been able to deliver on the [basic needs of the people](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-07/15/c_137326184.htm) despite [promises](https://taskandpurpose.com/iraq-protests-sadr-city) (both electoral and otherwise) to do so. This has been due to a rampant corruption mentality which persists and allies with bad timing. 

The corruption is in part tied to the lack of oversight and institutionalization of democratic and meritocratic norms. 

As for the allies, Iraq has relied heavily on promises of it's rich and powerful neighbors to help prop up an unpopular government which is closely aligned with those foreign interests, Iran and Syria. However, their timing is bad. Catastrophically bad. Just as Iraq was beginning to work out some semblance of stability in the West with Sunni tribes after the Surge, they relied heavily on the [Syrian military to \(heavily handed\) control the spread of AQ and AQI elements](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-resurgence-of-al-qaeda-in-iraq/).

I[SIS filled a security need which the Iraqi military was not providing](https://www.rand.org/international/cmepp/research-areas/syria-iraq-isis.html) in the West and soon was overrun. Even with the ""defeat"" of IS, Iraq has not provided consistent security to these Sunni majority regions and many find themselves semi-autonomous again. This acts like a [insurgent and protest incubator](https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-resurgence-of-al-qaeda-in-iraq/) on the part of the Sunnis living in the region. Back to Iran! Iran sees Iraq as a vital part of its [Shiite coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_crescent) however, it seems every time they attempt to actually help in a way that delivers more than political headaches and [para-military militias](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/part-2-pro-iran-militias-iraq), world events conspire against them.

Then as the focus of the US shifted, [Iran began to promise more to Iraq](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/despite-us-pressure-and-decreased-popularity-among-iraqis-iran-is-staying-in-iraq/).

[This is established fact,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraqi-military-admits-to-excessive-force-in-crackdown-against-protesters/2019/10/07/2fb11db6-e908-11e9-a329-7378fbfa1b63_story.html) not just ""some sources"".

With that out of the way, this is a huge can of worms because you're asking us to provide an overview of regional *and* Iraqi politics going back *at least* 1.5 decades. But I'll point out a few things:

The protesters are [young](http://www.mtv.com/news/3141745/youth-led-anti-government-protests-iraq/) - 18-23 years old. They have never really experienced Iraq in a state of non-war and generally have little connection to any narrative before 2003. This means there's a point at which ""being secure at any cost"" simply doesn't cut it - as the security situation has finally reached some stability, underemployed young men don't just want to not die; they want see 'trickle down' of the record oil profits, but none of it goes to them - [unemployment is >25%,](http://www.brookings.edu/saban/~/media/Files/Centers/Saban/Iraq%20Index/index.pdf) reconstruction is incredibly [slow,](https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/plight-of-iraqi-man-refocuses-spotlight-on-country-s-slow-reconstruction-1.815753) health infrastructure is [""in crisis"",](https://enablingpeace.org/healthcare-in-crisis/) etc. but perception of corruption is *very* high [(ranked: 168/180)](https://www.transparency.org/country/IRQ). And while security is a more fundamental requirement, promises were made to the Iraqi people . As we saw in the Arab Spring, [young, unemployed, college-educated men facing economic insecurity in the face of corruption is probably the #1 statistical correlation](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/forecasting-instability-the-case-the-arab-spring-and-the-limitations-socioeconomic-data) with outright rebellion. [Here's a decent report on Iraqi dissatisfaction with government.](https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/NDI%20Iraq%20Survey%202019_EN_0.pdf) And here is a [good report on trust in various security elements]() - take note of the distrust in PMU. Corruption is entrenched under the rule of sectarian - read: Iranian/foreign - political parties. [Removing General Saadi was a *terrible* idea](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2019/09/29/iraqs-removal-of-counterterrorism-chief-sparks-controversy/) that helped spark additional resentment - the Iraqi SOF were a major source of Iraqi pride and trust in government security, especially among Sunnis, but interestingly also among Shiites; some in Iraq see his removal as a change from trusted Iraqi security forces to additional emphasis on deeply mistrusted Iranian-funded-and-trained PMF. See: [the torching of the Iranian consulate in Shia-majority Basra.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45453215) I think this speaks to a sort of [new civil society in Iraq](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/crp/2019/10/03/protest-movements-in-iraq-in-the-age-of-new-civil-society/) that is more nationalist in response to a period of ""traumatic sectarianism"".

And since these protesters have little connection to what the government believes, they see the status quo - corruption, bad social services, unemployment - and they tack it onto the government, which is [influenced enormously by Iran.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-iraq-iranian-power.html) Similarly, they blame Iranian-funded militia groups, etc. There's a reason that ISIS flourished, beyond just [de-Baathification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification) - ISIS was able to tackle corruption. Rukmini's interviews show many Iraqi's reported being able to access responsive policing without bribes for the first time under ISIS, government structure that not only claimed a real (if brutal) alternative to secular government's failures, but also followed through in many ways.

Effectively the below market rate loans given by the Eu governments to airbus are a subsidy (as defined by the rule, it comes from a government, is a financial contribution, and confers a benefit).  Because these are to a specific business and not openly available relief (as say a tax cut to on certain kinds of aircraft sales would be, or a loan or tax credit offered as part of an open bid contract) these unfairly distort the market.

,"**What are the protections given to the whistleblower?**

They followed the process of, and are entitled to the protections of [the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA).](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/R45345.pdf)

That law, combined with the Inspector General Act of 1978 provides that:

>The Inspector General shall not, after receipt of a complaint or information from an employee,
disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the Inspector
General determines such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation.

ICWPA exists to allow members of the intelligence community to report waste, fraud, or abuse without fear of reprisals for their jobs.  Reprisal or a threat of reprisal against a whistleblower is prohibited by the law.  

In addition, general Federal law [prohibits reprisals](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/2302) for reporting information to Congress.

**Why/when were they put into place?**

The system of inspectors general was erected [following Watergate](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2013/03/lessons-of-watergate-scandal-still-resonate/) as a means of reporting wrongdoing outside of normal executive branch channels in order to let Federal employees report serious abuses, especially to Congress.  ICWPA was a relatively late addition though, only being implemented in the 1990s.

**Does Trump have any right to face his accuser?**

This is a two facet question:  Would he have this right in an impeachment proceeding, and would he have this right in a criminal proceeding?

The answer to both is ""no.""

* Right of confrontation in a criminal proceeding

[Not unless the whistleblower were called as a witness against him in a legal proceeding.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/right_to_confront_witness)

Anonymous tips are frequently used to initiate investigations in criminal law contexts. If law enforcement can independently corroborate the tip, they need not call the tipster to the stand, or even disclose who they are.  

[This Supreme Court case has a very similar fact pattern (on an unrelated issue otherwise)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17799029384462151344&q=confrontation+warrant+tip&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33)

In that case, an anonymous tip came to police about illegal gambling.  The police investigated using non-compulsory means, and obtained enough information to swear out a warrant affadavit.  The officers who investigated testified, but the tipster did not.

In this case, the whistleblower is in the role of the anonymous tipster, and the Intelligence Community Inspector General is in the role of the police.  The ICIG investigated the tip by interviewing other employees and [found it credible.](https://www.dni.gov/files/ICIG/Documents/News/ICIG%20News/2019/September%2030%20-%20Statement%20on%20Processing%20of%20Whistleblower%20Complaints/ICIG%20Statement%20on%20Processing%20of%20Whistleblower%20Complaints.pdf)

As such, the ICIG would be competent to testify in a criminal proceeding about what he discovered in his investigation, and between that and [the fact that the WH released a rough transcript of the call](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/25/trump-ukraine-phone-call-transcript-text-pdf-1510770) I don't think a prosecutor would need to call the whistleblower, meaning there would be no confrontation issue.

In theory, Trump could seek to subpoena the whistleblower as a defense witness, but that could be a bad idea tactically, and if Trump were still President, could constitute unlawful retaliation under ICWPA and other whistleblower laws.

* Right of confrontation in impeachment

Impeachment does not necessarily follow the normal rules of criminal procedure.  In the case of [Walter Nixon v. United States](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/506/224) the Supreme Court ruled that Judge Nixon could not raise a challenge to the trial procedures used by the Senate to remove him, and that impeachment procedures were entirely in the control of the Congress because the Constitution's grant of power to Congress on impeachment is absolute.

If during a trial the Senate wished to give him the right to confront witnesses, it would be allowed to, but there are no requirements except those the Senate decides upon.

This likewise applies to pre-articles-of-impeachment proceedings in the House.  The House has sole power over its rules, and over initiating impeachment, and can do what it likes.",huadpe,,de5hfd,f2w4bpl

,"Legally, the line is at whether the public official is seeking/receiving a personal benefit, or if they are seeking/receiving a public benefit.

So for example, the classic examples of [pork barrel spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_barrel) where a member of Congress seeks federal money for specific projects in their district is not bribery, because they are not personally receiving the benefit of the money.  They may get a political benefit from having brought home the bacon, but ""politician does something popular; gets political benefit"" is not bribery.  So for the example in the OP, supporting a farm bill in exchange for supporting infrastructure spending is not bribery, because it's trading one public benefit for another.  

On the other hand, when the politician stands to get a **personal** financial or other tangible benefit, that is when it can become bribery or another form of corruption.

So for example [a US Senator was once convicted of bribery for taking cash in exchange for voting a certain way on changing Post Office rates.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5938180396611724449&q=congressman+bribery&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33)  In that case, the benefit wasn't to the public, but because the Senator received money.

The question with the Ukrainian scandal is whether in seeking an inquiry into the Bidens, the President was seeking something for his personal benefit, or for a public benefit.  Likewise in respect to his other known request of the Ukrainian government, an investigation into [a ridiculous conspiracy theory about the 2016 election.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/us/politics/trump-ukraine-conspiracy.html)",huadpe,,ddshlb,f2xkh9n
,"Let me preface this by saying I am by no means a federal bribery law expert, nor do I purport to have solved the more difficult question of what constitutes an impeachable offense.

The short answer is that the *[US v. Blagojevich](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20150721130)* expressly stated that logrolling, e.g., political favors, is not bribery under the law. A political act for a political act is not a bribe. A bribe, in contrast, is an official act for a thing of *value*. This is based on [18 USC 201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201). Political acts can be valuable, yes, but case law has yielded political acts in exchange for political acts as a necessary way of conducting legislative business and outside the ambit of corrupt exchanges of official acts for things of value.

With that distinction in mind, let's separate Ukraine and the NRA.

President Trump's [conversation](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-call/index.html) with President Zelensky is less about violation of a particular statute and more about what constitutes an impeachable offense. We have the US [Constitution's language](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-ii) that ""The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" Outside of that language, we have minimal guidance.

[Legal experts contend](https://www.lawfareblog.com/constitution-says-bribery-impeachable-what-does-mean) that Bribery under Article II is not limited to the statutory definition of bribery. Indeed, the US Constitution predates most of our federal statutes, so such an interpretation would effectively state that Article II is without teeth unless and until there is a complementary statute on the books. That doesn't make a lot of sense, and there's no suggestion or intimation of that in case law.

This is why people say an impeachable offense is whatever the House and Senate say it is. ""Bribery"" can be described in a number of ways: how the founders envisioned it while drafting; the definition and practice under English common law, upon which most US law is based; our modern normative understanding of bribery, etc. I don't mean this as political comment, but the claim of ""no quid pro quo"" is technically only relevant under a statutory analysis that need not be conducted for the reason mentioned above: the Constitutional language under which President Trump could be impeached is not restricted to the federal bribery statute or the case law fleshing that statute out.

Additionally, Congress (and the American people) could choose to view President Trump's acts in a much broader scope. They could look at this conversation (or many acts of his presidency, depending on the articles drafted) and determine that they are generally conduct unbecoming of a US President; that there is a pattern of many abuses of power, and; that all of these acts taken as a whole, be they alleged bribery or obstruction or anything else, constitute ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""

There is so much more to unpack here so I will leave the Ukraine analysis with this: if one wants to use the federal bribery statute as the north star, then the elements should be one's guide:

- Was the act corrupt?
- Would the President receive a thing of value?
- Would the thing of value influence the President to perform an official act, commit (or aid in) fraud, withhold from an official duty obligated under law, or influence testimony/affirmation under oath?

The argument from Democrats is effectively ""Yes, opposition research into the Biden family is a thing of value, and the official act is withholding military aid that was blessed by Congress."" For Republicans, the lens is narrower, and uses the federal bribery statute's [case law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/89-1918.ZS.html) requiring ""quid pro quo."" I won't dive into whether asking President Zelensky for such a favor constitutes quid-pro-quo because that is discussed at length elsewhere, but it provides some parameters to the conversation.

Pivoting to the NRA, I'll keep it brief. This is distinctive because we are now dealing with the President and a US corporation. The questions regarding Presidential impropriety remain the same with respect to impeachment. The dynamic is different because the NRA is subject to US jurisdiction and the bribery statute captures behavior by both the party who offers a thing of value and the recipient. Here, we have the following issues and questions:

- The President cannot be indicted while he is sitting in office per the [OLC memo](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%E2%80%99s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution), so we have the same impeachment questions as above;
- President Zelensky, who is a foreign head of state. The NRA is a  non-profit [corporation](https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/) and Wayne LaPierre a citizen. The NRA and Mr. LaPierre can be criminally prosecuted and, unlike President Zelensky, if there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, probably would be prosecuted. We are unlikely to prosecute a head of state under our federal bribery statute, jurisdiction questions notwithstanding, and the facts don't bear that President Zelensky was a bad actor in this case.

Finally, as a general matter, many of these questions are fact-specific. Intent will be fact-specific, for example. So even if there were equivalencies between exchanging political favors and exchanging/withholding official acts for things of value, anyone purportedly running afoul of bribery rules would have an opportunity to demonstrate that, on the facts, their case is distinctive. Because of the *Blagojevich* ruling, it's unlikely we would prosecute legislators for quid-pro-quo limited to mutual political favors, but if it became a close call, they would simply have to make their case in front of a judge and show why they were exchanging political favors, not something else of value.",PepperoniFire,,ddshlb,f2xknct

>The NRA has recently been accused of trying to bribe Trump because they reportedly declined offer support against impeachment unless Trump softened his stance on gun restrictions. Is lobbying inherently Quid Pro Quo?

> How can we expect politicians compromise on legislation if they might be accused of Quid Pro Quo? 

Quid pro quo is not an issue. It denotes a clear exchange of one favor for another, though. 

> For example, if a senator agrees to back a farm subsidy bill that doesn’t directly benefit his state in exchange for another senator backing more funding for infrastructure which does directly benefit his state, is that Quid Pro Quo?

Yes. And it is okay for that to be the case, although politicians who do this often may frustrate their constituents and not be able to vote.

,"The one similar situation I've found is when [Nixon requested that the North Vietnamese government stall peace talks with LBJ in order to help him win the election. ](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/russia-dnc-hack-donald-trump-foreign-governments-hacking-vietnam-richard-nixon-214111)  He succeeded,  and while the NSA learned of the ploy by intercepting a cable they opted not to investigate it further due to not having a ""smoking gun"" linking it to Nixon.  Nixon went on to break the law repeatedly in order to get elected again and eventually resigned in disgrace over the Watergate incident.

Asking a foreign government to investigate a US citizen is not generally a crime.  For a non-government US citizen asking for investigations into another US citizen,  the main limit is the [corrupt foreign practices act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act#targetText=The%20anti%2Dbribery%20provisions%20of,directing%20business%20to%2C%20any%20person.).  This makes it illegal to bribe foreign officials.  For example,  Elon Musk urging the Thai government to investigate ""pedoguy,"" wasn't illegal, but if he told them he wouldn't build a factory there unless they investigated the guy then it would be illegal foreign bribery. 

For appointed executive branch employees,  there are also bound by [conflict of interest laws](https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Use+of+Government+Position+and+Resources)).  If they would benefit personally or financially from the person being investigated,  requesting it would be breaking these rules unless they followed proper procedures: generally disclosing those conflicts in advance and getting an independent justification for the request from someone without a conflict.   The norm is to not initiate these sorts of requests at the appointee level.  For example,  if the attorney general's ex wife commits election fraud then he is expected to [recuse himself](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/recusal.pdf).  I'm uncertain what the penalty for not doing so would be,  but losing his law license and getting impeached are likely possibilities. 

For officials campaigning for election, there are additional limits which apply if the person being investigated is a political opponent. [Code §30121. Contributions and donations by foreign nationals](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:52%20section:30121%20edition:prelim\)) governs this,  as an investigation into a political opponent is something of value.   Soliciting it breaks this law.   Of note, an elected official who isn't running for election (such as Obama in 2016) is not bound by this law.  

Asking for an investigation into an opponent can also be considered an abuse of power,  particularly if official power is used to encourage the foreign government to investigate.   As far as I can find,  there isn't a law specifically outlawing this.   However,  it falls into a category which is impeachable even if it isn't a crime.

>Does the Constitution require a full House vote for an impeachment inquiry to occur? Does Pelosi need to wait for the House to return from recess to hold such a vote?

An impeachment inquiry is not a technical or Constitutional term. Congress is using it's normal powers to investigate whether or not they should impeach.

The Constitution has this to say about impeachment:

1. The House has the sole power to impeach.
2. The Senate has the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for this purpose they will be on oath or affirmation. If the President is tried, the Chief Justice will preside over the trial. A conviction cannot be reached without the agreement of 2/3 members present.
3. The President has the power of pardon, which does not extend to impeachment.
4. The President and Vice President shall be removed from Office on The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

The respective chambers of Congress have the sole power over impeachment and trying impeachment. The rules, outcome, and interpretation unless otherwise spelled out is entirely up to them. **It is a political process, not a legal process.**

>Is Congress able to obtain the subpoenaed information anyway under its powers of [congressional oversight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_oversight#Powers_and_prerogatives)?

Treason is defined in the constitution. Bribery is not and High Crimes and Misdemeanors are not.

To answer your OP, no, an impeachment inquiry does not require a full House vote. An impeachment inquiry is what precedes a vote by the house to adopt articles of impeachment (which only needs a simple majority). There's no need to vote on whether an impeachment inquiry should happen. It can be instigated as a result of another investigation (as happened in the case of Clinton) but the House Judiciary Committee can start an impeachment inquiry all on its own.

,"Not an expert, but saying no.

[You can read about the impeachment process here from this mod post on NP](https://old.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/d8vz0o/mod_post_an_overview_of_the_impeachment_process/). The basics are that the constitution lays out 3 things on impeachment, that civil servants can be impeached for high crimes, that the House has the power to issue Articles of Impeachment by a simple majority, and that the Senate has the power of trial after the House votes to impeach, and requires a 2/3 supermajority vote to do so. Other than that, the entire process is up to the House. Technically speaking, an impeachment inquiry [is not a real thing](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/461399-nadler-impeachment-inquiry-a-made-up-term-but-its-essentially-what-we-are), so there are no rules regarding it. An ""impeachment inquiry"" likely falls under the powers of Congressional Oversight. Congress has [implicit investigatory and oversight powers](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Investigations-Oversight/#targetText=Current%20Practice,and%20what%20occupies%20congressional%20attention.), which have been confirmed by the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_oversight#Report_on_the_Organization_of_Congress) on multiple occasions, with the only stipulations being that they cannot violate civil liberties, and that implicitly the investigation should be related to something the body has authority over (ie, the committee on Agriculture would have more trouble justifying access to IRS records compared to the committee on Ways & Means). So all that being said, it appears that no, absolutely no vote is required for an ""impeachment inquiry,"" because it is simply just a committee of the House performing it's regular oversight powers.

Historically speaking though, a full impeachment inquiry was voted on by the full house, at least when an inquiry was launched. [Most Presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_investigations_of_United_States_federal_officials#Presidents) that had the impeachment process begin, never even got as far as a committee. As far as I'm aware, [there was no formal inquiry when impeaching Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson#Tenure_of_Office_Act), the House just drafted Articles of Impeachment within 3 days of the impeachable offense. With the [Nixon Impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Watergate_scandal#1970s), the full House voted to allow the judiciary committee to launch an impeachment inquiry on [February 6, 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_process_against_Richard_Nixon#Impeachment_inquiry_staff_develops_the_case). During the Clinton Impeachment process, the Judiciary committee voted to investigate on [October 5, 1998](https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/10/05/judiciary.hearing/), and House confirmed this on [October 8th, 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton), which gave the Judiciary full power to investigate.

Interestingly enough though, the committee vote in Clinton's case was based mostly on prosecutor Ken Starr's findings, which basically gave them an outline of impeachable offensives for review, and all they really needed to do was vote on whether or not to move forward. [The committee performed no inquiries/investigations of their own.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton#Impeachment_by_House_of_Representatives) With Nixon's impeachment, since he fired the original prosecutor (Archibald Cox) on October 20th, 1973, before he could submit his findings. Since they did not have information from the special prosecutor, the House Judiciary Committee voted on [October 30th, 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_process_against_Richard_Nixon#Impeachment_inquiry) to begin investigating within the committee (**before** the full House vote on February 6th, 1974). That seems to lend precedent that a committee can investigate without a full House vote. It's also interesting that Nixon interfering with the special prosecutor appears to mirror our current situation, as Trump has been accused of interfering in his respective investigation as well.

So, simply put, there are no formal rules for an impeachment inquiry. Historically, the full House has voted on an impeachment inquiry, but that was not a requirement for a committee to begin an investigation in Nixon's case. Since the current inquiry is contained within 3 committees presently, and Congress has implicit investigatory powers that have been confirmed multiple times by the Supreme Court, it seems like they are good to go, and no full House vote is required.",rsminsmith,,dd942c,f2f84eu

539, 542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (“thing of value” includes “both tangibles and intangibles”); see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b)(1), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes); id. § 641 (theft of government property). For example, the term “thing of value” encompasses law enforcement reports that
would reveal the identity of informants, United States v. Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979); classified materials, United States v. Fowler, 932 F.2d 306, 310 (4th Cir. 1991); confidential information about a competitive bid, United States v. Matzkin, 14 F.3d 1014, 1020 (4th Cir. 1994);
secret grand jury information, United States v. Jeter, 775 F.2d 670, 680 (6th Cir. 1985); and information about a witness’s whereabouts, United States v. Sheker, 618 F.2d 607, 609 (9th Cir. 1980) (per curiam). And in the public corruption context, “‘thing of value’ is defined broadly to
include the value which the defendant subjectively attaches to the items received.” United States v. Renzi, 769 F.3d 731, 744 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). 

When Mueller was applying this definition to the Trump Tower meeting, where Donald Trump Jr. willingly sought out and accepted information being provided by Russian Nationals, this is what Mueller concluded:

> There are reasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a “thing of value” within the meaning of these provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely to
obtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did not obtain admissible evidence likely to meet the government’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these individuals acted “willfully,” i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and,
second, the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A)(i). 

The key difference, however, between the Trump Jr. Tower meeting with Russian Nationals and the current situation involving Trump and Ukraine is that there is an explicit ""quid pro quo"" being established here, where Donald Trump is *clearly* placing value on the information that Ukraine ([and now China...](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-publicly-urges-china-ukraine-investigate-bidens-amid-impeachment-inquiry-n1061956)) can provide to him regarding Joe and Hunter Biden - [that value being the $400+ million in defense aid that we provide them, that Donald Trump confirmed he was withholding.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-froze-aid-call-ukraines-president-probe-biden/story?id=65821429) In the Trump Tower meeting, Donald Trump Jr. was willing to accept that information for free, without providing Russia anything in return, thus it was hard for Mueller to place a tangible value on the information being exchanged.

> Are there any examples of this law being applied in the past? What was the nature of the violation? What was the penalty?

I think the best case we have here is the examples that Mueller provided in my quote above. One thing is to be sure, this specific campaign finance violation is being put to the test by the Trump Administration and Campaign in regards to how far one can go without violating that particular law.

--------------------------

**PERSONAL OPINION TIME:** In my personal opinion, this law is just vague enough that if you seek out INFORMATION from a foreign national, it gets very hard to prosecute or determine if you've violated this law. In today's world, information is just as valuable as anything else, so in my personal opinion, this law needs to be re-worked to very explicitly and carefully outlaw seeking information from foreign nationals in it's ""thing of value"" clause, even if you cannot put a tangible/specific dollar amount on the information provided. If you are seeking out or accepting information that **you know** is coming from foreign nationals related to a campaign, that should be illegal. Again, this is just my opinion.

EDIT: Updated the number from $40+ million to $400+ million.",AFlaccoSeagulls,,dcvlie,f2bxsbx
,"I wrote about this topic a lot when people were asking why getting Russian help is illegal but not the DNC getting information from Christopher Steele. The purpose is to make sure that foreign nationals are not interfering in American elections and that candidates aren't beholden to the interests of foreign groups. I think a lot of what’s being asked is just about definitions, but I mainly want to focus on two things that people keep bringing up, which is “contribute” and “thing of value.” 

A campaign can't receive donations from foreign nationals, but they can pay for their services or products so long as they're paying a fair-market rate and that they report the expenditure to the FEC. So to give an example, a campaign can pay a company in China to make their campaigns hats and T-shirts, and that's perfectly legal. But they can't receive those items for free. That would be a violation of this law.

Another thing to understand is that ""a thing of value"" is very broad and can be anything that helps a campaign in any way, including information on political opponents. Here's what the Mueller Report (Volume 1, p. 186, emphasis mine), says about things of value:

>i. Thing-of-Value Element

>A threshold legal question is whether providing to a campaign “documents and information” of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution. The foreign contribution ban is not limited to contributions of money. It expressly prohibits “a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value.” 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2) (emphasis added). And **the term “contribution” is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws to “include[]” “any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value.**” 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added).
>     
>**The phrases “thing of value” and “anything of value” are broad and inclusive enough to encompass at least some forms of valuable information.** Throughout the United States Code, these phrases serve as “term[s] of art” that are construed “broad[ly].” United States v. Nilsen, 967 F.2d 539,542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (“thing of value” includes “both tangibles and intangibles""); see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b)(1), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes); id. § 641 (theft of government property). For example, the term “thing of value” encompasses law enforcement reports that would reveal the identity of informants, United States v. Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979); classified materials, United States v. Fowler, 932 F.2d 306, 310 (4th Cir. 1991); confidential information about a competitive bid, United States v. Matzkin, 14 F.3d 1014, 1020 (4th Cir. 1994); secret grand jury information, United States v. Jeter, 775 F.2d 670, 680 (6th Cir. 1985); and information about a witness’s whereabouts, United States v. Sheker, 618 F.2d 607, 609 (9th Cir. 1980) (per curiam). And in the public corruption context, “thing of value’ is defined broadly to include the value which the defendant subjectively attaches to the items received.” United States v. Renzi, 769 F.3d 731, 744 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).

So when the DNC contracted with Perkins Coie, who contracted Fusion GPS, who contracted Christopher Steele to work on the Steele Dossier, that was legal because the DNC paid for the work and you can find those expenditures reported on the FEC website.

So in regards to Donald Trump Jr. and the Trump Tower meeting; to me, this seems to be a violation of the law. I'm not a lawyer, but just someone interested in campaign finance, but apparently there's another element to the law, and that is that the defendant must have acted ""knowingly and willfully.""  The Mueller Report (Volume 1, pg. 187, emphasis mine) reads:

>ii. Willfulness
> 
> Even assuming that the promised “documents and information that would incriminate Hillary” constitute a “thing of value” under campaign-finance law, the government would encounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction. Most significantly, the government has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement beyond a reasonable doubt. **To prove that a defendant acted “knowingly and willfully,” the government would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.** U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec. 2017) (“Election Offenses""); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation requires “proof of the defendant’s knowledge of the law""); Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577 (“knowledge of general unlawfulness""). “This standard creates an elevated scienter element requiring, at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear. When there is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts of a particular matter, the offender is more likely to have an intent defense.” Election Offenses 123.
> 
> **On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful.** The investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar with the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual context. The government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or efforts at concealment at the time of the June 9 meeting. While the government has evidence of later efforts to prevent disclosure of the nature of the June 9 meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a showing of scienter, see Volume II, Section II.G, infra, that concealment occurred more than a year later, involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting, and may reflect an intention to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality.

If you'll recall, after the Mueller Report was released there were many headlines saying, ""Trump Jr. wasn't charged because he was too stupid to collude"" and things like that. This is what was being referred to in those articles--that he would have to have acted knowingly and willfully, so it would have been difficult to prosecute a case like that.

,"Presidential harassment is not a legal term and therefore cannot be determined. He seems to think the situation qualifies, and the Democrats do not. 

The appropriate case law seems to be [New York Times Co. v.

The President has consistently asserted that Democrat assertions about him are false, so I would think he would need to show in discovery how that is the case and the Dems knew it at the time. I have no idea what court would have jurisdiction here, but I imagine it would be the District Court in Washington. Please note that I am not a lawyer.

,">Are his claims about this correct? Is there a standard which separates harassment from normal oversight?

No.  There are standards for what information Congress is and is not entitled to, but investigating official conduct is not any form of harassment, and is Congress' legal right.  

The President does enjoy executive privilege in respect to some of his communications, however, [court cases have held](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/418/683.html) that the privilege is not absolute and can be overcome for some other pressing needs (in that case, for a criminal trial).

Trump's objection seems to be to the existence of the investigation and hearings themselves.  That is of course not something he can validly object to.  Each House of Congress [makes the rules of its proceedings](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei) and can hold hearings on whatever they like, including impeachment, which is a power expressly reserved to the House of Representatives.

>President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani has said he is considering lawsuits against individual Congressional democrats related to their impeachment inquiry, which Giuliani called ""illicit."" Is there a legal basis for such a suit?

Absolutely not.  It is such a frivolous claim that Giuliani could face attorney discipline for bringing it.

In particular the Constitution says:

>and for any speech or debate in either House, they [Senators and Representatives] shall not be questioned in any other place.

You cannot sue a member of Congress for anything they do or say in the course of their official conduct.  [This report gives a good overview of the clause.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45043.pdf)

>Would Trump have any other legal recourse related to the inquiry?

No.  The Supreme Court [held in the case of judge Walter Nixon](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/506/224.html) that Congress, and Congress alone, has the power over impeachment.  Any alleged infirmity in an impeachment process is not subject to judicial review.  In impeachment, Congress is supreme.",huadpe,,dcgcns,f2b3kq7
,"This is an odd situation for a variety of reasons.

1. Trump seems to be fairly polarizing, or at least I am lead to believe so.  Therefore opinion about him is less neutral and more one sided.  This makes finding netural sources more difficult.

2. He has been under investigation for various things nearly his entire presidency.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_Report  This makes a good case for both sides.  Either he is really corrupt and just has so many offenses, or he is innocent and the other side is making an enormous effort to drag him through the mud.

3. Both sides are pretty adamant that the other side is corrupt or otherwise committing crimes, and will tailor the exact same piece of information to cater to their talking points.

Example, The Mueller Report:


Right leaning takes:

https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nope-donald-trump-not-exonerated-14183291




There are really three major possibilities for what is going on right now:

1. The democrats are right and Trump has committed crimes and therefore are justified in pursuing this course of action.

2. Trump is right, and the democrats are just trying to drag him through the mud.  This seems to be a case of slander (althrough to be fair I'm not a lawyer and I don't know if this is what they would pursue) https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/slander , however I believe his lawyers would be justified in pursuing action.  In particular, they would have a case against anyone who ""made up"" facts https://www.factcheck.org/2019/10/schiffs-parody-and-trumps-response/.

3. Both sides are wrong a little bit and the truth lies somewhere in between.  This is the most likely scenario, but due to Trump's polarization, probably one of the least likely sides that we'll see people arguing for.

I'll keep my personal conjecture out of it.",Dyson201,,dcgcns,f28trl1
,"There was a comment here about education being key, since activists/protesters are poorly-informed, yet passionate, on some issues like forestry. That comment was deleted due to a lack of sources, so let me help out:

Both countries have roughly the same amount of forested land now as they did 100 years ago. The U.S. has about 745 million acres of forest, or 72 percent of the original forest cover that existed prior to European settlement. Canada has about 995 million acres of forest, or 91 percent of its original forest cover, more than any other country

,"That's the ~~billion~~trillion dollar question isn't it? How do we support these communities through the transition.

The classic answer is retraining. As Andrew Yang has made clear on his campaign, [the data indicates that retraining programs do not work on a large scale.](https://www.yang2020.com/blog/ubi_faqs/cant-just-retrain-people-lose-jobs/) His proposal is that the solution begins with universal basic income (UBI), guaranteeing a sum of money for individuals to cover basic needs until they are able to--hopefully--transition to a new job.

[The Green New Deal](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text), a resolution proposed by Ocasio-Cortez, calls on the federal government to transform the United States’ energy infrastructure and economy to deal with the climate crisis. The resolution includes a call to create millions of high-wage union jobs through a federal jobs guarantee and a just transition for vulnerable communities. As it is now, this proposal is moot since there's not enough details how these goals will be achieved.

 Several Democratic presidential candidates have offered plans to support coal communities while moving the U.S. to a greener economy. Former Vice President Joe Biden’s plan would guarantee benefits for coal miners and increase the payments coal companies make into a federal program to help miners battling with black lung disease.

Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plan would also guarantee health care coverage and pensions for coal miners, while [Senator Bernie Sanders pledged to spend $1.3 trillion to ensure that coal miners and workers in other carbon-intensive industries receive strong benefits, a living wage, skills training and job placement.](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/bernie-sanders-proposes-renewables-buildout-and-public-electricity#gs.1yjl9n)

It all comes down to money. What kind of money people impacted by the transition will need or will be satisfied with, and who will pay for it. Realistically? People are going to be left behind. Let's look at coal miners to see what some the challenges are, since those same challenges ring true for all industries at risk of decline or are declining.

1. They have high paying jobs. At current salary levels, a miner would need two solar installation jobs in order to earn what they make now. It's unrealistic to expect even a willing and able miner would be able to transition into a job that will compensate them as well as their mining job did. These miners might not even have completed high school. Their opportunities are limited so miners stand to see a drastic decrease in quality of life.

2. As Yang points out, many of the workers who are most at risk for displacement are middle-aged and past their primes. Many have health problems. These are not desirable traits that employers are looking for.

3. Many people not only make their living in the mines, but see their livelihoods as a source of great pride. It's not easy to convince people who has worked the mines for generations to change their way of life.",plaregold,,dcfjzr,f283ok0

," 

The most effective way in my opinion, is to CONTINUE to develop the technologies that allow us to keep those jobs in the pockets of industry like coal. I rarely see this conversation had.

One big example of these technologies is carbon capture sequestration. We can and have already built essentially emission scrubbers ontop of coal plants to reduce negative emissions by 90+ percent. We can adapt already existing plants, that is insanely important. We can even used the collected carbon to manufacture goods. We can and already have done testing on storing the collected carbon in putting it into underground pockets that we extracted shale oil and conventional oil from.

The big question we have to ask ourselves honestly and deeply, is do we REALLY need to find alternative energies right now? Or just find out how to turn our dirty energies into ""green"" energies. We are already doing it, but the climate change activists haven't had a serious look at its potential.

If we put the effort into the technology, we could create a world war scale effort into production of these machines to literally pull those problems out of the air rather than spending insane amounts of money to make shiny tech to make us feel like we are doing the best thing to do for all future generations.

Biden WANTED Burisma thoroughly investigated. Why? The international community was all demanding it at the time. British authorities had requested information from Shokin's office as part of an investigation into alleged money laundering by Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevskiy. Shokin ignored them.

The candidate's proposals do not address the employment of family members. Since it is trying to strengthen the rules governing the politicians, I think you can infer that rules for the family are even weaker.

As an aside, there are hundreds/thousands of cases of this and legislating it away is morally and practically difficult. Politicians have the ability to affect every single industry. Therefor, to make this illegal is to essentially end the independent lives of the families of politicians. Just try and pass a strict bill banning spouse/child employment and see if they can ever go home or have their grandkids over for thanksgiving.

So then lets create a compromise. How would you separate the legitimate from the corrupt? I am not saying it is impossible, but I think what you want to do is focus on corrupt actions and quid pro quo.

What was that money buying, exactly? Certainly not irreplaceable skills or leadership ability. So what was it?
- Joe Biden’s direct, personal involvement in a matter of corruption involving Hunter Biden’s boss [source](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/463307-solomon-these-once-secret-memos-cast-doubt-on-joe-bidens-ukraine-story).

Individually these things are not damning, but taken together they paint a grim picture indeed.

But is it illegal? That’s less clear.

It is important to note, as well, that even if a true conflict of interest did not exist, it behooves all in power to avoid the *perception* of conflicts as well [source](https://www.usq.edu.au/hr/empcond/conflicts); just because I am perfectly capable of fairly and impartially scoring my bitch ex-wife Karen’s performance review, even after what she did to me, doesn’t mean that it is wise for me to do so. Because the perception a reasonable person might have is that, for some reason, I might be biased against the useless cow, even if I’m not. In any way.

Joe Biden might be able to honestly and genuinely look me in the eye and tell me he didn’t let his sons position affect any part of his dealings in Ukraine, but even if that is true, it still looks bad to any reasonable person and *probably* deserved to get investigated.

,"There is a great resource called the Congressional Research Service. They research for the legislative branch of the US government. [Here](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=R45769) is what they gave said regarding impeachment:

**The Impeachment Process in the House of Representatives**

>Under the U.S. Constitution, the House of Representatives has the power to formally charge a federal officer with wrongdoing, a process known as impeachment. The House impeaches an individual when a majority agrees to a House resolution containing explanations of the charges. The explanations in the resolution are referred to as “articles of impeachment.” After the House agrees to impeach an officer, the role of the Senate is to conduct a trial to determine whether the charged individual should be removed from office. Removal requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate. 

The House impeachment process generally proceeds in three phases: (1) initiation of the impeachment process; (2) Judiciary Committee investigation, hearings, and markup of articles of impeachment; and (3) full House consideration of the articles of impeachment.  

Impeachment proceedings are usually initiated in the House when a Member submits a resolution through the hopper (in the same way that all House resolutions are submitted). A resolution calling for the impeachment of an officer will be referred to the Judiciary Committee; a resolution simply authorizing an investigation of an officer will be referred to the Rules Committee. In either case, the committee could then report a privileged resolution authorizing the investigation. In the past, House committees, under their general investigatory authority, have sometimes sought information and researched charges against officers prior to the adoption of a resolution to authorize an impeachment investigation.

Impeachment proceedings could also be initiated by a Member on the floor. A Member can offer an impeachment resolution as a “Question of the Privileges of the House.” The House, when it considers a resolution called up this way, might immediately vote to refer it to the Judiciary Committee, leaving the resolution in the same status as if it had been submitted through the hopper. Alternatively, the House might vote to table the impeachment resolution. The House could also vote directly on the resolution, but in modern practice, it has not chosen to approve articles of impeachment called up in this fashion. Instead, the House has relied on the Judiciary Committee to first conduct an investigation, hold hearings, and report recommendations to the full House. 

Committee consideration is therefore typically the second stage of the impeachment process. In recent decades, it has been more common than not that the Judiciary Committee used information provided from another outside investigation. The committee might create a task force or a subcommittee to review this material and collect any other information through subpoenas, depositions, and public hearings. Impeachment investigations are governed by the standing rules of the House that govern all committee investigations, the terms of the resolution authorizing the investigation, and perhaps additional rules adopted by the committee specifically for the inquiry.  

If the committee determines that impeachment is warranted, it will mark up articles of impeachment using the same procedures followed for the markup of other legislation. If the Judiciary Committee reports a resolution impeaching a federal officer, that resolution qualifies for privileged consideration on the House floor; its consideration is the third stage of the impeachment process. The resolution can be called up at the direction of the committee and considered immediately under the hour rule in the House. If called up this way, amendments could be precluded if a majority voted to order the previous question. A motion to recommit, with or without instructions, is in order but is not subject to debate. Alternatively, the House might alter these procedures by unanimous consent to, for example, set a longer time for debate or to allow brief debate on a motion to recommit. A resolution reported from the Rules Committee could also be used to structure floor debate.  

If the House approves the impeachment resolution, it will appoint managers to present and argue its case against the federal officer in front of the Senate.<

,"There is no legal process for impeachment inquiry. The only constitutional dictate is that the house has the power to impeach. Announcement of an official inquiry is thust messaging and theatrics.

Any rules for the process leading up to passing articles of impeachment are by custom and self regulation.

No, because inquiry and oversight into the executive is a fundamental power of congress. The inquirys were on going before any official announcement.

,">Do Presidential powers allow a President to dictate terms on appropriated Congressional aid to a foreign country? 

This is a statutory question, not a constitutional question.  The Congress could make foreign aid conditional, or make it unconditional.  If the foreign aid was conditional, the President would have a role in determining whether the conditions were met.  

[This article](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531) from before the thing really blew up into a huge scandal makes it unclear which is the case.

>For example, suppose President Trump said Ukraine would not receive aid until they pledged to hold a public referendum on joining NATO. Can a President set such conditions on Congressional approved aid?

Again, would depend on whether Congress has said he can.  Congress could set specific conditions (if the country does ABC then it gets the aid) or it could set general conditions to let the President use the aid as leverage in negotiations.

>Specific to the ongoing Ukraine story with President Trump, are there any legal issues raised when a President asks a foreign nation to investigate US citizens? What about political opponents, other groups?

In some cases the US will of course have an interest in international legal cooperation.  If the US is pursuing a criminal case against an American based in part on their conduct outside the US they will need cooperation from foreign governments in serving subpoenas and obtaining documents and the like.  For example in the trial of Paul Manafort, the government relied heavily on [cooperation from Cypriot officials in obtaining bank records to show money laundering.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-paul-manaforts-trial-a-cyprus-bank-is-a-cooperating-witness-1533643200)

The specificity of the request in regards to a particular person, especially when it is so obviously politically motivated and not tied to any ongoing US legal proceeding in this case though makes it clear the President is pursuing this for political, not legal, reasons.

>On question two, does adding the layer of withholding appropriated Congressional aid complicate that legal analysis?

Given the totality of the circumstances, it would turn it from possibly legal (or possibly a campaign finance violation) into full-blown felony bribery.  

Former [AMA guest](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7nnncq/this_is_rick_hasen_ready_for_my_first_ama/) Rick Hasen [makes the case here that it is a campaign finance violation whether or not there was a quid pro quo.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/09/trump-ukraine-campaign-finance-crime.html)

,"So one really interesting point that I found when researching this point is that two-thirds of state pension assets consist of what is called ""corporate equity"", or stock. Because although they are generally riskier than things like corporate bonds, treasury bonds, and many other federally backed securities, they do bring in higher returns. And apparently they're also increasingly investing in whats now called ""[alternative investments](https://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/slp_55.pdf)"" which include things like private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and commodities, that although can be more risky, would also produce higher returns. A very interesting point that I also found was that state pensions were only really starting to be prefunded in the 70's and 80's after the ""[Employee Retirement Income Security Act](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/retirement/erisa)"" passed after some private pension plans failed. [All states have made several changes to their pension systems](https://www.nasra.org/files/Spotlight/Significant%20Reforms.pdf) to reduce costs, among the most common changes were reduced benefit levels, longer vesting periods, increasing the retirement age, and the service requirements. Now I personally I see two different outcomes from these unfunded pension liabilities (this is less objective and more as how I have taken the information I have read.), first off paying down unfunded liabilities would require a variation of spending cuts and tax increases, according to a 2016 [Brookings study](https://www.brookings.edu/research/financing-state-and-local-pension-obligations-issues-and-options/), it is estimated that states and local governments would have to reduce direct general expenditures by 5.7% to ensure that pension liabilities to not rise. Similarly state and local governments would need to increase total own source revenues 5.3% to close the pension liability gap. But then I also see this in a different light (and if I have this wrong someone please point it out) there does come a point where theres no way that the pension can generate enough revenue to account for demand, you still don't account for current employees who wouldn't have their pensions ""fully funded"" yet, because in a ""prefunded"" pension system employee income is set aside to be invested be it part time, full time, seasonal, or just someone who worked for a year and quit. The best example that I heard for this is ""its like asking your friend if they've fully budgeted for all the service tips they will pay in their lives"" (again if I'm wrong please point it out!). Basically is it better to have a fully funded pension system? Yes, its more secure/safe from insolvency. you don't risk having your benefits cut half way through your career. Is it the end of the world if a pension plan isn't fully funded?.. and to that I say maybe?... its more insecure, but it can be done...

,"So I am going to address this using theory and practical examples of Houston Firefighters' and Houston Police Officers' pensions on how pensions are actually funded: 

in 2015 Sylvester Turner won his mayoral election based on the promise to [resolve the pension crisis rather than cut benefits](https://ballotpedia.org/Sylvester_Turner). 

When he got in office the pension fund actuaries stated the following: 

>[The municipal and police systems respectively have 48 percent and 62 percent of the money they are expected to pay out to retirees over coming decades according to S&P.](https://www.texastribune.org/2017/04/17/spin-debates-escalating-dallas-houston-pension-woes-fester/)

>[The firefighter fund, meanwhile, has about 81 percent of the money it needs to cover future pension costs. That puts it among the best-funded pension funds in the state.](https://www.texastribune.org/2017/04/17/spin-debates-escalating-dallas-houston-pension-woes-fester/)



Here is how that came to be: 

In theory Pension Boards and the union negotiating a contract are separate for public employees where the Union **cannot** bargain away the benefits of the pension board. 

In reality that is not true. 


In reality, what happened in Houston is the following groups made the following choices: 

Municipal Workers (solid waste, public works, clerical, and other city employees): [Traded payments towards their pension benefits for raises in the current fiscal contracting period.](http://www.houstontx.gov/hr/files/employee-relations/HOPE%20Final.pdf) This was done because there was no confidence that the pension fund would survive to cover the current retirees and members. This led to a 48% funding level. 
 
Police Union (Sworn Police): [Traded [deferred pension payments](https://www.texastribune.org/2017/04/17/spin-debates-escalating-dallas-houston-pension-woes-fester/), a pension for the Appointed Police Chief (short term position) for increased base pay, 'incentive' pay (equipment, training, mentorship, uniform allowance, and gang response team pay on par with detectives](https://hpou.org/wp-content/uploads/Final-2018-MC-Draft-Prior-to-Ratification.pdf). 

In addition to the above issues they also had the following issue with DROP (Deferred Retirement Option Plan) which basically let you keep working past 20 years and the pension check you would be getting is instead put into an interest bearing account that you would get upon retirement. Officers working 40 years could [retire with millions of dollars](https://hpou.org/let-me-share-with-you-some-important-details-about-the-pension-bill-and-conclude-with-a-moving-police-week-story-from-elgin/). **The issue with this is something called recalculation**. 

Officers could pay into the pension as a Patrol Officer for 20 years (basic officer making maybe $70,000/yr.) then when they hit DROP they would not pay into their own retirement anymore since it was ""funded"". Then they would promote based on seniority for 10 years moving from a $70,000/yr. bracket to a 110,000-130,000/yr. bracket — **this is the ""salary"" that would be used under recalculation to determine the paid out benefit**. This would allow someone to pay into a system minimally while withdrawing a massively disproportionate amount of money in retirement. This led to a **MAOR** shortfall in the pension. 

Fire Union (Sworn Firefighters): The firefighters passed up pay raises in exchange for steady pension contributions from the city. This led to a funding rate in the mid to high 80% amount — I can pull the actuary memo if needed. 

I'll skip over the SB 2190 legislation except to say that [the billion-dollar pension obligation bond and the raiding of the firefighter pension](http://www.houstontx.gov/txlege/sb-2190-pension-reform) didn't work and the pensions are still sinking. 

I said all that to say this: 

Investment choices like hedge funds and real estate did cause some issues with pensions like the Dallas Police/Fire pension but there is also a lot of sketchy dealing being made by unions in order to get better contracts now even if that comes at the expense of future promised benefits because of a lack of confidence in the pension system and that right so.",MeltedHoustonian,,d8bs0n,f1aa603

This works better for all parties (employees and employers) as the asset allocations are generally more aggressive and so you get higher long-term returns. This is especially true for younger workers who should have more aggressive asset allocations. DC plans work far better than DB plans, which is why the private sector has almost fully switched over and the public sector is in the process of doing so. The cash flow you get at retirement from DC plans is almost always higher than from DB plans due to the allowance for segregated (by individual instead of pooled together) accounts and more aggressive asset allocations.

,"> How do states that have not fully funded their pension programs makeup the difference?

wishful thinking.  There are no effects, yet.  When it hits 0% funded, then payments will stop, or a government bailout will extend payments.  Perhaps, those paying into the pension system will threaten/seek to stop paying into it because 0-day is anticipated.

The way it gets this bad is with unrealistic return assumptions.  The funding levels can be worse than reported if still-optimistic (but lower) funding assumptions are met, or if pension assets are in risky investments desperately trying to catch up.

> any advantages/disadvantages for states that fully fund their pension programs?

Those who will be paid, who die after 0-day,  don't care.  Those making false promises were able to successfully scam workers into working for those promises.  Keeps current taxes low.  Future bankruptcy is some other politicians' problems.

Basic income is a way to solve the fundamental pension lie:  Use pension assets to help fund broader UBI in exchange for guaranteeing their promises.

,"Nuclear is going to have to be a part of any 0-carbon power plan. Wind and Solar are great for steady-state energy, but they can't react to spikes in demand. ~~The only solution is either a lot of expensive batteries that produce a crapload of toxic metal waste, or some other generator that can be adjusted as needed.~~ Natural gas can do that, but then you have the CO2 emissions. Nuclear can also do that, without the Co2, and much more efficiently.

[Integral Fast Reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor#Nuclear_waste) are extremely efficient (like, 99.99% of available energy extracted and used), and safe. IFRs are able to recycle waste from the fuel into more fuel. The only byproducts end up being the highly-volatile isotopes that have half-lives of mere minutes or hours. Those can be stored on-site in containment pools for a short time before they become safe to move to long term storage.

The problem is that people don't understand that nuclear tech has actually advanced since Three-Mile Island and Chernobyl (both of which were mainly caused by humans doing stupid shit, not the tech itself being faulty). Newer designs have passive safeties that will make then shut down on their own if anything goes wrong. In comparison, reactors like the Fukushima-Daichi plant require active safeties, where power is required for the safety systems to work, the problem is that if there isn't any power then the safeties don't work and you get, well, that.

Disclaimer: I am not saying that nuclear is the ONLY way to go. Rather, I am arguing that nuclear is a safe, efficient, and carbon-free power system and should be included in any green energy plan.

EDIT: Just to address a few of the common points of opposition
 
- Cost

GE's PRISM^[1](https://nuclear.gepower.com/content/dam/gepower-nuclear/global/en_US/documents/PRISM%20Technical%20Paper.pdf) design is very cost competitive with traditional LWR designs, owing to the modular design that allows it to be scaled progressively over time. The modules can be fabricated in factories, further cutting the cost of construction. Overall the S-PRISM cost 2.9 cents per kWhr^[2](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/33/020/33020128.pdf), making it very competetive with gas, which costs 3.1 cents per kWhr. In fact, the only cheaper source of energy in the American grid is Hydroelectric, which has plenty of drawbacks of it's own.^[3](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=19&t=3)

- Still experimental/not proven

An experimental IRF reactor design was developed and operated at the Argonne Nat'l Lab between 1984 and 1994.^[4](https://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/integral-fast-reactor.shtml)

- There are other ways

Hydrogen is an incredibly inefficient energy storage medium and more research has to be done to make it commercial viable.^[5](https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Hydrogen-in-a-low-carbon-economy.pdf) Whereas Gen-IV reactor technology is already established and ready for deployment. Oh, and you need electricity to generate the hydrogen through electrolysis anyway, so you might as well have batteries in that case. Geothermal and hydroelectric are highly regional. Many other proposed alternatives are similarly expensive or still in development, while we have this nuclear technology now.

That isn't to say that other methods can't be used at all, but that nuclear is an option that can and should be on the table.

- Safety

Gen-IV reactors use passive safety systems^[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety) and the NRC does not fuck around with nuclear safety.^[7](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/security-enhancements.html)

Passive safety systems mean that no input is required to trigger them. They are baked into the design of the reactors and cannot be disabled or circumvented.

- Radiation!

Radiation exposure from living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant is a tiny fraction of the natural background radiation dose you receive each year.^[8](https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/related-info/faq.html)

- Waste

IFR reactors are highly efficient, almost all of the fuel is consumed and used for power. The small amount of remaining waste has and extremely low half-life, minutes or hours, which means it only needs to be stored on site in cooling ponds for a short time before it is safe to transport to long-term storage.^[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_fast_reactor#Nuclear_waste)

,"So, the entire conversation is going to have to be framed around long-term effects on the climate.

Nuclear power is the second-largest provider of low-or-no-carbon electricity in the world (10%), beaten out only by hydro and with wind at a distant third. It has helped us suppress a potential [55Gt of carbon emissions](https://www.iea.org/publications/nuclear/) in it's history as a technology. Unfortunately, a mixture of market forces and the inherent flaws of the technology make it increasingly uneconomical. There is a reason why nuclear majors such as Exelon, Hitachi and Toshiba are exiting the market. Part of this is indeed state-sponsored phase-out policies. But it should be revealing that 47 of the 54 plants under construction today are by state-owned enterprise, and 6 of the remaining 7 are supported by subsidies and price-regulation.

As alternatives such as wind, solar, and especially liquid natural gas plummet in price, nuclear plant construction has only grown more [costly](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-loan-guarantees-_fact-sheet_.pdf), going all the way back to the late 60s. It has grown more and more expensive because nuclear energy has a negative experience curve - it grows more expensive as we build more and get more familiar with the technology. This effect is due to both increased regulatory burdens, but also in the heightened recognition of risk on the part of plant-owners themselves. This effect can best be observed in advanced economies, such as the vanguard of nuclear generation, [France.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510003526)

In short, humanity's collective experience of the 11 nuclear core-melt disasters has changed the economic calculus. Managing tail-risk has meant a much more sophisticated understanding of how unique each plant has to be. And thus, greater costs.

The clear difficulties are of disaster, waste storage, and unprofitability. In addition, the water requirements for coolant make it unpractical for vast swathes of more arid US States. Finally, it's estimated by a [BOAS report](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0096340212459124) that the world's viable uranium supply (which constitutes the best and cheapest nuclear fuel source) will last for about 80 years. Scaling consumption up by 10 to 15TW, that supply would last about 5 years. Now, in all fairness, the recent failure of Peak Oil theory has shown us the problem of estimating the world's available resources. In addition, technological advancement determines what is ""viable"" or not, and such things do not move along linearly. All the same, we can't very well sit on our hands waiting for those advancements, and substitutes such a thorium are not advancing at rates sufficient enough to match emissions growth. This is more my opinion, but take it as you will.

In all, while I'm critical of nuclear occupying a long term place in our new energy portfolio, I recognize it's critical role for the moment. There are obvious, non-market advantages to keeping nuclear in the mix. At the very least, it will help us suppress emission rates while we develop more marketable technologies and infrastructure. To allow nuclear technology to die, or worse, to actively euthanize it, strikes me as nothing short of foolish. Our current situation is extremely technically and politically difficult. Removing technologies in service of old ideology is short-sighted. I find myself in agreement with the IEA report linked to above: we should keep plants around for as long as possible with a variety of policies. At the same time, our big projects should maintain budgetary focus, and pursue technologies whose relative costs, difficulties and risks make them the better option.",Woah_Mad_Frollick,,d38z2f,f0183yn

Solar power:  ""Overall, generation-weighted solar power plants require on average a total of 3.5 acres/GWh/year""  = 3.5 acres for 1000MWH/year =  3.5 acres for 2.74MWH/day = 3.5 acres for 0.114 MW output on average (assuming my equations are in order). So again, incomparable with nuclear. One benefit to solar is the government subsidies (lol, makes you think). Another is that they are perfectly suited to add to roofs which is free real estate.

Solar and wind are simply non-starters. For one, solar and wind are 17 times more material intensive than nuclear plants. That means solar & wind requires 17 times more mining and extraction to generate the same equivalent amount of electricity as nuclear plants. Further more, solar and wind use 450x more land than nuclear plants. That alone suggests solar and wind are magnitudes more costly in terms of money & ecological degradation than nuclear plants. Next is short-lived solar and wind installations would have to be replaced every 15-25 years forever. Combining these factors makes solar and wind extremely expensive, environmentally destructive and unsustainable.

As seen from the first link, the price of solar is stile in free fall. So economically anywhere we are able to use solar and storage, this is the more viable solution. Considering, a nuclear plant is takes about 10 years to build and run for 40 to 60 years, so the now price comparison is biased against solar. 

Seasonal considerations that can be handled by over production, potential energy storage, power to gas. The implant can be minimized by placing the majority of new power production in the south where solar in most effective and seasonal effect is minimal, then using HVDC to move the power north. 

However, solar does not produce heat, while nuclear power does. So district heating is a source of extra income for nuclear power. Unless this is already in place, this is also a huge infrastructure cost, made slow and expensive by it being added to city infrastructure. 

These consideration makes me conclude that the likelihood of nuclear power being the better option for a region is small. 

Note: I have not considered space usage as a factor, this due to the wast amount of non-arable land in the US. The shade of solar might even make some of the land more fertile.

,"Building nuclear power plants takes more than a decade from planning to operation. Construction is often delayed for years. Solar and wind can be built much faster and more easily. Nuclear plants need specialists for design, construction, and operation. Wind and solar have far lower requirements. A local electrician and construction worker can set up solar panels with only little training. 

As a worldwide energy source it’s also not great. Nuclear proliferation is a huge issue. Most countries just aren’t able to run a nuclear plant safely. Waste is an unsolved issue as well. 

Decommissioning of a nuclear power plant takes a long time and is expensive as well. That’s usually disregarded in calculations. 

Nuclear is great in theory, but very cumbersome an expensive in practice. 

For solving climate change, it’s too capital intensive, too slow to build, and impractical as a global solution. Wind and solar can be built much faster, more easily, and cheaper.

“a subset of renewable energy and represents those renewable energy resources and technologies that provide the highest environmental benefit.

It has always been one of the biggest costs in the budget, and in most places in the United States, the cost of owning a home has consistently outgrown wages - [Source](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/47878-home-prices-are-rising-faster-than-wages-in-80-of-us-markets). 

This means that every year, owning OR renting a home will eat up a slightly bigger slice of your income, while the average wage does not grow to compensate. In practical terms, it means home ownership becomes more and more expensive every year, and as every year passes, our children will have to accept more and more debt in order to own a house.

This seems quite natural, no? The more people there are, the higher the price housing will rise, right? Well, that's not necessarily true. In Japan, housing prices stay fairly consistently flat, despite a far greater population density. There are many explanations for this, but I think the most accurate one is that Japan is willing to build new houses, and most of America is not.

In 2014, Tokyo alone issued permits for 142,417 new housing units to be built. In contrast, the entire state of California, one of the largest economies in the US and one of the most populous states in the US, issued permits for 83,657 new housing units. [Source](https://www.vox.com/2016/8/8/12390048/san-francisco-housing-costs-tokyo). This is the real thing keeping home ownership costs in Japan down. They are willing to build new houses, and they do not allow groups of people with rent-seeking behavior to restrict their development.

You see, once you OWN a home, you have this incentive to restrict new homes being built, because this will lead to significant price increases in your own property. This is why, even though the bay area of California gained 64,000 new jobs in 2015, it added on less than 5,000 new places to live - this caused rent and local real estate value across the region to soar, and everybody who currently owns real estate there benefits, at the cost of everyone else who wants to rent or purchase property there. But who is blocking new housing development in California bay area, you ask?

In the United States, new housing developments are frequently blocked or stopped by NIMBY activists - ""Not In My Back Yard"" groups - who do not want new houses built, for fear that it will reduce the value of their existing real estate. Because every house is near *somebody's* back yard, the result is that far less housing gets built, even when there is a clear need for it. 

In Japan, housing is a policy decided at the national level, not the local level, and thus this problem is nearly nonexistent. If someone in Tokyo wants to knock down a few single floor houses and built a large apartment complex, and he gets the necessary permits, his neighbors have no way to stop him. This means that their rent does not rise as quickly, but it also means that housing stays far more affordable in Tokyo, even though it's one of the largest and most population dense cities on earth.

**tl;dr** One of the biggest parts of cost of living, Housing, is driven by policy at either a local or a national level. The local level drives cost of living way, way up, as local interests defend their benefits.

,"I think you need to be a bit more specific in what you mean. If you just look at ""cost of living"" as a general statement then essentially what you're asking about is inflation.

What I assume you mean to ask is whether specific costs of living have gone down *relative to everything else.* In this case the answer depends on what exactly you want to know about. For example, the cost of education and healthcare have been dramatically brought down by introducing universal government programs such as in Scandinavian countries where healthcare and education are free at point of purchase, with a lower overall cost to the taxpayer than what the US for things like healthcare [source](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/).

,"That's a complicated question. The price of a lot of things have dropped *considerably* over the past few centuries. Automation, fertilizer, pesticides, and other productivity increases have dropped the cost to produce calories *[substantially](https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture)* over the past few hundred years. Electronics prices continue to drop due to Moore's Law. Automation and mass production has caused the price of just about any factory made good to fall over time.

What tends not to decrease in value are things you can't easily make more of (land in a desirable location), or where you can't decouple time from productivity very much (healthcare to some degree and [live performances](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/03/757257796/how-a-string-quartet-explains-healthcare-costs) are an example).

So there are some things that have decreased in costs, and others that stubbornly refuse to. Governments can pretty easily affect the first (who do you think [subsidized](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/farms-race/) all of that fertilizer and pesticide research in the first place?) pretty directly. Government services can have a similar effect (see: mass transit's affordability in Europe vs utter uselessness in many US cities) in some cases. But there's no real way for Government action to make doctors able to spend more time with patients. It can subsidize programs to make more people want to become doctors, but that won't have the kinds of exponential gains we saw with food and electronics. It could subsidize technologies which decouple healthcare from human doctors ([Watson?](https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/) Maybe, [maybe not](https://futurism.com/doctors-ibm-watson-ai).) Public housing and public housing vouchers are a thing, but arguably a UBI is a better option there.

Some of that's racism and prejudice, but some of it's just not wanting to be involved with a government program and the red tape that may come with it. That's less likely when people just have cash.

And of course you'll always have pushback from people who already live above the subsistence line. Why should they be taxed at a higher rate to help people they don't see as deserving the assistance?

,"In addition to my previous post on housing, I would note that the economist has a silly measure for the cost of food called the [big mac index](https://www.economist.com/news/2019/07/10/the-big-mac-index). It was originally intended to be a somewhat light-hearted measure of purchasing power parity between two currencies, but I think it's also helpful for demonstrating how the cost of food has grown over the past few decades.

If you take a look at this guy who [adjusts the big mac price for inflation](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4119246-big-mac-index-may-telling-truth-inflation), in a world where the price of food has remained the same or gone down, the line should be flat. But it has risen, which suggests that the price of the big mac has risen as well. Exactly what has contributed to that price going up is definitely worth greater study. What I do think is worth noting though, is that despite our agricultural practices being more efficient than ever, and us producing more food at a lower price than ever before, and our transport systems transporting them at a lower price than ever before, our food costs seem to be rising, even on the very cheapest scale of foods like McDonald Burgers.",VortexMagus,,d2vh2f,ezz63sc
,"Japan was able to dramatically decrease the cost of housing. I'm going to try to re-source this as it was explained to me:

1970's/1980's Japan was facing similar levels of housing crisis to what America is seeing today, where housing prices are rising at [twice the rate of wage growth,](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/47878-home-prices-are-rising-faster-than-wages-in-80-of-us-markets) restrictive zoning/construction requirements are leading to the development of very little cheap housing, and generally preventing the housing market from supplying exactly what Americans need, when and where they need it.

The Japanese solution was actually quite simple: [dramatically improve zoning.](http://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html)

- Zoning enforcement moved to national level (removing the ability for local cities to zone themselves)

> In Japan, the national government created the zoning law, which it could do by mobilizing expertise to make a good set of laws. That being said, cities aren't completely cut off from the business of zoning. Though the law is adopted by the national government, its local application is left to city governments, as long as they respect the national law

- And the zones that they do have are permissive, allowing maximum use that meets anything below a particular ""nuisance level"" for that zone:

> There are only [12 zones, defined according to the maximum nuisance level they allow,](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sV5ETXDs_8M/Ux-axBTuF2I/AAAAAAAAAsE/E6gs6uJr_8M/s1600/ZonageInclusifJ.JPG) ranging from sleepy residential to polluting industrial uses. The key is that pretty much anything can be built, provided it does not exceed the zone’s nuisance level

This has led to the Japanese market having a noticeable amount of demolition: cities are capable of changing their supply of housing to fit demand; if demand for cheap apartments goes up, houses can be demolished to make way without as many zoning worries. Instead of that micromanaging you see in North America that sees neighborhoods die as they no longer meet local needs, Japan has a much more dynamic, self-regulating housing market.

- Japan also doesn't differentiate between different types of residence as strictly as in America, and their height limits are not arbitrary as they are in America:

> [In N. America,] even different forms of both can be treated as different uses, town homes can be forbidden even in single-use zones, duplexes can be banned from zones planned for apartment blocks. In Japan, there is no such segregation. Residential is residential. If  a building is used to provide a place to live to people, it's residential, that's all. Whether it's rented, owned, houses one or many households, it doesn't matter.

Building height requirements are based around [sunlight they block,](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V6hn4o-O-Jg/Ux-o0CxMJjI/AAAAAAAAAss/R6o_2PQd9wc/s1600/ZonageJPhauteur.JPG) so that despite allowing building upwards, Japan rarely feels confined.

The biggest issue then, is that this so dramatically decreases housing costs that houses actually [lose value over time](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/16/japan-reusable-housing-revolution) - it's easier to build whatever the market is demanding than it is to sell your house in hopes that it's exactly what another person desires.

Nevertheless, there seems to be an emerging critique of AB5 from the left end of the political spectrum. Vox, the publisher of the pro-AB5 article, has already fired all of their California-based freelancers: ([https://trofire.com/2020/01/10/new-california-labor-law-has-made-freelancing-nearly-impossible/](https://trofire.com/2020/01/10/new-california-labor-law-has-made-freelancing-nearly-impossible/) ). In today's under-employed economy, the choice is often between part-time underpaid work and no pay at all. Unfortunately, due to the constraints of the capitalist system, instead of complying with new regulations, companies will instead just fire their freelancers. In my mind, even though I had a family member in California who would negatively affected by this bill, I still wanted to do the research to see if this is a net negative. Indeed, even my preferred candidate for President, Bernie Sanders, is for this bill. But the problem is that large corporations like Uber, instead of complying with the law, will just skirt the law in another way- by firing their existing employees even if they can afford to pay them more. And in the process, this will just hurt small businesses and particularly creative industries who simply cannot afford to offer benefits. If, instead, we had universal healthcare,  we would not need have this conversation about employee benefits. That being said, I think Bernie Sanders made a mistake to back this law without fully reading all the details, but I still don't trust an industry-backed bill. **The exemption should be for creative writers and other true independent contractors, not for Uber drivers who have been fighting to be recognized as full employees**. However, if Uber is going to fire workers, that is also harmful. The bill in a sense doesn't go far enough: it doesn't prevent corporations from firing workers simply because they don't want to pay benefits even if it can afford it. In my mind, this bill, while nominally pro-worker and pro-union, ignores the realities of the capitalist economy today and the overwhelming power of multinational corporations. It doesn't plug all the holes",sra3fk,,d2h5ic,fiwed9j

* The outrage factory that is cable news and associated websites.
* The daily ping-pong match that is most mainstream news.

* The elevation of minor or local issues to a coverage level of major or worldwide relevance when it suits the news organization's profit model.

,">There are also arguments to include future liabilities, like Social Security, which by law cannot add to the deficit, but for which as of 2018 relies on cash infusions from the treasury to pay full benefits

This is not true, as per your source. The difference between revenue and payout comes from *interest on Treasury bonds*, not ""cash infusions"". In past years, the Social Security trust fund has run a surplus, so they put their money in Treasury bonds, which pay annual interest. In the article you linked, Brian Riedl (senior fellow at a conservative think tank) is taken to task for being disingenuous for saying that SS gets cash infusions, when in fact he's lying. Social Security isn't relying on cash infusions any more than your savings account's interest is a cash infusion. These payments are already reflected in the deficit - counting them here would artificially inflate the deficit.",Neckbeard_The_Great,,d2ac8r,ezucpvj
,"This is actually one of my favorite topics to bring up to deficit hawks.

Like all accounting, the national debt is subject to how people want to calculate it. There are a number of important items kept off the books in the calculation of the national debt, and they aren't super difficult to find. Or at least, [wikipedia nicely lists which items are exempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#Valuation_and_measurement). Finding their specific numbers might be harder but wikipedia has estimates. Among them are:

* Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations are excluded ($5 trillion in obligations)
* Unfunded obligations that include Medicare are excluded ($46 trillion in obligations)

Once all accounted for, the amount of money *the government owes to someone* comes to about $65 trillion.

My comment here to deficit hawks is that if the ballooning of debt matters, then the debt is actually much much worse than the [$22 trillion figure](https://www.usdebtclock.org/) you think it is.

But take notice of my careful wording. The national debt can be accounted for by adding up all the money that the government owes to someone. Alot of this debt is [intergovernmental loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intragovernmental_holdings), meaning the government owes itself. Under the carefully chosen wording, money moved from one hand to another hand of the same entity counts as debt.

But more important is the wording for things like Medicare. Some parts of Medicare obligations are *automatic authorized spending*. [This is the ""authorized by congress"" bullet point.](https://www.medicare.gov/about-us/how-is-medicare-funded) Meaning, these obligations need not ever raise funds. Hence, they are ""unfunded"". The government is authorized to spend into existence whatever is necessary to meet these obligations. [This is what Alan Greenspan attempts to explain to Paul Ryan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNCZHAQnfGU). In other words the fear mongering of Medicare running out of money is largely unwarranted. For the parts of Medicare that are funded through your taxes, there actually isn't anything but political will preventing abolishing that law, and just reincorporating it into the authorized spending law. Many proponents of Modern Money Theory point to this often veiled dynamic as the motivation for restructuring our spending priorities and ""funding"" important programs through simple authorized spending.

,"I question the characterization by critics of social security payouts as ""debt"" (as claimed in the OP.) It's like saying, I will have to spend $40000 to eat meals for the next ten years, so I have a massive future food ""debt"" that needs to be resolved. I don't really need to have a lump sum of $40K banked now or at any time in the future.  It's a rolling pay-as-I-go expenditure that is covered by earning eleven dollars a day, and it would be disingenuous for me to characterize it as a problematic debt situation.

It's true that if I'm putting aside only $10 a day for food, and still spending $11, I will find myself dipping into my rainy day savings and eventually run into a problem.  But that problem can be remedied at any point by either saving an extra dollar a day or or by cutting my food bill by a dollar a day.

,"1. According to [usdebtclock.org](https://usdebtclock.org) (sourced to treasury.gov), the US has almost $127 trillion in unfunded liabilities. The majority of these are debt held by the public (which includes foreign and state holdings, but excludes debt held by other Federal branches according to RCP), Federal/military pensions (plus other benefits), and Social Security+Medicare. National governments are not required to pay back their debts because of sovereign immunity (can't be sued). However, they will continue to pay their debt and other obligations because it is in their best interest (who's gonna loan you money if they know you're not gonna pay it back?). As for the other obligations, the risk is societal upheaval. If there's a generation that paid for SS, but won't get it, there's gonna be a problem. 
2. (Continuing the thought from above) Even though bondholders wouldn't ordinarily care if pensioners get what they're due, the government, through, might choose to appease pensioners over creditors (common people assert their power by voting, protesting, and possibly revolution). Credit rating agencies know this, and take it into account. An example would be when a state or municipality gets in over its head with pension liability, often due to underperforming investments or passing a new pension law.  [https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/06/27/unfunded-pension-liabilities-hurt-states-bond-rating/740514002/](https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/06/27/unfunded-pension-liabilities-hurt-states-bond-rating/740514002/) 

And also should state and municipal debt count negatively for the Federal government? I say yes, and the converse of that question is true as well. You only have to much taxing power over a given populace before they, by expressing their will through the government or other means, refuse to pay. A good credit rating agency knows this, and will take sub-national debt into account when rating the federal government, as well as taking national (and state) debt into account when rating states (and municipalities).",TotalFratMove69,,d2ac8r,ezug3gi

Furthermore, what would a president and a majority party gain from adjourning early? Theoretically they would have control of the legislative process and chamber in question -- so kicking themselves out of Congress early would be... an interesting tactic. I guess we could brainstorm a few reasons when this might be seen as a necessary last resort to stave off some political disaster, but it's hard to think of one off the top of my head.

,"This is an interesting legal theory in multiple ways. [One aspect is that government action is immune from antitrust liability](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/state_action_antitrust_immunity). This is obviously related to government action, but the actual compliance was voluntary, so it raises some interesting issues regarding deregulation that other commenters here are discussing.

I wonder, however, whether this is an attack on the Consumer Welfare Standard. One important measure of whether activity is anticompetitive is the so-called ""consumer welfare standard."" In recent decades, this standard has come to mean (put very generally) that so long as the long-term result is lower prices for consumers, behavior is not considered anti-competitive, even if it hurts the ability of small businesses to compete or results in a smaller number of big businesses in an industry (see discussion of this issue by [government officials](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1455663/welfare_standard_speech_-_cmr-wilson.pdf) and [politicians](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20181212/108774/HHRG-115-JU05-20181212-SD004.pdf) respectively).

The upside of the CWS is that it depoliticizes antitrust enforcement and makes it much simpler and more objective to judge ""good"" and ""bad"" behavior, but the downside is that it leaves out a lot of things that normal people and even politicians care about in terms of maintaining competition in the economy and providing benefits to consumers. Trump is actually part of a bi-partisan bandwagon seeking to change this standard in order to go after, in particular, big tech companies like Amazon and Facebook, which generally provide rock-bottom prices to consumers through their size, but arguably have negative effects on, for example, small businesses and consumer privacy respectively.

If the Trump administration brings a case based on a theory that voluntary compliance with these standards raises consumer prices (which it presumably would; if you could lower prices by being more environmental you wouldn't need regulations), then it could be a good opportunity for the court to start using a broader standard of consumer welfare that doesn't just look at price, but also at other consumer benefits like environmental protection. If the court did so, this would make it much easier for the Trump administration to bring antitrust lawsuits against big companies like Amazon based on allegations that they harm society or the economy in various ways.

In particular, this is a classic [moral hazard problem.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3189798)  (That is a research paper detailing the moral hazard issues specifically of Fannie and Freddie).

Given that:

1.  These are US gov't sponsored companies; and

2. The US government has previously taken them over as a bailout to people whom they owed money.  

It is not possible for the US to credibly assure they will not be subject to a future bailout.

Because the GSEs are in effect government guaranteed, they operate at a deeply unfair status vis a vis the rest of the market.  They can borrow more cheaply.  For example [there is a consistent 4+ percent spread between corporate bonds on average and US Treasury bonds.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2)

In contrast [mortgage backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddie](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr674.pdf) do not offer a premium except for the risk involved in prepayment.  

While mortgage backed securities might be expected to have lower risk premia than US treasury debt, having no risk premium  for default is only explainable in my opinion by the government guarantee.

Given the government guarantee would continue, in effect it would be a giveaway of government subsidies to whoever buys Fannie and Freddie debt or stock.  They would be in a ""heads I win, tails you lose"" situation, where if things went well, they could get better than market returns on their investments, but if things went badly, the government would bail them out.^1

^1 The subsidy is different to bond buyers vs shareholders.  The bond buyers would be getting the immediate subsidy in a zero risk bond, but that would mostly be lost to the yield being pushed to T-bill levels plus prepayment risk.

,"I'll add to the discussion by providing some background on the term 'inciting violence' and why it's of particular importance in this context. 

Inciting violence is a pretty high bar to reach, you have to be actively calling for violence directly.

To illustrate, let's take a look at the Supreme Court case NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886 (1982) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP_v._Claiborne_Hardware_Co.]

From the Wikipedia summary:

>In March 1966, black citizens of Port Gibson, Mississippi, and other areas of Claiborne County presented white elected officials with a list of particularized demands for racial equality and racial integration. After not receiving a satisfactory response, at a local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) meeting at the First Baptist Church, several hundred black persons voted to place a boycott on white merchants in the area.[3] In February 1967, Port Gibson employed its first black police officer and the boycott was lifted. However, in 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, and a young black man, Roosevelt Jackson was shot and killed by two Port Gibson police officers.[3] On April 19, 1968, the field secretary of the NAACP for Mississippi, Charles Evers, led a march to the Claiborne County courthouse and demanded that the entire Port Jefferson police force be discharged.[3] When the demand was not met, the boycott on the merchants was reimposed. On April 21, Evers made a speech in which he said, ""If we catch any of you going into these racist stores, we're going to break your damn neck.""[3] During the boycott, individuals known as ""Black Hats"" or ""Deacons"" stood outside stores to identify blacks who broke the boycott.[3] The names of those who were identified were published in a black newspaper and the names were read aloud at NAACP meetings.[3] In at least 10 instances, blacks who violated the boycott experienced instances of violence, including shots fired into their homes, bricks thrown through their windshields, and tires on their cars slashed.[3][4] ... the court [found] no grounds for incitation of violence

If the statement ""If we catch any of you going into these racist stores, we're going to break your damn neck"" isn't ""inciting violence"", and if publishing the names of people who broke the boycott in newspapers and reading their names aloud at meetings isn't ""inciting violence"" -- even when 10 of the people on that list ""experienced instances of violence, including shots fired into their homes, bricks thrown through their windshields, and tires on their cars slashed"", the NRA publishing an ad with targets over certain politicians isn't inciting violence.

Politicians and people like to throw around the term ""inciting violence"" haphazardly, and it's dangerous. Speech that incites violence is not protected by the 1st Amendment and therefore can be subjected to censorship. If we could call vaguely threatening or offensive things ""inciting violence"" and therefore censor them, the 1st Amendment would be eviscerated. Remember, the 1st Amendment exists not to protect the speech we agree with (and therefore wouldn't want to censor) but to protect the speech we disagree with most. This is, however, what the politicians in SF are trying to do.  If they can successfully argue that the NRA's speech is 'inciting violence', they can censor them. 

I used Claiborne to illustrate not only the current legal view of the 1st Amendment, but also why the 1st Amendment exists. The Supreme Court demonstrated both their great wisdom and the reason why they're so important in Claiborne and in subsequent 1st Amendment jurisprudence. They saw what the Mississippi Supreme Court, and other lower courts, did not. Circumscribing fundamental rights in the interest of short-term political exigencies is the wrong choice. The Court understood that even slightly limiting the 1st Amendment's protections, even in the face of indirectly related incidents of actual violence, would lead to horrific long-term results.

From 1966-68, when the events giving rise to this case occurred, the NAACP and the people pushing for civil rights were in the minority. Their views were not popular (initially) and those who disagreed with them used every means at their disposal to try and censor their speech - including claiming that it incited violence. In Claiborne, it was racists in the south trying to preserve segregation by any means. Now it's gun control advocates trying to do the same to the NRA and other politicians trying to label speech as ""inciting violence"" to censor their opposition.

In light of this, I think that there's only one conclusion which fits in with this information: if you're happy that we live in a country where the NAACP and the Civil Rights movement more broadly received 1st Amendment protections against the racists in the south who wanted to censor them, we only get to that result when we adopt a standard that also covers the NRA's speech today. The 1st Amendment exists to protect minority viewpoints in the most important political discussions (which later lead to them becoming majority viewpoints), from abolition to civil rights. Consequently, it also protects the speech of Nazis, racists, and people whose views we believe to be morally reprehensible/evil (for some, that's the NRA). Put more simply, the 1st Amendment only works when it protects both the speech we like and the speech we hate, we should take a step back and think about the long-term before we fall into the trap of the ends justifying the means.",Beast66,,czskjb,ez5uiej
,"The quote in question appears to come from the ""Immigration and Nationality Act"" from 1952, specifically, *section 8 USC 1182: Inadmissible aliens*.

>(iii) ""Terrorist activity"" defined
As used in this chapter, the term ""terrorist activity"" means any activity which is unlawful under the laws of the place where it is committed (or which, if it had been committed in the United States, would be unlawful under the laws of the United States or any State) and which involves any of the following:

>(I) The highjacking or sabotage of any conveyance (including an aircraft, vessel, or vehicle).

>(II) The seizing or detaining, and threatening to kill, injure, or continue to detain, another individual in order to compel a third person (including a governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the individual seized or detained.

>(III) A violent attack upon an internationally protected person (as defined in section 1116(b)(4) of title 18) or upon the liberty of such a person.

>(IV) An assassination.

>(V) The use of any-

>(a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or

>**(b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.**

>(VI) A threat, attempt, or conspiracy to do any of the foregoing.

Your link to U.S. code is probably a more common and effective definition of a terrorist organization, as opposed to the disqualifications list applied to individual non-citizens.

The NRA promotional materials cited by SF council could be argued to be presented in jest (bumper stickers provide decent context for this).  While the SF council is making an interesting political point, and it may even influence the marketing tactics of the NRA, it's hard to imagine a ""domestic terrorist organization"" designation holding water in any other legal context.

As I understand it, the NRA's [explicit goals](https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/) are to encourage responsible gun ownership, including marksmanship, security, etc.  I think you could also argue their implicit goals are around [selling more guns](https://www.newsweek.com/nra-walmart-gun-ammunition-sales-1457520).  While guns are a force multiplier, neither of those goals involve directly inciting violence.",keylimesoda,,czskjb,ez0seye
,"These accusations are really shaky. For example:

> * cites ""an epidemic of gun violence""

The gun violence rate really shouldn't determine whether the NRA is considered a terrorist organization. It seems they're trying to take all gun crime and pin responsibility to the NRA, as if the NRA is encouraging people to kill their spouses or commit drive-by shootings. 

In fact, that's *exactly* the accusation they're making. Per the resolution:

> [The NRA] through its advocacy has armed those individuals who would and have committed acts of terrorism.

I'm not sure how this accusation could be quantifiable. Did the SF Board of Supervisors gather data on how many gun violence perpetrators are card-carrying NRA members? People can obtain and use weapons without the NRA ever being involved. 

---

That aside, the really weak accusation is this one:

> * The NRA [works to] incite gun owners to acts of violence

How? What could this possibly mean? Is there any more information on what they meant? 

As it stands, that's just a terrible accusation. There's no definition, no justification, no examples, nothing. As a gun owner myself, I must have missed the memo from the NRA telling me to commit senseless violence. 

---

Also, it should be mentioned that the SF Board of Supervisors is far from unbiased, and are not the right people to be deciding labels for the NRA. Per the source:

>District 2 Supervisor Catherine Stefani wrote the resolution and shared her thoughts on the NRA with KTVU. ""The NRA has it coming to them,"" she said. ""And I will do everything I possibly can to call them out on what they are, which is a domestic terrorist organization.""

Any government group trying to objectively categorize the NRA should not be hellbent on ""doing everything possible to call them out."" It's easy to argue they knew what their verdict was from the beginning, and then tried to string together arguments to rationalize their perspective.

This has just been a trend lately with San Francisco Board of Supervisors on relabeling and changing terminology.

> economists almost unanimously view rent controls as harmful and self-defeating. A recent study of San Francisco by Rebecca Diamond and others at Stanford University found that rent control reduces the supply of rental housing, because landlords sell properties for owner-occupation instead.

,"The pros are: renters that can find apartments will have cheaper rent in buildings that have already been built

The cons are: a lot of medium and long term effects on housing supply, housing shortages, black market payments to secure housing, perverse incentives for landlords (they used to want you to stay, now they want you out)

Something that's true for any market where there's a price ceiling that falls below the natural market price: there will be a shortage of supply and then supply gets rationed by non-price mechanisms (queues or knowing people)

edit: for the Automoderator, here's an article from Bloomberg

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-01-18/yup-rent-control-does-more-harm-than-good",oilman81,,cyz6lz,eywvkgo
,[Freakeconomics](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/rent-control/) has a good episode on rent control. My personal opinion is it is populist glad handing to get elected. Practically it works short term but mid/long term it creates more problems than it solves.,superfudging,,cyz6lz,eywve23
,"To start, I'm a property manager and I managed rent controlled properties in Santa Monica, CA, which has some of the strictest rent control mandates and provisions in the state.

Rent control (I'll call these properties ""RSO property"" named for the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance), by philosophy, is not wholly bad: the idea of getting priced out of your home, or even your entire neighborhood, is not a good thing.  As a personal experience, my 2750/mo. 2x2 apartment (not RSO) went up to $3420/mo. in one rent increase. I got the unit on a special and then it was ""raised to market"" upon lease renewal. A $670 increase in rent is nearly a 25% increase and would have necessitated a raise at my job of over $8000/yr. just to break even on the rent increase. This priced me out of that apartment and forced me to move. Rent control, in general, seeks to alleviate this issue for renters, just as Prop 13 does for homeowners.

([Prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13), for those not from CA, is a ""freeze"" on property taxes. Taxes are assessed at time of purchase and then not reassessed until sale. There's room for increasing the taxes by a ceiling of 2%, indexed to the inflation rate.)

So while the RSO and other forms of rent control can help an individual, potentially, in the short term by limiting the likelihood they will be priced out of their current home, as I was, the issue comes when looking at the market where the reality, especially in areas of high property demand with low property supply, such as pretty much every urban, or suburban, area of CA is that rent control also puts a [massive halt on unit availability](https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=econ_honproj). With little to no mobility for those seeking housing, you never open up properties to have new renters. Not to advocate for landlords, but in some areas, if a building had no turnover for 3 years, a property's budget sheet can enter the negatives, leading to deferred maintenance and other issues. As is, except in highly transient neighborhoods, you see people staying in rent controlled units for 5+ years, as opposed to 2+ years at buildings with market units.

So what's happened in Santa Monica? Aside from corporate owners or real estate investors looking to do something with the land as opposed to the building, people have stopped buying multifamily buildings. When you sell a tenant-occupied building, under state law, the lease transfers. RSO buildings also require different leases than non-RSO buildings, as RSO tenants have more rights with regard to being told they need to leave. You can't merely issue a 60-day notice of non-renewal to an RSO tenant like you can a non-RSO tenant, and those leases stay in place if a new owner buys the building. This makes buying RSO buildings ([which is any building constructed before April 10, 1979](https://www.smgov.net/Overview.aspx)) **extremely** unattractive. Why would anyone buy a building where not only is the income not covering the expenses of the building, but you also can't raise your income generation to cover those expenses by law? Unless you're willing to go to the extreme of buying out the leases of every tenant and then demolishing and reconstructing the building (which isn't my area of expertise), RSO buildings are a worthless investment. This depreciates the building and in turn depreciates the neighborhood. It leads to deferred maintenance, no upgrades, often poor security, understaffing (if a large property) and at the extremes, slumlord-like landlording practices (which then lead to or accelerate the previous issues as well).

The alternative, which is just as bad (or worse, depending on who you're asking) is that the buildings are purchased and then sold off as condos. This happened to the building I currently manage ([though this occured before I was born, it was done in response to the impending passing of the original RSO legislation which would have made this building, when it was apartments, a RSO building](https://www.smgov.net/departments/council/agendas/1999/19990202/s1999020211-A.html) \-- see the ""Birth of the Ellis Act"" section). Under [the Ellis Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&division=7.&title=1.&part=&chapter=12.75), landlords are able to evict their tenants, even from a rent controlled building, if they are removing the building from the rental market (see 7060.7 in the linked statute). The building I manage is over 100 units in a highrise. The displacement of 100 families has significant economic impact, and more likely than not, those who are renting cannot afford to purchase their own unit during a conversion. RSO legislation can have, while not immediate, a profound impact on the displacement of families years down the line from its initial passing. You can see from the [latest statement from the City of Santa Monica](https://www.smgov.net/rentcontrol/), that over 2000 units were ""Ellis Withdrawals"" in 2018 alone, displacing that many families/tenants. Ellis Withdrawals are becoming increasingly common in LA, [San Francisco](http://antievictionmappingproject.net/ellis.html) and other municipalities.

As other commenters have noted as well, rent control does not exclusively help low-income families. One of the buildings I managed was on Ocean Ave. in Santa Monica. This is practically beachfront property, walking distance to the famous Santa Monica Pier. There were residents in the building making six-figure incomes but paying $800/mo. in rent for a 12th floor beachfront balcony apartment because they started renting in the early 1990s. This is, I'd dare to say, antithetical to the point of rent control.

The best way to drive down pricing for renters is to pass legislation that encourages the increase of supply. Right now, in LA, it's not worth constructing economical apartments. [Due to parking and greenspace requirements, earthquake resistance and bureaucratic red tape](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/6lvwh4/im_an_architect_in_la_specializing_in_multifamily/), it's too expensive per square foot of living space to create low-income or income stable housing. [Almost all new housing is ""luxury housing""](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2019/04/12/whats-behind-southern-californias-housing-crunch), with rents of $3/sqft/mo. or higher (that's $3000/mo for a 1000 sqft. 2x2) which does nothing to alleviate a contracting housing supply. Alternatively, if a subsidy of sorts is in place, [it should be through the renewals of Section 8 contracts and expansion of low income housing programs](https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=econ_honproj).

,"In the short term there will be benefits to renters. In the long-term everyone suffers including some renters (the ones that can't find rental units).

Rent controls are a political tool to buy votes with the uninformed public and aren't actually good at reducing rents or improving the lives of people in society.

The best solution that is backed by economics to increase affordability for renters is to implement a state wide (better if it's federal) land value tax on all land equally (not treating residential or commercial or agriculture, or occupied and not occupied differently etc...) at a high level such as say 5-15% the value of the land per year. Use all tax revenue from this land value tax to reduce income taxes. A streamlined process where the municipalities end all property taxes but receive a portion of the state/federal land value tax would also be better but not required.

Furthermore, zoning regulations need to be relaxed immensely such that anyone can build anything anywhere they want unless it doesn't meet environmental and/or safety regulations. These regulations need to be as relaxed as possible to balance cost versus people's quality of life.

Finally, any municipal taxes that are specific to new developments need to be removed or reduced and rolled up into the general land value taxes. Having new development specific costs reduces development and increases the costs of new development which reduces supply and increases overall cost of renting/living. It's much better to tax the wealth of those who already have it (land owners) then redistribute that wealth to people who don't yet own any wealth (renters or new home buyers, generally).

,"There's strong evidence that rent controls are harmful. Economic theory also predicts inefficiencies in rent control. The discussion goes back to 1946, when Friedman and Stigler wrote a paper about the inefficiencies of housing under rent control.

Empirical evidence agrees fairly well with the theory. Edward Glaeser, an expert on urban economics, estimated that rent control in NYC has a cost of, approximately, 200  dollars per apartment [(Glaeser and Luttmer, 1997)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w6220). The issue of rent control is that it produces misallocation of space in cities, considering space is a scarce resource. It stops the urban development of the city and the inherent dynamics of urban areas. People who would otherwise move of an apartment will avoid doing it under rent control, as the value of the space sky rockets.

Even if you rent control, I would speculate that seems like its going to make those areas look more like ""Escape from LA"" movie or regard the properties more over time with negative connotations like section 8 assistance. The wealthy and the 'haves' will find a new way to segregate themselves. It seems likely to be ineffective for the very compelling arguments listed here already - black market payments, knowing people, and in general dis ingenuousness of people skirting the letter of the law.

I would say the road to fixing housing costs there, and as the local residents already know - that's not a short road, would be to abolish the heavy amount of tax cuts given out and let all the states share both the benefits and burden of tech companies being around.

Cons: in the long term: 
a) rent prices for everyone else (i.e. new tenants) increase because the property has increased in value (or, if recently purchased, was purchased for a high price) and the owner wants to get a return on their investment but can only get that return by charging higher rents to new tenants rather than splitting the increase among all tenants (https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa274.pdf); 

b) housing supply is lower because there's less incentive to build housing due to the lower expected return, increasing rent prices (Writing in 1946, economists Milton Friedman and George J. Stigler said: ""Rent ceilings, therefore, cause haphazard and arbitrary allocation of space, inefficient use of space, retardation of new construction and indefinite continuance of rent ceilings, or subsidization of new construction and a future depression in residential building.""[34] Although those paying lower than market rent are ""protected,"" most economists argue that newer residents actually pay higher rent due to reduced supply. https://fee.org/resources/roofs-or-ceilings-the-current-housing-problem/); 

c) building improvements, renovations, and maintenance are neglected because the landlord isn't making enough money to make it worthwhile/can't charge more in rent to offset the cost (See above).

,"Reading the policy memo, it doesn't just apply to government employees that adopt.

>Numerous statutory provisions related to citizenship require applicants or their U.S. citizen parents to “reside” or to have had a “residence” in a particular location. USCIS is updating the Policy Manual to better define residence and clarify the distinction between U.S. residence and physical presence. In addition, USCIS is updating its policy regarding children of U.S. government employees and U.S. armed forces members employed or stationed outside the United States to explain that they are not considered to be “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquiring citizenship under INA 320. 

Specifically, the policy removes an automatic path to citizenship using provisions of INA 320. Now, government employees who give birth, legitimize, or adopt while overseas will have to apply for citizenship for the child under the provisions of 332.

But, in my personal opinion, the following passage is the most disturbing.

>Effective October 29, 2019, children residing abroad with their U.S. citizen parents who are U.S. government employees or members of the U.S. armed forces stationed abroad are not considered to be residing in the United States for acquisition of citizenship. Similarly, leave taken in the United States while stationed abroad is not considered residing in the United States even if the person is staying in property he or she owns. 

If a government employee stationed overseas takes leave, returns to the US, and takes up residence in a property they own, children born or adopted during this period will need to apply for US citizenship.

Additionally, there's this gem.

>A person does not need to own or rent property in the United States in order to establish residence.

I suppose we'll have to wait and see if use of that passage is limited to these specific policies, or if a larger adoption of that statement applies.

In summary, government employees who give birth, legitimize, or adopt a child while residing overseas will now be required to apply for citizenship for their child.

Edit: As pointed out by /u/cciv, children born overseas would still fall under INA 301. I just didn't dig deep enough into the footnotes of the policy to understand that.

Edit 2: INA 301 details *who* is eligible for citizenship, while INA 320/322 provide the process that *grants* that citizenship.

>Second, considering children who are living outside of the United States to be “residing in the United States” conflicts with the definition of “residence” at INA 101(a)(33), which defines “residence” as a person’s “principal, actual dwelling place in fact.”

>Third, considering these children to be “residing in the United States” is at odds with INA 322(d), which was enacted in 2008,16 4 years after USCIS issued policy guidance on the topic. When Congress enacted INA 322(d), it provided for special procedures in cases involving the naturalization of “a child of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who is authorized to accompany such member and reside abroad with the member pursuant to the member's official orders, and is so accompanying and residing with the member.” Congress placed this provision under INA 322, which applies only to children “residing outside of the United States.” It did not provide similar language for such children to acquire citizenship under INA 320.

>Furthermore, in the same legislation, Congress also explicitly provided that spouses of U.S. armed forces members who reside outside of the United States due to the member’s official orders are considered to be residing in the United States for naturalization purposes.17 The fact that no similar provision was included for children of U.S. armed forces members in the acquisition of citizenship context is significant.18

>Finally, the prior USCIS policy produced confusion in several respects. First, it may have resulted in inconsistent adjudications by USCIS officers adjudicating applications for certificates of citizenship, and U.S. Department of State (DOS) consular officers adjudicating passport applications. DOS has interpreted INA 320 to apply solely to children who are physically in the United States and does not recognize an exception by policy for children of U.S. military and U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States.19

>In addition, the policy resulted in confusion as to the date a child acquired U.S. citizenship, depending on what form the parent (a U.S. government employee or U.S. armed forces member employed or stationed outside of the United States) used: Form N-600K would result in naturalization proceedings under INA 322, while Form N-600 would result in automatic acquisition of citizenship under INA 320. Children who acquire U.S. citizenship automatically are citizens as of the date on which they meet all eligibility criteria under INA 320, but children who seek naturalization under INA 322 become citizens upon taking and subscribing to the oath of allegiance (or upon approval of the application if the oath is waived).
Under USCIS’ prior policy guidance, a child of a U.S. government employee or U.S. armed forces member who was employed or stationed outside of the United States could meet all of the eligibility criteria for acquiring citizenship under INA 320 while residing outside of the United States, but still seek to naturalize under INA 322. In such a case, the date on which the child became a citizen would have been unclear.

>For all these reasons, USCIS rescinded the prior USCIS policy permitting children of U.S. government employees and U.S. armed forces members stationed outside of the United States to be considered “residing in” the United States.

The Queen did not suspend Parliament. The Royal family does not take part in politics, The Queen is essentially a ceremonial rubber stamp. *It was Boris Johnson who suspended Parliament*

Here's his letter regarding plans to shutdown parliament https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/28/read-boris-johnsons-letter-british-lawmakers-about-his-plans-shut-down-parliament/",stamatt45,,cwpsyy,eyf0fp8
,">**Who will be in charge of the government and its decisions while Parliament is suspended?**

The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson (unless he is replaced after a vote of no confidence, then it would be the new Prime Minister).

The executive offices of the government [do not dissolve or go on hiatus](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/general/dissolution/#jump-link-1) when Parliament is dissolved (as they would be for an election) or prorogued (which is what just was announced.)

>**Are these powers given to an individual, to a committee, or anything more broad?**

The [Prime Minister and Cabinet](https://www.gov.uk/government/how-government-works) run the government during a prorogation as they would at any other time.

If Parliament withdrew confidence in the Johnson ministry, then the [caretaker conventions](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpolcon/1023/102306.htm) would apply to somewhat limit his ability to undertake new policy initiatives.

Also as Prime Minister he cannot effect changes in the law; only Parliament can do that.  So the statute books are unchanged until Parliament comes back.

>**How long does the suspension of Parliament last?**

This prorogation lasts [approximately five weeks.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48936711)  A prorogation can be as short or as long as the Prime Minister likes, except that an indefinitely long prorogation could result in either the Parliament dissolving by [efflux of time](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2975404) or result in a [loss of supply,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_supply) which might result in the Prime Minister being dismissed as [happened in Australia once.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis)

However there are a few sitting days before the prorogation where things could happen to prevent this prorogation.

>**Has this ever happened before to set a precedent that we could expect to be followed?**

The closest precedent I believe is the [2008 Canadian constitutional crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute) where Prime Minister Harper prorogued Parliament to avoid an expected defeat on his budget.  Harper was allowed to have his prorogation. [This is an excellent and funny video explainer on that incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7JkfgQImA) as a second source.

>**How could this most likely affect the outcome of Brexit with regards to creating a deal or having a no-deal Brexit?**

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

But more seriously, [this article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/boris-johnson-brexit-extreme-measures) has a good rundown of the broader strategy this is a part of, which is essentially to run out the clock to prevent Parliament voting to stop a no deal crash out.

>**What are the constitutional concerns relating to the Queen's suspension of Parliament?**

There is a role of the Queen as a last resort defender of the constitutional order against unconstitutional or blatantly illegal government policy.  The Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow referred to this prorogation as [""a constitutional outrage.""](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/28/boris-johnsons-move-to-prorogue-parliament-a-constitutional-outrage-says-speaker)

My suspicion is that if the prorogation had not been after a brief return of the Commons which would allow it to vote no confidence in Mr. Johnson's government, it might not have been allowed by the Queen.  But there will be [a few sitting days in early September](https://www.itv.com/news/2019-08-28/brexit-timeline-prorogation-suspending-parliament-no-deal-brexit-what-happens-now/) when the Commons would be able to vote no confidence in the Johnson government, which I think assuaged that.",huadpe,,cwpsyy,eyfca8c
,"As a Canadian, we've been through this before here and it has a pretty sad end. Parliament is often prorogued or in recess for longer periods of time here (months rather than weeks/days like in the UK) but there was a situation about a decade ago where it was done during a similarly intense period of time.

In 2008, the recently elected minority Conservative government faced being defeated after the three opposition parties decided to team up to form a coalition because of the Conservative's lackluster response to the 2008 economic crisis and a decision to cut political party subsidies. The motion of no-confidence specifically called for the Governor General (the Queen's representative in Canada) to call upon the opposition to form the government rather than call a new election. With no options, the PM went to the Governor General to request that Parliament be prorogued to stop the opposition from passing this motion. In an unusual move, the Prime Minister was kept waiting for hours at the Governor General's residence after the request was made as she consulted with legal experts. The end result was her acceptance of prorogation but with a time limit of 6 weeks (the PM likely wanted a prorogation that he could end at his whim possibly stretching for months).

The move sparked protests and letters from Opposition leaders to the Governor General (just like what is happening now) but in the end, the opposition coalition fell apart during the 6 weeks (which is possible with a divided opposition in the UK right now) and Canada had a Conservative government until 2015 -- albeit, the government did reinstate the political subsidy for a short while and delivered an economic stimulus program which they originally fought against. Though the Governor General's decision to time limit the prorogation was important, her decision to bend the knee to the Prime Minister's request even though it was absolutely clear to anyone paying attention that he didn't enjoy the confidence of Parliament anymore resulted in a further eroding of Parliament's place in Canada.

A few years later, the PM got and was granted and non-time limited prorogation which he requested due to an ongoing controversy about the Afghanistan war. Again (less sizeable) protests but nothing else. Provincial premiers have since called prorogations lasting almost half a year without significant backlash.

If the Governor General had made a different decision and set a new precedent to defend Parliament against the executive, I think the relations between our different branches of government would be more balanced today. It would also set up the Governor General as not merely the pawn of the Prime Minister but as a defender of Parliament -- which is what a lot of monarchists argue. I fear the UK is going to go down this same slippery path because of the decision made today. Unfortunately, the Queen likely felt even less empowered to take a stand than the Canadian Governor General did since at least the Governor General is appointed by a Prime Minister who had a democratic mandate. If the opposition stay strong and fight against this more effectively than Canada's, possibly this outcome can be averted.

,"Before I answer your questions I want to briefly address how the whole thing works with Parliament and the Queen. 

People vote for a Member of Parliament (MP) to represent their region. The Queen chooses a member of parliament to be the Prime Minister (PM). She has the power to choose anyone, though in practice she will only choose the leader of the largest party in parliament. 

The Queen has the power to suspend and dissolve parliament at will, however in practice she will only do this ""on the advise if the PM,"" meaning only when the PM asks. In this case Boris Johnson has requested she suspend parliament for five weeks so he can prepare his legislative agenda (officially, that's his reason). This is normal, though not usually for that long (and not under more extreme circumstances such as Brexit), most PMs do this when they become PM. 

Now for your questions:

>Who will be in charge of the government and its decisions while Parliament is suspended? Are these powers given to an individual, to a committee, or anything more broad?

Boris Johnson is still in charge of the government, however nothing is done until the suspension ends. No new legislation is brought forth, no debates or votes are held, etc. 

>How long does the suspension of Parliament last?

Depends on how long the Prime Minister requests. In this case it's set to be suspended for five weeks. Here in Ontario our premiere has currently suspended parliament for five months. 

>Has this ever happened before to set a precedent that we could expect to be followed?

As I've said before, it's happened loads of times for many different reasons.

>How could this most likely affect the outcome of Brexit with regards to creating a deal or having a no-deal Brexit? (I imagine this is closely related to the first question of who will be in charge now)

It is likely to increase the chances of a no-deal Brexit due to the shortened time that negotiations with the EU are able to be carried out in, and the shortened time for debate on the issue in Parliament. 

>What are the constitutional concerns relating to the Queen's suspension of Parliament?

Close to none. She doesn't exercise her power independently, only doing so on the advise of the prime minister. If she were to do otherwise it would cause quite an uproar. See the [King-Byng Crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%E2%80%93Byng_affair) that occurred in Canada for a taste of the mess that would cause (the Governor General is the Queen's representative in Canada and fulfills her role in the country). 

With this suspension of Parliament, it was done at the advise of the Prime Minister as usual. However, there are great concerns about the effect this could have on the outcome of Brexit, with large amounts of the public and Parliament disagreeing with Boris Johnson's decision to have Parliament suspended. So, this is a time when the Queen could have possibly reasonably denied the PM's request, but evidently she didn't see it as the time to do so.",Melon_Cooler,,cwpsyy,eygdmij

,"As a former senior civil servant in a Westminster style democracy, I will respond to the second part of your question ie. who will be in charge of Government.

Essentially the legislature has two purposes, to table, debate and pass (or not) legislation, and to control the budget.  The areas to which these responsibilities are divided are usually divided into ministries for example, health, education, environment, agriculture etc.  Each ministry will have a Minister, and elected official responsible and answering to the head of government.  They also have a deputy minister who is appointed, not elected, who answers to the deputy to the head of state.

In the event of a parlimentary shutdown, the deputy ministers take over the running of government except they cannot pass legislation and they cannot pass any new budgets.  In the event of national emergency, legislation will exist allowing the disbursement of contingencies.

The very first section makes me think that, yes, the President has the power to do something like this, but, no, he doesn't in this situation as far as I am aware. He must first declare a state of national emergency and there must be an ""unusual and extraordinary threat,"" and I'm not sure if a trade war really qualifies.

> (a) Any authority granted to the President by section 1702 of this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.
> 
> (b) The authorities granted to the President by section 1702 of this title may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared for purposes of this chapter and may not be exercised for any other purpose.

I do not know if ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" is a defined term elsewhere.

National emergencies are covered under the previous chapter, [USC 50 §§ 1601-1651](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-34). Under § 1622, it looks like the President can declare and terminate national emergencies, and Congress can terminate them as well. Note that the President is also *explicitly* required to specify exactly which emergency powers he is going to exercise (50 USC § 1631).",da_chicken,,cvbghy,ey3a01t
,">What precedent, if any, supports Trump's position that POTUS can use a national emergency declaration to regulate and compel international trade? Or are there any precedents against the view?

The president can [declare a national emergency to](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1702) create tariffs, block or prohibit transactions, confiscate property, or freeze assets. So, there are certainly ways the president can punish companies who don't do what he says. On the other hand, there is no way for the US government to directly compel a company to do something in another country. It's not in the law and there's just no mechanism for it. It's not like you can send the Chinese police after these companies, and you obviously can't send American police into China. 

>What is the legal process by which an administration executes that law's provisions?

I think this hits the nail on the head. There is no legal process to directly do what the president is saying, but he could (for example) declare a national emergency and freeze the assets of all US companies who are still in China in January 2021. 

>In light of the fact that China contributes billions to the earnings of US corporations like Apple, how could US firms challenge Trump's supposed legal authority if he does execute the order?

Challenges to other national emergencies have gone through the US court system, they would just sue like anyone else.

>What can Congress and the courts do to stop Trump from attempting the sweeping order on trade?

The Supreme Court especially has been deferential to the president's ability to regulate international relations so I don't know that they *would* but they *could* say that it isn't a real national emergency, set some parameters for what constitutes a 'real' national emergency, and nullify the order. 

Congress is the one that passed the law allowing the president to do anything with international tariffs or trade, it's not in [Article 2 of the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution). If they passed a law with veto-proof majorities saying that the president can't do any tariffs or freeze assets without their express permission, it would be constitutional.",nemoomen,,cvbghy,ey3e0fg
,"I'm going to focus primarily on the first question posed in this post. Before I get started, I think this statement by u/highresthought in the thread is especially pertinent to this discussion:

>Whether you disagree with trump using those powers or not, is totally irrelevant to whether he has the authority to use those powers. 

That being said, the President has invoked a National Emergency in situations involving trade [eight times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States). One of these is still in effect - specifically, EO 13222. This is essentially a national emergency which invokes presidential authority to control trade in matters related to national security as a continuance of the [Arms Control Act of 1979](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-39) to be regulated by the Executive Branch. As I understand it, it's one of the main barriers of entry that China faces to the US arms market. Five of the other trade related EO are also continuations of the Arms Control Act of 1979 

Interestingly, this was amended by EO 13637 which delegated the act to the Secretary of State. However, according to the [White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/text-notice-president-speaker-house-representatives-president-senate/):

>Because the Congress has not renewed the Export Administration Act, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2018.  Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622 (d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222, as amended by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013. 

Basically, the President/Secretary of State (and further delegates, if you read the amendments) are able to unilaterally regulate and penalize actors who violate the Arms Export Act of 1979. However, do note that all these amendments are allowed because the power of delegation and for reasons of national security, and that [IEEPA](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:50%20section:1701%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title50-section1701)&f=treesort&edition=prelim&num=0&jumpTo=true),

Thus, this deals with the *Export* factor of National Emergencies. Under current law, the Executive Branch, primarily delegating authority (through  to the Secretary of State/Secretary of Defense, and thus doesn't really apply to regulating domestic trade but enforcing the 1979 AEA, specifically in U.S.C. 22, Ch. 38/39.

On the import side, we have EO 13194, the [""Blood Diamonds""](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/01/23/01-2140/prohibiting-the-importation-of-rough-diamonds-from-sierra-leone) resolution, which specifically barred the import of illegally obtained diamonds from Sierra Leone. I encourage you to read it, because it uses language that (1) qualifies the reason of the order from an International agreed reason ([UN Resolution 1306](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1306))  (2) offers a legal alternative for the issue (importing only from verified legal vendors), and (3) is issued based on an existing US legal framework, [U.S.C. 287c](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/287c). 

Now, let's get back to the question: ""Can the President Order Firms to Leave China?""

Not *really,* but... *technically,* I see there being wiggle room here. First, the legal framework under which Trump imposes tariffs is largely based on the [1917 Trading With the Enemy Act](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/8/17097206/trump-tariffs-congress), among other reasons. But, Trump hasn't declared a national emergency related to Chinese trade. He *almost* issued an IEEPA, but[raised tariffs on Mexico anyway](https://www.lawfareblog.com/legal-authority-behind-trumps-new-tariffs-mexico) due to the aforementioned law. 

Second, [U.S.C. Ch. 77 § 6983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/6983) (Prohibiting relating to human rights abuses), used in conjunction with a UN Human Rights Council Resolution, could theoretically work as a framework to forming a similar ban on certain imports. EO 13194 contains an interesting section:

>The prohibition in section 1 of this order shall not apply to the importation of rough diamonds controlled through the Certificate of Origin regime of the Government of Sierra Leone. 

Basically, according to my reasoning, you could theoretically issue an EO related to a violation of U.S.C. Ch. 77 § 6983 if there is ever a UNHRC resolution, and then use a similar clause that verifies that China is taking steps through an external process to promote equitable trade. I'm going to be the first to admit that this is a *massive* leap of legal judgment and creativity - this is purely theoretical.

As mentioned earlier, the executive authority to unilaterally control trade is purely oriented around National Security. But, to label trade with China as a threat to national security under U.S.C. 22 Ch. 38/39 and regulate it through import/export control is paradoxical because that the trade relationship itself is a threat to national security could result in bizarre things such as penalizing Apple for Violating U.S.C. 22, Ch. 38/39 as pertinent to the 1979 AEA, which is just totally ridiculous.

> I don't understand how even Trump can do what he wants to do...the president does not have the power of the purse and can't allocate money to be spent.

The political messaging is a lot different from the actual policy of this ~~bill~~ order. 

Trump is trying to make it appear that he's wiping out student debt for disabled vets with one victorious stroke of the pen because that makes him sound like a hero who is plowing through congressional funding to get stuff done.

You're correct in assuming that if this was true, it would indeed exceed his powers as president and usurp congress' power of the purse.

The truth of the matter: ***congress already allocated funds to eliminate this debt almost 2 years ago.***

So what does this really do? We're changing the debt forgiveness to an opt-out program instead of an opt-in. This eliminates the need for guys who are seriously disabled, often times blind or missing limbs or with brain damage that can really struggle filling out paperwork without assistance, to fill out paperwork. This gets a lot more people involved with the program and cuts down on the costs of administering it because now we only have to process paperwork from the small percentage of people who say ""you know what, I'd rather pay that debt out of pocket"".

So this is basically an example of the president stepping in to fix a dysfunctional process created by congress, right? Wrong. Congress allocated money to the Department of Education to forgive these debts. The Department of Education is part of the executive branch, so it is up to the President and Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, to implement that program.

When it came out that despite knowing exactly who these people are, exactly what their debts are (these are service guys on the GI bill, who have filled out a FAFSA, they're in debt to sallie fucking mae, we know everything we need to know) that we need them to fill out paperwork and turn it in on time, despite the fact that many of these people literally don't have hands to hold a pen or legs to walk to the mailbox, [bipartisan calls for the administration to change it's process started over a year and a half ago](https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-portman-coons-urge-administration-to-immediately-discharge-outstanding-loans-for-families-suffering-from-childs-death-or-permanent-disability) to change policy and [the attorneys general of 47 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/attorneys-general-devos-cancel-debt-disabled-veterans-1472656) signed a letter asking for this a few months back.

Did this have to wait 2 years to be handles? I can't see why. The administration had actively pushed back against this for years saying ""there are long-term impacts we want all veterans to have the chance to consider before their loans are discharged."". Yeah right, they need to consider how having debt discharged could negatively impact them long term... 

Was it necessary to have all the pomp of an executive signing order to change how his own administration handles this program? Again I can't see why. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that if at one cabinet meeting 2 years ago Trump said ""Betsy, I don't want our disabled vets to have to fill out paperwork. There have been a lot of ideas floated around. Make it easy for them"" it would have set the wheels in motion to make this a non-issue today.

So why did the choose to solve something with an executive order that could have been handled with an internal memo, and choose to push back against it for 2 years until election season started heating up? I don't think there's any way to get an answer on that that isn't loaded with speculation, but I'm pretty jaded an cynical at this point.",osm0sis,,ctoktg,exn1764
,"Reading through the comments here, it seems that the EO simply ""sped up"" the process by which Veterans who were unable to fill out paper work to expedite the with funds *already allocated* for a program passed for Veterans by Congress. This is discussed at length in a comment in this thread by u/osm0sis.

As for your edit related to the PSLF program, I think you're onto something. According to [Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lawsuit-alleges-gross-mismanagement-of-student-loan-forgiveness-by-the-education-department-2019-07-11), the Department of Education *""has allowed loan forgiveness for a mere 518 borrowers applications out of the 73,554 applications it has received as of late March.""* That is, **0.07%** of all applicants to Student Loan Forgiveness received it. Unlike the Veteran's program, however, we're talking about individuals who have already filled out loan forgiveness applications and were previously denied. According to the same article I referenced, there is ""gross mismanagement"" of the PSLF. In light of this fact, I feel that an appropriate course of action to the student loan problem as in the edited post would be an Executive Order to ""re-assess all applications for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program as processed between 2017-2020 to properly determine whether previously denied applicants were unjustly refused student loan forgiveness.""

A proper re-assessment would be able to determine whether applicants had made their required 120 consecutive payments as per [mandated by law](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#receiving-forgiveness). This follows the same logic that Congress has at least approved for funds to be used by the DoE under the power of the purse for the Veteran's Forgiveness (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). As a side note, u/oren0 made an excellent point:

>Forgiving everyone loans, like some candidates want to do, would be a $1.4T hole in the balance sheet that has to come from somewhere.

Now, there's a tricky problem with the Act as passed in 2007 and the the ability to *enact* on this legislation. In 2007, most student loans were *held* by the Private Lenders and *guaranteed* by the US Gov. ~~Now, the~~ *~~Federal Reserve~~* ~~(as of 2016)~~ [~~owns over $1 trillion in student loans~~](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/081216/who-actually-owns-student-loan-debt.asp). ~~The problem I see here is ""how can the government forgive loans that it no longer owns or guarantees, and legally cannot forgive because the DoE no longer guarantees those loans which were taken prior to 2011?"" In my perspective, it would require the Federal Reserve to use a process of QE to print money to purchase the loans in order to forgive them in an ""equitable manner"" that addresses the balance sheet. Either way, this requires seemingly unprecedented co-operation between the Executive Branch and the Federal Reserve - which, if you haven't noticed, has not exactly been friendly lately. The Fed doesn't like being as a political tool. Looking back on this, the fact that the Fed owns so many student loans may actually be evidence as to why so few of these loans have been forgiven.~~

,"Different voting methods are often cited, in particular ranked-choice voting - https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV) - seems like an obvious improvement to the current voting system, as it gives some strategic significance to not alienating all voters without sacrificing the spirit of first-past-the-post - but it still allows for a lot of partisanship. Other systems like ""approval voting"" may reduce partisanship but *clearly* speak to the most populist candidates.",ValueBasedPugs,,csncjs,exg1wgc
,"I believe another important question that could come out of this is: does our current system of governing allow for a decrease in partisanship and polarization? It is no secret that the United States has been divided since its inception (think: [Hamilton](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-true-story-of-alexander-hamilton-2016-1) - just like the musical!). 

I believe another strong perspective comes from [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psych-unseen/201809/why-has-america-become-so-divided), which states that it may not be as bad as we think:

>First, we need to examine whether the country is divided or merely seems that way. Several articles have been written over the past few years reminding us that, despite the name, the US been divided for much of its existence (see Jonathan Rauch’s article at Brookings and Scotty Hendricks’ at Big Think). Indeed, it would be hard to argue that the country is more divided now than it was during the Civil War.

So, while the partisanship may not be as troubling as we believe it to be, this same article states ""there is good evidence that American political parties have become increasingly polarized over the past several decades"" and this can be backed up by the [Pew Research information](https://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/).

All of that said, I would like to focus on the idea of reducing polarization. There was a study done in 2017 that looked at how polarization could be reduced from United States citizens. The study, [""Americans, Not Partisans: Can Priming American National Identity Reduce Affective Polarization?""](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/693987), focuses heavily on American identity and the gridlock faced when dealing with polarization. The study came to a unique solution using the [Common Ingroup Identity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ingroup_identity) and states in the abstract:

>...when subjects’ sense of American national identity is heightened, they come to see members of the opposing party as fellow Americans rather than rival partisans. As a result, they like the opposing party more, thereby reducing affective polarization.

In other words, in order to reduce polarization we need leaders and companies to focus more on the identity of America rather than the identity of a party.

However, I recognize that so far, I have not answered your question! Because of that, I would love to introduce the idea of [non-partisan elections](https://journalstar.com/legislature/nebraska-s-legislature-is-the-nonpartisan-outlier-in-an-increasingly/article_def63c54-e126-5323-bff8-a349c09628c7.html), which has proven to be successful in Nebraska and California.

Knowing this leads one to believe, the problem is not necessarily with the system, but that the [two major parties hold more power than they were ever intended to hold](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/whats-the-answer-to-political-polarization/470163/).

Another option, [given that only around 55% of US citizens vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections), make voting compulsory. From The Atlantic article above:

>In Australia, eligible citizens are required to vote and can face a fine or a court date if they don’t. Not surprisingly, the turnout rate there is more than 95 percent. In a 2010 policy paper, William Galston of the Brookings Institution recommended that states experiment with compulsory voting as a way to reduce polarization and force candidates to appeal to a broader electorate.

However, [Congress has passed dramatically fewer bills than it used to in the seventies](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/statistics), and that's probably not because there are fewer things to address.

Much of it has been, in fact, delegated to agencies, which, overall, do a decent job at it (with some noteworthy exceptions), at least in the sense that most things still work *despite* Congress being what it is. Which is why there's a real panic when Congress fails to pass a funding bill, shutting down agencies.

,"Aside from ranked or approval voting, here a few structural reforms that I think would aleviate polarization.

1) Open all primaries.  Closed primaries only support the echo chamber of the party base.
2) All presidential primaries/caucases occur simultaneously.  This would avoid the current situation where the candidates focus so much campaigning in the early primary (IA, NH, SC) and larger states and practically ignore later states because by the first couple rounds of primaries, candidates start dropping out and voters increasingly vote for the front runner.  All primary voters should have a voice uninfluenced by what's happened in other states before you even get a chance at the ballot box.
3) Decrease the threshold for participating in debates and receiving Federal election assistance.  The more voices that are present, the better.

The problem is, neither party would likely support any of these reforms because they would weaken their own power and give more to this parties and centrists, so it would likely require citizen petition efforts to get these into the various state constitutions.

I do think there's something we (moderate/centrist/third party/unaffiliated) voters can do, though: vote as a block in support of more moderate candidates, regardless of our own personal party affiliations or political leanings.  Right now, there is little-to-no political incentive to move towards the center and nothing but risk.  Just look at Justin Amash in MI or any of the Dems that were primaries by Justice Democrat-backed candidates.

Currently the GOP benefits the most from heavily gerrymandered districts in red states. I’m sure there are democratic examples - but I’ve not found a good nationwide comparison of the effects. 

However, being a progressive in a deep red state I can see how this exacerbates 2 issues in particular:

1. Representatives don’t have to fight for moderate votes because there are none. If anything - incumbents get attacked from the outside not the centre. Thus - everybody goes extreme to not be primaried.

2. Citizens in districts like this effectively have no representation which encourages extremism in those citizens. 

[AP: GOP won more seats in 2018 than suggested by vote share](https://www.apnews.com/9fd72a4c1c5742aead977ee27815d776)

> The AP’s analysis indicates that Republicans won about 16 more U.S. House seats than would have been expected based on their average share of the vote in congressional districts across the country. In state House elections, Republicans’ structural advantage might have helped them hold on to as many as seven chambers that otherwise could have flipped to Democrats, according to the analysis.

And I know Rachel Maddox isn’t exactly a moderate - but the evidence speaks for itself:

[Rachel Maddow reveals how Republicans warped the electoral map in their favor](https://www.salon.com/2018/11/21/rachel-maddow-reveals-how-republicans-warped-the-electoral-map-in-their-favor_partner/)

> ""Way more people went to the polls on Election Day in Wisconsin and voted for a Democrat for their state legislature than voted for a Republican,"" she explained. ""Democrats got a majority of those votes — clearly — 53 percent of the votes cast for state legislatures in Wisconsin were cast for Democrats. Republicans down with 45. Democrats beat them by an 8-point gap in terms of the state legislature. And now look at the results in terms of seats won in the legislature. Even though Democrats got a big majority of the votes, even though the Republicans did not get half the votes that were cast for the legislature, Republicans got 64 percent of the seats! Why is that? Because they tilted the playing field.""

> Even if Republicans lose the national popular vote by as much as 6 percentage points, we estimate that they still have an even-odds chance of retaining control of the House of Representatives. A good half of that advantage comes from creative districting in a handful of states. As a result, several dozen House seats in those states are nearly guaranteed to be occupied by Republicans in nearly any political climate. This advantage is like a levee, built to withstand waves of public opinion that favor the other side.

Instant-Runoff, for single seat elections, still brings us to a two party system (while making third parties even weaker, by transferring votes away from them and up towards major parties). It's something to support, not if you're a third party supporter, but if you're a Democrat who wants the Green Party to stop taking away Democrat votes.

If 60% of Green Party voters list the Dem candidate as their second preference then, if the GP candidate gets eliminated, 60% of that candidate's votes get transferred over to the Dem candidate. In our current system (i.e. plurality), 0% of those votes get transferred. But in either scenario, you end up with a two party single seat electoral system.

While STV can help promote a multiparty system, it can also help promote the opposite system: nonpartisan elections. Instead of proportions being based on party support, they can be based on other things such as race or gender.

confused me a bit.  Are you asking about the *liklihood* of a recession happening before the election?  Or are you asking for arguments for/against intentionally *causing* a recession in order to inspire a presidential change? 

I'll answer both. 

First, I don't think a recession is likely within the next year. The economy has been on a record level of growth, so a softening of the market is to be expected.  It will have to start slowing down.  But because inflation has been [relaxed](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/ray-dalio-manager-of-the-worlds-biggest-hedge-fund-lowers-his-odds-of-a-recession.html), it should help us avoid, or at least postpone, a recession for another couple of years. 


As for the latter theory, about intentionally sabotaging the economy in order to effect change.  I don't think that is ever a good idea. Especially in this particular election. 


The big campaign focus from Trump's opponents revolves around expanding government programs and record spending on social programs.  This spending is proposed to be funded by increased taxes on [business owners and middle class workers alike. ](https://www-forbes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2019/02/19/the-green-new-deal-and-the-cost-of-virtue/amp/?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQEKAFwAQ%3D%3D#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fmiltonezrati%2F2019%2F02%2F19%2Fthe-green-new-deal-and-the-cost-of-virtue%2F) 

Those types of programs are easier for voters to swallow when there is plenty of money to go around and people are making a lot of money.  It's harder for them to support these ambitious types of programs when everyone is tightening their belts.

Here's a think piece regarding what you're asking. I'd still consider it more of a kicking off point, as it's a fairly small data set. Though in a country with only 45 total outcomes, it's hard to have a comfortably sized data set.   


The problem I see with this being heralded as a sure indicator of chances of re-election, is that it's more complicated than one metric can predict.

> The law toughened again in 1990 extending the 5 year threshold to 7 years. In 1998, student loan debt became non-dischargeable in bankruptcy except in cases of undue hardship.

> Under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), the student loan exception to discharge expanded to cover almost any debt incurred as an education expense.

,"I'm going to assume that by ""assault weapon"" you mean a semi-automatic rifle that accepts magazines. If the case you site were to be used as precedent, it would probably come down to what constitutes ""common"".  [The National Shooting Sports Foundation estimates there are roughly 5  million to 10 million AR-15 rifles owned in the United States](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/13/owned-by-5-million-americans-ar-15-under-renewed-fire-after-orlando-massacre.html). That number alone strikes me as fulfilling the criteria of common, and the AR-15 is not the only weapon of that type out there. But I can definitely see arguments being made that the number would have to higher, since ""common"" is so open to interpretation.",,,cr5yg0,ex3d7io
,"u/Chasicle and others have asked ""What is an assault weapon?""

You have to start here.  Assault weapon is a legal term of art.  Take the recently proposed [H.R.1296 - Assault Weapons Ban of 2019's](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1296/text) suggested [amendments to the definitions](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr1296/BILLS-116hr1296ih.pdf) of [18 U.S.C. §921](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921):

>(36) The term ‘semiautomatic assault weapon’ means any of the following, regardless of country of manufacture or caliber of ammunition accepted:

>...

>(D) A semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and any one of the following: (i) A threaded barrel. (ii) A second pistol grip. (iii) A barrel shroud. (iv) The capacity to accept a detachable magazine at some location outside of the pistol grip. (v) A semiautomatic version of an auto-
matic firearm. (vi) A manufactured weight of 50 ounces
or more when unloaded. (vii) A stabilizing brace or similar compo-
nent.

>(E) A semiautomatic pistol with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds.

>(F) A semiautomatic shotgun that has any one of the following: (i) A folding, telescoping, or detachable stock. (ii) A pistol grip. (iii) A fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 5 rounds. (iv) The ability to accept a detachable magazine. (v) A forward grip. (vi) A grenade launcher. (G) Any shotgun with a revolving cylinder.

>...

So, a semi-automatic pistol with a threaded barrel for a sound suppressor to help prevent hearing loss would be considered an ""assault weapon"" under this definition as well as certain shotguns.  The term is often confused with select-fire rifles (i.e. those capable of choosing between semi-automatic, burst, and/or automatic fire) with an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine (i.e. [assault rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle).) which are already more or less banned.  So, assault weapon is a legal term of art and not otherwise a class of firearm.  In other words, anything can be an ""assault weapon"" depending on how the law is written.

Turning to buy backs, let's take a look at an example from state law. California has a different definition of assault weapon, using several methods to define them from a list by [make and model](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=30510.) to [a definition based on features](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=30515.). [California Penal Code, § 30605](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=30605.) allows for a firearm defined as an assault weapon that is relinquished to be destroyed.  [Cal. Penal Code, § 18005](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=18005.) allows for weapons to be sold at public auction or destroyed.  The argument supporting this is likely some combination of a state's traditional police powers and that you do not have a property interest in goods which are illegal to possess.

>Would such a law/policy be legal?

Could such a law be passed?  Sure.  Would it be Constitutional?  In a way, Blackstone answers that question when discussing how the the right to bear arms functions in a free state in [his first chapter, ""Of the Absolute Rights of Individuals,"" in his Commentaries on the Laws of England:](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp)

>But in vain would these rights be declared, ascertained, and protected by the dead letter of the laws, if the constitution had provided no other method to secure their actual enjoyment. It has therefore established certain other auxiliary subordinate rights of the subject, which serve principally as barriers to protect and maintain inviolate the three great and primary rights, of personal security, personal liberty, and private property.

****

>...we have seen that these rights consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights, having no other object upon which it can possibly be employed. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it's full vigor; and limits certainly known, be set to the royal prerogative. And, lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly to the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence. And all these rights and liberties it is our birthright to enjoy entire; unless where the laws of our country have laid them under necessary restraints. Restraints in themselves so gentle and moderate, will appear upon farther enquiry, that no man of sense or probity would wish to see them slackened.

Civil rights, such as the second amendment, are intended as a constraint on government power.  When the government engages in the business of loosening constraints upon itself, people have recourse in the courts and, failing that, reaching out to their elected representatives and officials.  

[Some courts](http://michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-07-22-Order-Granting-Defendants-MSJ-Denying-Plaintiffs-MSJ.pdf) do take the second amendment to read much more narrowly and see banning certain weapons as ""gentle and moderate"" in light of that court's view that ""Semiautomatic rifles with non-fixed magazines, along with the other enumerated features, are incredibly effective killing machines...""  This line of reasoning attempts to blur the lines between assault weapons and assault rifles in order to fit the former within a comment from [D.C. v. Heller](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6484080926445491577&q=District+of+Columbia+v.+Heller&hl=en&as_sdt=2006), ""It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service—M-16 rifles and the like—may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause.""  So, does ""M-16 rifles and the like"" mean the M-16 and other assault rifles, firearms capable of burst and/or automatic fire? Or, do certain semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns also resemble M-16s?

,"The biggest problem you're going to have with anything regarding ""assault weapons"" is that there's no agreed upon definition of what an [""assault weapon""](https://reason.com/2018/05/14/assault-weapons-explained/) is. In many cases, the determination is arbitrary or aesthetic rather than an objective classification that can be clearly applied to all firearms. The article uses the Ruger Mini 14 as an example. It's a firearm that comes in many variants, some of which might be considered ""assault weapons"", but there's mechanically little to no difference in the actual operation or functionality of them.

All of that aside, compelled sale of legally owned property is a tough subject. The closest thing the US has to that is [Eminent Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain_in_the_United_States), but even that has requirements that don't strictly apply to this situation, like public need/use. The other big hurdle, which a lot of gun owners would site as a financial reason for not participating in buyback programs is [""just compensation""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_compensation) (which most people don't realize is a constitutional requirement when the government seizes private property).",tklite,,cr5yg0,ex3c04q
,"The short answer is maybe. I'm by no means an expert in weapons law, but I do like the constitution a lot, so I'll come at it from that angle. 

Even since Heller, people's right to bear arms was divorced from the organized militia part of the [Second Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-ii), but that right does not appear to be unlimited. Even though [Federal legislation banning assault weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States) has never passed (and therefore was never tested in the courts), state law regulations of those weapons seems to have survived challenge. It therefore appears that the government MIGHT have the right to regulate those weapons.

The other applicable constitutional concept is [Eminent domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain), which obliges a government that takes a thing to pay for it. Therefore, the govenment can buy your stuff without your consent. 

There might be an undue restraint of commerce or right to contract argument, but I don't think it will really have any impact.

,"As a preface to my argument, I would ask that we restrict opinions to the subject at hand - firearms legislation. 
With that what being said, I think there is is oddly a lot of useful precedent to be found in the battle over abortion and restriction of its practice.

[Roe v Wade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) famously mad abortion legal on the basis that the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental ""right to privacy"". This right is not absolute, and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and protecting prenatal life. Even with the most critical reading, I think it is fair to say that gun ownership has *at minimum* as much Constitutional support as abortion being legal. The lesson here, which can be seen in a multitude of other rulings on various topics, is that no Constitutional right is absolute and they must be balanced against the impact on others rights.

The [Hyde Amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment) specifically restricted the use of federal funds to provide for abortion. To me, this implies that a law could be passed restricting the use of federal funds for gun buy-back. The absence of such an law does not however prove that a federally funded buy-back would be legal.

[Planned Parenthood v Casey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey) established the ""undue burden"" standard for abortion resteictions which applies to any restriction with ""the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion"". It is also worth noting that this ruling determined that a 24 hour waiting period for abortion did not qualify as an undue burden, which should be self evident in its relevance to firearm laws. When people talking about banning assault weapons are citing barrel shrouds, which have absolutely no effect on the lethality of any firearm, I think that is an identical example of a restriction that places an undue burden on a person exercising their Constitutional right.

[Stenburg v Carhart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenberg_v._Carhart) was a case where the supreme court overturned a Nebraska law banning ""partial birth abortion"" on the grounds that it was overly broad and was akin to a total ban. When there are definitions of ""assault weapons"" that include pistols, shotguns, and rifles with a wide array of common features, I would argue that too qualifies as overly broad.

The [Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act), unlike the Nebraska law, was found to be Constitutional as it was not overly broad. The lesson here is that a ""assault weapon"" definition would have to meet a certain reasonable threshold of restrictiveness.

[Whole Woman Health v Hellerstadt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Woman%27s_Health_v._Hellerstedt) ruled again that certain restrictions created an undue burden on abortion access, specifically admitting privileges for abortion doctors and surgical center requirements for those doctor's offices. Broadly, I could see similar arguments being made that restrictions on the licensing and operation of firearm vendors could similarly be an undue burden if they become too restrictive. 

I dont have any grand conclusions whether or not a buyback would be possible or legal. I am just trying to establish some vaguely consistent legal boundaries of what is and is not possible. Even the most fervently anti-gun person has to admit that firearm ownership has a more firm Constitutional grounding than abortion, so it is reasonable to at bare minimum be no more restrictive than laws regarding that.",heimdahl81,,cr5yg0,ex4vyo0

>It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency 'In God We Trust' has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise. ...It is not easy to discern any religious significance attendant the payment of a bill with coin or currency on which has been imprinted 'In God We Trust' or the study of a government publication or document bearing that slogan. In fact, such secular uses of the motto was viewed as sacrilegious and irreverent by President Theodore Roosevelt. Yet Congress has directed such uses. While 'ceremonial' and 'patriotic' may not be particularly apt words to describe the category of the national motto, it is excluded from First Amendment significance because the motto has no theological or ritualistic impact. As stated by the Congressional report, it has 'spiritual and psychological value' and 'inspirational quality.'

So, how I read that at least, while the phrase ""In God We Trust"" has the word God in it there's no deep religious meaning or use to it and it's really just a saying at this point.

Red flag laws ignore the due process of law by their very nature. With nothing more than a phone call from , you are deprived of your property and your 2nd amendment constitutional rights, which could be argued by some to be an aspect of your liberty.

Due process means that you are allowed to face your accuser in court and plead your case to defend yourself. ERPO hearings are usually held without the accused even being notified, much less allowed to present a defense or cross-examine the person accusing you.

Furthermore, it does not need to be proven you have committed a crime to deprive you of your property. The only requirement is that someone else believes you might commit a crime - harming yourself or others. This opens the door to other similar laws, where you could have your computer confiscated if someone believes you might start cyber bullying or spreading false news for example. It's impossible for the punishment to ***NOT*** be cruel and unusual when no crime has been committed in the first place.

Ignoring the gun debate entirely, red flag laws still set a dangerous precedent that people can be ""convicted"" and punished while never being arrested, never knowing the charges against them until it's already decided, and never setting foot in a court of law to defend themselves.

,"There are really only two cases that I can find where the red flag law was challenged and upheld.   One was in Indiana in [Redington v State](https://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/08061302ebb.pdf), but if you read that, the guy was kind of bonkers.   He's been hallucinating based on other sources as well, and the police were the first ones to make contact with him and attest to his odd behavior.

It's some heavy reading if you want to read it, but from what I surmised, it boiled down to the fact that the court found that Indiana had the ""police power to protect the public welfare"" even though Redington was never charged or convicted for a crime.  

&#x200B;

In Connecticut, [Hope v State](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ct-court-of-appeals/1724697.html) challenged a similar law.   However, this did not challenge the due process, but rather that the state law violated his 2nd Amendment.  The court defended that by saying the state can regulate firearms -- and that Hope had shown mental illness and therefore the state can regulate, or restrict, his access to firearms for one year.   They also stated that because it was a limited time, it was not a full infringement of his rights.

&#x200B;

In my mind, both of these cases required some serious mental gymnastics.   The first case is the only one that really challenged property being taken without due process, so the current docket on these cases is very slim and have only been argued in the respective states' appellate courts.  While Indiana is fairly conservative, the current SCOTUS is almost certainly conservative.

I think, had a red flag law objection with a good argument be brought up to the SCOTUS, then we might see much more different results.  That hasn't happened ... yet.

Personally, I disagree with red flag laws due to someone being deprived of their property without proper due process and that due process normally (or ever) involve a crime having been committed.  The burden, as it stands, is very low, and I think that these laws can be abused by government and the herd mentality of the public at large.

A family member, household member, or law enforcement officer may petition your county Circuit Court for an Order by[ filling out a notarized petition](https://imgur.com/a/WFj5ALu) with facts showing that the person is a danger to themselves or to others. The court will then hold a hearing typically within 24-hours. If the judge agrees, all weapons and concealed handgun permits must be surrendered within 24-hours of issuing the Order.

**Who can request:**

* A law enforcement officer

* Family member

*  Spouse

*  Intimate partner

*  Parent

*  Child

*  Sibling

* Any person living in the household of the person they are concerned about can request an Order from the court.

**Timeline:**

The court must hold a hearing typically the same day or within 24-hours. The person who requests the petition must appear in person or by video at the hearing. If the person who is at risk requests a hearing, then the court must hold an additional hearing within 21 days. If approved, the Order is usually effective for one year.",belortik,,cqliem,ewyvt6c

Red flag laws are a violation of the Second Amendment, *however*, I believe that there is a ""compelling governmental interest"" for the state to prevent mass murder (I can expand on why this is if necessary). Beyond this state interest, I would also argue that red flag laws should be *narrowly tailored* so as to not infringe on the rights of everyday gun owners (no anonymous tips, etc). Further, they must be backed by significant due process. While a court may be able to issue a temporary injunction to remove firearms from the hands of dangerous people, the accused has the right to a speedy trial (usually within 2 weeks?) during which the government must prove that the person is likely *beyond a reasonable doubt* to use those firearms for mass murder or violence against others.

>**V. Legal Challenges to Gun Violence Restraining Order Laws**  
>  
>Litigation challenging firearms laws has become a routine strategy of gun manufacturers, the National Rifle Association, and others. These challenges most often raise the following issues: (1) the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and (2) the Due Process Clause. The following brief discussion illustrates why a GVRO, as described in this resolution, comports with these constitutional provisions.  
>  
>A. Second Amendment  
>  
>The GVRO process is consistent with the Second Amendment. In the landmark case, *District of Columbia v. Heller*, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court determined that the Second Amendment guarantees the right of “law-abiding, responsible citizens” to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense. However, the Supreme Court also stated that the Second Amendment is “not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” The Court explicitly recognized “the problem of handgun violence in this country,” and confirmed that the “Constitution leaves ... a variety of tools for combating that problem.” Among those tools, the Court identified several examples of presumptively valid gun regulations, including those that prohibit firearm possession by felons and the mentally ill.  
>  
>Since the 2008 decision in *Heller*, courts across the country have been faced with challenges to many kinds of gun regulations. Courts have almost uniformly upheld strong gun laws, and the Supreme Court has also repeatedly declined to hear any new cases raising Second Amendment claims, denying certiorari in 70 Second Amendment cases since *Heller* and *McDonald v. Chicago*, 561 U.S. 742, 778 (2010). The courts have consistently upheld laws aimed at reducing access to guns by those who are deemed likely to misuse them 11 . Courts have also broadly upheld restrictions on firearm access by persons who have been detained or hospitalized for mental health treatment and evaluation 12 , and they have affirmed law enforcement’s authority to provisionally remove firearms from individuals found to pose an imminent risk of danger to themselves or others as a result of mental illness 13 . **In 2013, an Indiana Appellate Court rejected a Second Amendment challenge to that state’s gun violence restraining order law, ruling that the state may restrict access to firearms by dangerous individuals in the interest of public safety and welfare 14 . The Court noted that “the United States Supreme Court has recently and repeatedly recognized the legitimate governmental purpose of prohibiting violent mentally ill persons from possessing firearms.” Because the state’s GVRO law provided ample due process protections, the Court found that it did “not place a material burden upon the core value of the individual’s right” under the Second Amendment. A similar law has been successfully implemented in Connecticut since 1999, and withstood a constitutional challenge in 2016. 15**  
>  
>B. Due Process  
>  
>Procedures for obtaining a GVRO can also be instituted so as to satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause. These procedures are generally based on existing domestic violence laws that courts have repeatedly upheld against due process challenges. (The legal basis for these challenges lies in the court’s authority to issue an *ex parte* order before a full hearing occurs, which is neither explicitly required nor precluded by this resolution.)  
>  
>**In** ***Blazel v. Bradley***\*\*, 698 F. Supp. 756, 768 (W.D. Wis. 1988), a federal district court held that a Wisconsin law allowing victims of domestic abuse to seek\*\* ***ex parte*** **restraining orders against their abusers was constitutional and satisfied due process requirements. The court emphasized that the procedure under Wisconsin law requires:**  
>  
>**1. Judicial participation;** **2. A verified petition containing detailed allegations before the** ***ex parte*** **order is issued;** **3. A prompt hearing; and** **4. An allegation of risk of imminent and irreparable harm based on personal knowledge of the respondent.**   
>  
>Courts across the country have come to similar conclusions. They have rejected due process challenges to *ex parte* domestic violence orders issued after these or similar requirements have been met. 16  
>  
>The resolution accompanying this report explicitly requires that a GVRO be consistent with the strictures of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. In particular, the provisions outlined in subsections 1 through 3 of the resolution set specific standards that comport with due process.

Yes, his family wanted him not to have guns in the house they live in.   When police came, he answered door with a gun in his hand.  He DID put the gun down when he saw it was law enforcement.  When they told him why they were there he grabbed the gun and pointed it at them.

Another consideration is how countries like Brazil, being closer to the equator, have an abundance of Sun, allowing a higher energy return from producing fuel from sugar cane, but corn as a source is considerably lower yield per acre.

While biofuel production helps reduce the demand of fuel from there ""Big Oil"" companies, it must be met with a reduction overall of hydrocarbon fuels, and I'm afraid that it is often seen as a way to rationalize higher consumption, thereby negating any benefit, if there were one to begin with.

,"This is a really interesting question. I'm not a policy expert, but as a chemical engineer with a background in biofuel synthesis, I can provide some perspective on the politics of the ethanol subsidy.

I'll start by saying corn-to-ethanol fuel production has really slim margins. We have seen an uptick in corn biofuel production in recent years, but this is largely due to [better-than-average corn harvests](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32152) and likely not indicative of the long-term profitability of corn-to-ethanol fermentation plants. If it weren't for ethanol fuel subsidies and the mixture mandate, the entire corn-to-ethanol biofuel industry would be completely unprofitable. So why do we, the American taxpayers, pay to keep this struggling and volatile industry afloat?

We were sold on the idea that ethanol is a ""greener"" fuel than gasoline. This is debatable. For starters, one gallon of ethanol contains about 64% of the energy as one gallon of gasoline. While it is true that burning one gallon of ethanol releases roughly 1/3 of the CO2 as one gallon of gasoline, the CO2 released while transporting the extra ethanol needed to achieve the gasoline equivalent blurs the line between ""green fuel"" and ""what the hell are we burning this stuff for.""

We were also sold on the idea that producing biofuels will make us more energy independent and reduce our reliance on the Middle East for energy. This may be true, but as the United States is predicted to become a [net exporter of energy](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38152) by 2020, the argument becomes less convincing. American oil, coal, and natural gas are powering the majority of our homes and factories. As solar and wind power generation technologies continue to improve and gain footholds in the US energy market, what is the role of corn biofuels, which really aren't that green, nor economical, nor sustainable?

Honestly, there is no practical role for biofuels moving forward. We are developing technologies that can provide us with energy without having to combust anything. We are developing a stronger and more flexible power grid. We really should be moving away from fuels that generate CO2, but we continue to see the ethanol subsidy renewed. We continue to mandate diluting our gasoline with crappier fuel. Why? Probably because the ethanol subsidy and mixture mandate generates votes in critical areas.

As mentioned in other posts, corn is the primary feedstock used to produce ethanol fuel in the United States, and subsidizing ethanol production increases the overall demand for corn. The four largest corn-producing states in the US are Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota. Coincidentally, two of these four (Iowa and Minnesota) are perennial swing states, and one is quickly becoming a battleground state (Nebraska). By increasing the demand for corn, politicians make the farmers happy. In turn, the farmers vote for who makes them happy.

In my opinion, the pros of ethanol subsidies and the fuel mixture mandate are that they generate and collect votes. The con is biofuels will have a really limited role in the US energy market of the future and should not be a target of federal policies. I'll let you decide if the pros outweigh the cons.",TexasK2,,codx27,ewm6v0h
,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned the the increased detonation resistance ethanol blends provide. Ethanol is pretty harmless and has an octane rating of around 109 so it works as an octane booster in gasoline taking the place of harmful additives used in the past such as lead or MTBE. Higher octane fuels allow manufacturers to design engines with higher compression ratios and more ignition timing. As a result the combustion process becomes more clean, efficient, and powerful with less NOx emissions.

,">If so, what recourse do those in support of Hong Kong's semi-autonomous state have? And what influence do countries like the UK, which handed back Hong Kong with the understanding that it would remain somewhat autonomous, have over the situation?

First, it seems foolish not to emphasize that  an unnervingly probable recourse would be armed conflict, possibly a full scale urban war in the streets of Hong Kong.  The PRC government is [quite famously willing to use violent force en masse against protesters.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests)  At that point, the only successful means of recourse is shooting back.

Given China's military prowess and [nuclear capability,](https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/china/nuclear/) it seems unlikely any foreign power could reasonably invade mainland China to intervene.  

As to diplomatic options, the PRC engages in [enormous amounts of international trade](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/CHN) and could be subject to sanctions, though at severe economic cost to the countries imposing sanctions, especially as [many companies' supply chains rely on Chinese goods.](https://www.ft.com/content/6dd3e4cc-83d5-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849)

As to some more creative solutions, I could see a western country offering residency visas to any Hongkonger who wants them.  This would likely harm the protests success by giving them a brain drain problem, but also would allow a lot of people who might be caught up in PRC raids/internment/killing an escape valve, and also could provide a boon of skilled and ambitious immigrants to the country offering the visas.",huadpe,,cnomcg,ewco259
,">is that technically a breach of the ""one country, two systems"" principle?

From Hong Kong

I would like to point out that the one country, two systems principle have already been breached many, many times.  The most significant is the kidnapping of of the [Causeway bay book seller Lee Bo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances) where a bookseller performing perfectly legal activities were kidnapped and sent into China and prosecuted and forced to make confessional videos for breaking mainland laws (while not in mainland at all) 

And the biggest, most controversial high-speed rail's Juxtaposed controls at the West Kowloon Station where Chinese officials are allowed to enter and enforce mainland laws in Hong Kong borders.

Also the longest ongoing policy where China seized approval rights for immigration from China to Hong Kong, causing 150 new families to enter and flood the already overcrowded city **daily**.

Should One Country, Two Systems still is upheld, none of these should have happened.

Now, onto the main point.  It seems like, in my biased view, currently, Hong Kong's appointed Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, is purposely failing to quell the protests, and causing the violence to escalate.  Why?  Because it didn't have to.  Here's a quick run down of what happened:

In February 2019, the government proposed an extradition bill to be passed by the pro-Chinese “majority”([more details on this here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/cnomcg/comment/ewe2r1p) After what happened to the booksellers, community expressed fears about the legislation that the city would open itself up to the long arm of mainland Chinese law and that people from Hong Kong fall victim to a different legal system

This of course raised very large scale of unpopularity and opposition int he city. On 31st of March and and 28 April, an upwards of 510,000 people marched on the street against the bill.

Keep in mind that Hong Kong is a small city of 7mil population. 510k people already meant 6.9% of the population. The 2018 woman’s march in New York City, one of the largest protests in the US in recent times, only reached 200k out of 8.62mil people, or about 2.3%. So this is a huge deal. 

Unfortunately, the protests were met with [government’s repose that the bill will be adamantly enacted and the new extradition law has to be passed before summer break.](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1455134-20190429.htm)

Obviously when a large protest’s demand is met with opposite response, people are going to get more upset. Morales are not going to improve no matter how much you continue with the beatings. They also gained more support from various groups.

On the 6th of June, [lawyers marched on the street in silent. They dressed in black and were numbered in the 3,000s](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3013461/thousands-hong-kong-lawyers-launch-silent-march-against) (note this is a lawyers only march, so 3000 lawyers already represent a whopping 25% of the city’s total lawyer population!)

This again was met with the government’s (yet again) inadequate response saying that the lawyers don’t understand the law(wut!?) [2](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-politics-extradition-march-idUKKCN1T71IN)

Well guess what’s going to happen when the government ignores their people, call them stupid, and act in the opposite direction of their subjects? People push back. On 9th June a MASSIVE protest, with crowd size as much as 1.02million, erupted. The government’s response? [Double the fuck down and say they will pass the bill on the 12. I’m not kidding](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201906/09/P2019060900587.htm?fontSize=1)

You would think it’s stupid but yeah that’s actually what happened. It was only until the 12th where part of the protesters turned radical and used violence approach that the government finally stopped doubling down on their efforts to pass the possibly the second most unpopular bill in Hong Kong (after article 23), saying that it is postponed.

You hear it right. Postponed. Not withdrawn. Just postponed. You know, postponed as in, it’s still going to get passed, haha suckers! Go home! Nothing to see now!

But Hong Kong is probably one of the more, if not most educated cities in China, and the people there are by no means suckers. The hurricane has hit the fertiliser pile. Protests popped up everywhere, clashes happened everywhere, and many protesters were labelled “rioters” (but not the people chasing and beating people up in [Yuen Long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16CiwPChpr0). Noooo they’re on the government’s side so they can’t be rioters).  Polices were accused of cooperating with triads, and dissent continues to grow *even further*

The political room people stinked up quite a bit and the government finally took another 1/5th of a step back and said the bill is “suspended”. The pro-democracy camp feared it was merely a tactical retreat and demanded a full withdrawal of the bill and said they would go ahead with the 16 June rally as planned. 

The demands from the protest groups also widened as the government took more actions against the protesters during the shitstorm. They also called for the resignation of the governor(equivalent), apology for ""dis-proportionally violent"" police tactics towards peaceful protesters, the release of arrested protesters, and to withdraw the official characterisation of the protest on 12 June as ""riot"".

So the government finally took a good, hard look and evaluated their action and responded to the pro democracy groups to have a talk and negotiated with how their demands can be met, or compromises if it can’t be.

Not.

So the largest protest in Hong Kong’s history happened on 12th of June. The story doesn’t just end there and there were a lot of events happening along the way, including additional unpopular bills (such as the government's prospective surrender of a strip of land in Central Harbourfront to the People's Liberation Army on 29 June), use of tear gas inside a building, and other crap, the government finally announced that the bill is withdrawn but that was 4 months after the first large scale protest.

Well, fast forward to today. The people of Hong Kong have [five major demands](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/07/14/five-demands-must-fulfilled-thousands-hong-kong-anti-extradition-law-protesters-rally-sha-tin/), and probably only one has been (kind of) met, and no planned negotiation/response of the rest in sight right now:

 * Resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the holding of free and fair elections for the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive

 * Complete withdrawal of the Extradition Bill (it's still officially in suspension in the legislative council, the bill hasn't been withdrawn in black and white)

 * Release and exoneration of protesters

 * Accountability for police force

 * Retract the characterisation of the 12 June protest as a riot

Given the slow and seemingly ""middle finger in the face"" response from previously, what it feels like is that the administration is purposely dragging their feet in responding, while advising the police to push harder on the protesters to incite further violences.  Without citing any news article but my personal experience, on 5th July, my residence was *literally* hit by a tear gas canister near midnight at 11:47pm.

,"With regard to the power of the Monarch to dismiss the Prime Minister, there haven't been any examples since the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 of the dismissal power being used, and indeed, this has not happened since [Lord Melbourne was dismissed in 1834](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_government,_1830%E2%80%931834). Accordingly, it is unclear whether in practice the Monarch could dismiss the Prime Minister - so much so that a [2017 Parliamentary report](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN03861) (on page 10) leaves the issue unaddressed. The same report on page 22, however, notes the following:

> It became established that the bulk of prerogative powers could be exercised only through and on the advice of ministers responsible to Parliament. Although the monarch retained formal power of appointment and removal of ministers and ministries, the development of collective ministerial responsibility made it increasingly difficult for the King or Queen to exercise such power freely against the wishes of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

From this, it could be suggested that the only way for the Monarch to practically exercise such a power would be through the explicit request of Parliament, possibly through the [humble address procedure](https://beta.parliament.uk/articles/MgAh1c5Q) (although I'm unsure if that would be sufficient). However, the power most likely still exists at least on a theoretical level, as there are no statutes explicitly abolishing the Royal Prerogative power to dismiss the Prime Minister.

With regard to the other scenario, regarding a dispute as to an alternative government under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011, it's important to note that [section 2\(3\)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/2) states that:

> (3)An early parliamentary general election is also to take place if—
> 
> * (a)the House of Commons passes a motion in the form set out in subsection (4), and
> 
> * (b)the period of 14 days after the day on which that motion is passed ends **without the House passing a motion in the form set out in subsection (5).**

Accordingly, where there is a dispute as to whether an alternative government can be formed with the confidence of the Commons, a general election is called. The form of motion in subsection (5) in order to gauge Parliamentary support is the following:

> “That this House has confidence in Her Majesty's Government.”

,">Is the NATO 5.56 a high-powered gun? LINK Here is an image of the 5.56 ammunition that was fired at both shootings. (It is the small one on the left.) Some discount the ""gun theory""and think that 100 round magazines and not a particular type of rifle are the issue. LINK So what is the evidence that specific rifles or large-capacity magazines are the real issue?  

I'll take a go at this part, and maybe a few other general suggestions on policy/prevention. [5.56 NATO] is the standard cartridge used in Armarlite Rifle (AR) patterned rifles and many other carbines/rifles in use by multiple nations military and police forces. The round is a smaller diameter and carries less energy than it's [large bore cousins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle_cartridge#Full-powered), but is still effective for targets 200-600 meters. The cartridge itself is based on the [223 Remington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.223_Remington). For reading more on why it was chosen and developed into the current NATO standard [read this long winded but very informative article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1981/06/m-16-a-bureaucratic-horror-story/545153/). Regarding the ""high powered"" nature of the cartridge: firearm cartridges usually have a variety of bullet weights and associated velocities that combine to give a specific kinetic energy. This energy is what many people attribute to a rounds ""lethality"", although shot placement is more key with respect to how effective a round is in stopping a threat.  Hitting an arm will not incapacitate someone, whereas hitting a vital organ or the CNS often leads to immediate loss of bodily functions.  

Why does all this matter? Well surprisingly enough, rifle cartridges (with the correct ammo) actually tend to have less over-penetration in [common household mediums (i.e. drywall)](http://how-i-did-it.org/drywall/results.html). than most of the common pistol or shotgun rounds. Additionally, the AR platform tends to be a more controllable and easier to operate than your typical 12 gauge pump action, particularly those of smaller stature. Additionally, the likelihood of having malfunction via a pump shotgun is increased during high stress scenarios in that one can ""short stroke"" the mechanism and induce a failure. These rifles also offer a significant advantage over traditional rifles in that they can be adjusted to fit the user's anatomy and build. Compared to the pistol, the rifle offers a more stable and reliable platform for easier follow-up shots, [as often one shot is not enough to stop a threat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdjcYjSsIok) before they can harm you.  

What all this means is that the AR pattern rifles used in these tragedies are the Honda Civic of firearms, ubiquitous and endlessly customization to each person. The flip-side of these positive aspects is that nefarious use is also within the grasp of those that might otherwise abuse the tool in question.  

So just ban ARs and assault weapons you say. One size fits all rifles, no adjustment, convoluted controls, 10 rounds, Huzza! In reality, what happens is [you don't solve the problem](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/204431.pdf). Most gun homicides are perpetuated via handguns, which [carries over to mass shootings](https://www.statista.com/statistics/476409/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-weapon-types-used/). In reality, the policies to prevent mass shootings have to take a more targeted approach at root cause. We do know that violence and income inequality [are definitively linked](https://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime%26Inequality.pdf), which might point to why [general violence among urban youth is so high compared to the general populous](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mass-shootings-are-a-bad-way-to-understand-gun-violence/) and why policies like Assault Weapons Bans and the like will have marginal to no net effect on the overall homicide rates. Also, ERPOs and Red Flag laws seem like good solutions,[but arguably can be abused](https://www.salon.com/2019/03/26/red-flag-laws-and-the-consequences-of-good-intentions_partner/).

,"Reposting here since the more recent thread was removed:

One place we can start is improving the effectiveness of existing legislation around firearms. There are laws at both the state and federal level that, due to a variety of reasons, may be considered ineffective. [The National Instant Criminal Background Check System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_System \(NICS\)) is one of the more relevant examples of an ineffective law due to improper implementation. While NICS has served as the current implementation of a universal background check system for over 2 decades, [many claim](https://thinkprogress.org/exclusive-the-fbi-allowed-over-300-000-gun-purchases-last-year-before-completing-a-background-9d380d53aa1d/) that NICS lacks the resources and tools to be effective. In fact, [according to the Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/mobile/products/GAO-18-440), over 112,000 checks were denied in 2017. Of these denials, the ATF investigated fewer than 13,000 of them. Of these investigations, only 12 have resulted in prosecution.

Several firearm laws have also proven ineffective due to lack of compliance by the people. There have been [several firearm (or accessory) registration requirements](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2015/06/24/nearly-one-million-new-yorkers-didnt-register-their-assault-weapons/#4bfc5bf2702f) that demonstrate this. In Connecticut, there may be as many as 300,000 residents who are legally felons for not registering their ""assault weapons"" by a specific deadline. In New York, close to 1,000,000 residents may legally be felons for similarly failing to register their ""assault weapons"" by a specific deadline. The same may be true for the large capacity magazine bans in [Connecticut](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_943.htm#sec_53-202w) and [New Jersey](https://www.njsp.org/firearms/firearms-faqs.shtml).

Similar to the above, some firearms laws are not effective due to lack of proper enforcement, even when sufficient resources are available. Recently, this has manifested through the existence of [Second Amendment sanctuary cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_sanctuary). Specifically, certain communities at both the state and local level have stated that they will not use resources to enforce firearm laws they believe violate the Second Amendment.

One final subcategory of ineffective laws are those that are virtually impossible to enforce. 3D printing as a technology has effectively created a method to bypass many firearms laws through the [printing of essential firearms components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printed_firearms). In a similar manner, the Bureau of Justice Statistics determined that only [10% of firearms](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/suficspi16.pdf) used in the studied cases of criminal activity were purchased at a retail source. The remaining 90% were sourced from other means, including another individual (25.3%) and an underground market (43.2%). Multiple laws can be bypassed through these alternate means of acquiring firearms.

On a personal note, this doesn't mean that I support the above laws. They merely serve as examples of legislation that was destined to fail from the start.",Resvrgam2,,cm30iu,ew71eck

,"IMHO, asking about outright prevention is tricky, and it's better to instead think about what would be effective at preventing similar incidents in the future.

There was also a panel study published earlier this year which looked at the impact of state firearm laws on firearm deaths. Their main findings: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-019-04922-x

> The outcome measures were the annual age-adjusted rates of homicide and suicide in each state during the period 1991–2016. We controlled for a wide range of state-level factors.

> Universal background checks were associated with a 14.9% (95% CI, 5.2–23.6%) reduction in overall homicide rates, violent misdemeanor laws were associated with a 18.1% (95% CI, 8.1–27.1%) reduction in homicide, and “shall issue” laws were associated with a 9.0% (95% CI, 1.1–17.4%) increase in homicide. These laws were significantly associated only with firearm-related homicide rates, not non-firearm-related homicide rates. None of the other laws examined were consistently related to overall homicide or suicide rates.

In the above, I think ""violent misdemeanor laws"" refers to firearm restrictions for those guilty of violent misdemeanors.",neuronexmachina,,cm30iu,ew4dl1r
,"I believe an effective way in which a compromise can be reached between the two major political factions in the US may be to control the amount of ammunition an individual is allowed to own as opposed to controlling guns.

If people would like to buy a gun they can with the same rules as the current system, however with the change that a gun owner may only own three bullets at a time,(it is assumed that the gun is only used for self defense at home, therefore 1 bullet as a warning shot, and two chances to use the gun to stop an intruder.) 

If a gun owner would like to use their gun for recreational purposes they would have to go to a designated shooting range run by an individual with extensive training and background checks. This individual would be allowed to purchase as much ammunition as they would like (within reason, to prevent them from supplying gangs) and will be strictly regulated and checked to ensure the ammunition is being used for its intended purpose.

The reason I believe this could actually work is: 

1. The NRA is happy because people still buy guns, therefore they don’t lobby against it. 

2. Three rounds significantly reduces the damage that can be done by a shooter.

3. Gun owners are happy as they can use their firearm for both recreational and protective means

4. People who argue that guns are required to protect themselves against a tyrannical government are satisfied as they can own guns, and if such a time came, collect ammunition from the individuals who own shooting ranges, who would be licensed to provide ammunition to citizens if they believed it was required to defend against a tyrannical government (however unlikely this outcome is the important thing is that it allows everyone to agree.)

The main thing that this approach has going for it is that it is a good compromise for everyone, of every opinion, as often laws are not changed simply due to the fact that one major political group disagrees with the other.

I would just like to state that all of the above is hypothetical, there aren’t any real life examples of this and the extrapolations of what would happen are also my own opinions. There is no evidence that I know of backing up this idea. As well as this I’m not an American citizen and apologize if their are faults in my argument due to a lack of knowledge about how gun laws are implemented in America.",whatnot737,,cm30iu,ewvwqes

Those people should go to jail under conspiracy laws. I would investigate a duty to report for social media sites - add a report button and review cases for forwarding to law enforcement.

Raise the age to buy a gun to 25 (or 21). Kids don't have fully developed brains, and are highly emotional. All of the recent shooters were under 25. Exception for military service.

Add a national service at 18, or promote other non-political social institutions. A lot of people are disconnected from society. That contributes to both the suicide epidemic and the mass shooting problem. Long term, the solution is to improve our social fabric. When people commit mass shootings, they are almost attacking society. We need people to be integrated and feel part of something, rather than outsiders who have been rejected.

,">What are the pros and cons of legislating that Internet Service Providers must shut down access in the U.S. to the site, assuming that someone, somewhere can find a legal justification to do so that passes muster with the currently sitting Supreme Court?

Legally I cannot speak to this. But philosophically, essentially, this question is the quintessential problem of liberty. It is asking the question, ""how can we be the *freest*?"".

The problem with freedoms is that some freedoms are mutually exclusive. My freedom to safely walk down the street to buy icecream is challenged by someone else's freedom to murder me before I arrive. Obviously, *both* freedoms cannot be protected because they cannot exist at the same time, and most sane and reasonable people understand that when a conflict like this occurs, the one doing harm must yield their freedom to the one being harmed, in order to protect them. One freedom must be curtailed.

How far do we go with this? Everyone has a different answer. The [Wiccan Rede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiccan_Rede) is ""An’ ye harm none, do what ye will."", which is usually given as an answer. It means exactly what it says -- one is free to do as they wish as long as it doesn't harm someone else.

But what is *harm*, exactly? Does it have to be direct harm, as with the walking down the street argument, or... is it more complicated than that?

If I own an AK-47, some may argue that this is not an inherently harmful act. A gun is simply steel and wood in a specific shape. Excluding malfunctions and errors of use, it cannot harm anyone unless the bearer directs it; so by that definition, is it not safe, and therefore, permitted freedom to own?

Maybe, maybe not, because the presence of such a weapon inherently infringes on the freedoms of others. The freedom of the robber to break into the bearer's home and murder them is being infringed upon by the presence of the AK-47. And yet, what about the rights of the bystander? An innocent passerby hit by a stray round, unintended for that target? One could argue this is an ""error of use"", but errors of use can 100% be prevented by disallowing the item in the first place. So is that not the best approach?

Obviously, the freedom to murder innocent people must yield to the freedom to live, but it goes further than that. The freedom to live *must be inherently protected*; in a world where the police are minutes away or longer, assuming one can even contact them, the right to bear an effective firearm may well be a liberty preserving factor. 

Can we genuinely say, ""we want a world where people are *safe from accidents*?"" Can we reasonably guarantee that? Is it even theoretically possible?

What if it's not a gun we're talking about, but a 100 megatonne thermonuclear device? [Such things exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba). The Tsar Bomba too, is simply enriched uranium, explosives, and steel in a specific shape and configuration and, again, excluding malfunctions and errors of use, it cannot harm anyone unless the bearer directs it; so too, is that not safe, and therefore free to own as well?

Even the most passionate gun-rights activist usually draws the line at 100 megatonne thermonuclear devices, recognising the inherent danger of such an item. Its home defence use is... ... questionable... even if its effectiveness cannot be denied, especially as a deterrent, but even if one wanted to use it for some other purpose, there are few places in the mainland USA where such a device could be detonated safely without ""harming none"", particularly when travelling fallout and radiation are considered. So accordingly, shouldn't they be banned? Should society decide, ""there are too few legitimate use cases for such a device, and too few obvious risks, its mere existence is an existential threat to the liberty of others"", and therefore infringing on their freedom *simply by existing*, or should we respect the rights of, and yield to the discretion of, the bearer?

What is the *most free* choice?

The overuse of rhetorical questions in this response might seem inane but there really is no hard and fast rule about these kinds of problems. Society is not ""solved science"". And banning 8chan is the ""AK-47 vs thermonuclear device"" argument reconstituted into a free-speech argument. At what point is there speech that is so inherently dangerous, so inherently obviously harmful with so few even *potential* positive outcomes, that society deems it unworthy of existence? Is it even legitimate to compare firearms, let alone, hydrogen bombs to words?

It's a complex problem with no easy answer. After all, words themselves are not inherently harmful, no matter their content. To demonstrate this one could well ask the question: ""throughout all of history, how many people have been *talked* to death?"". The answer, of course, is nobody.

But we do recognise that some speech is similar, in some ways, to a thermonuclear device; expression with so few, so unlikely, positive outcomes and so many, likely, negative outcomes. Even that bastion of free speech, the USA, has long recognised that shouting ""fire!"" in a crowded theatre is not protected speech. Some would argue that ""hate speech"" is a similar gross violation of liberty; what good can come of it, and what obvious ills spring from it?

Is it worth it?

There is no clear answer. It's up to every one of us to decide, I suppose. In your mind, what restrictions on speech make us the most free? Is it legitimate to ever censor any kind of speech whatsoever, or are there lines we simply should not cross? *Can* we shout fire in a crowded theatre? *Can* we announce, and celebrate, mass shootings? *Should* places like 8Chan be allowed to exist?

The pros of disrupting the websites ability to produce content would be to scatter some of the right wing discussion boards for all of about 1 or 2 hours until they found a new home. The Cons are that there are some groups in restrictive locations with state censorship that rely on these types of sites to share news, which complicates things further. There are many other pros and cons, but for me these are rather important ones.

In my opinion (let me know it this shouldn't be said, I'll delete and rewrite it) having been on the deep web chat sites, there are enough dedicated to proper news sharing that sites like 8chan could be shut down without to much issue for the people that rely on these modes or information sharing.

,"Two vastly different questions, so I'm not sure why they're asked in parallel. Let's start with transitioning off of a fiat money supply. Here's a panel of economists responding to that: http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/gold-standard

The reason you don't want to fix a currency's price is because anything you fix that price to then influences *everything else* in the economy. If you choose gold, take a look at the price of gold over time; and know that instead of whatever inflation fluctuation we've had since dropping off the gold standard is now replaced with that graph: https://goldprice.org/

No matter what commodity you pick you induce volatility in the money supply. Any change in the market for that commodity now becomes a change in your currency. Demand for gold goes up? Currency ~~inflates~~ *deflates*. Demand goes down? Currency ~~deflates~~ *inflates*. Foreign nation decides to buy/sell large quantities of gold to manipulate exchange rates? They can do so.

I gold standard is better than having poorly managed currency, but worse than having a properly managed currency. If the government starts over-printing money... you'll see the market shift away from using that currency. But so long as the people in charge act responsibly and there's trust it's far better to not have to deal with some arbitrary commodity market influencing the money supply.

Part 2: Fractional reserve banking. 

I think what you have here is a lack of understanding about what fractional reserve lending is and how it works. Let's break things down a little:

>So in order to give you a loan for ten thousand dollars, the bank has to actually HAVE ten thousand dollars on their books to give you. 

This is the case today. Why do you think it's not?


>And once they've given that ten thousand to you, their balance goes down by ten thousand, and they cannot loan the same ten thousand dollars to anyone else at the same time. The bank cannot lend out another dollar until they receive another dollar from somewhere. Banks can no longer lend money they don't actually have.

Again, this is already the case. Banks don't really ""make"" money through fractional reserve lending... in the sense that they lend the same money out multiple times. The way it works is that the money is lent out, but that loan is usually spent and then deposited somewhere else! 

Let's walk through this with some round numbers. Bank A gets $100K dollars deposited from ""person 1"". Bank A then loans out $100K for ""person 2"" to buy a house (just pretend this is what a house costs, or replace with however much the average house in your town costs). So far this exactly follows what you propose, right? The bank has the money deposited, they make a loan against that money. Everything is legit. ""Person 2"" buys a house from ""person 3"", paying them the $100K (minus fees or whatever, just ignore that for now). What does ""person 3"" do with this money? Well, they probably deposit it in bank B... That bank now has $100K in assets against which they can make loans. Bank B isn't ""creating"" money through fractional reserve lending... they're literally getting money. What you propose above doesn't prevent bank B from making a new loan now against that $100K which was just deposited. 

In fact, it's *less* restrictive than fractional reserve lending. Fractional reserve would mean the bank lends *less* than the full $100K, because they need to keep some money on hand to address any depositors withdraw requests. It's uncommon that every depositor will request all their money on one single day, but some depositors will request some of their money every single day. Fractional reserve means the bank *can't* lend all their deposits... they have to keep a ""reserve"" buffer. For easy math, let's say that's 10%. The most the bank could loan is $90K. Even though the bank has $100K in assets deposited, they can only make loans for *less* than that amount. What you propose is actually Fractional reserve where the fraction is 0%.

Here's some background: https://www.frbatlanta.org/education/classroom-economist/fractional-reserve-banking/economists-perspective-transcript

Relevant quotes:
>There are specific reasons why it's important to understand the whole process of fractional reserve banking, and that is a lot of what economists calls ""money"" is generated through the process of fractional reserve banking. You can think of money as having two origins. First, in the old days, economists used to call ""outside money""—sometimes ""central bank money"" in your textbook, probably—""base money."" This is the currency, or the reserves, that are created by the central bank, the Federal Reserve, and [that] get put into the financial system.

>It's called base money because on top of that rests the financial system, which generates a different type of money, ""deposit money."" Deposit money, sometimes called ""inside money,"" is money that's generated through the process of fractional reserve banking. Banks take in a deposit, they let out a loan, the loan becomes another deposit, which becomes another loan, and so on and so forth. Through this process of financial intermediation, through the lending and deposits and lending and deposits, a different type of money is created that rests on top of base money.

,"I think there are good reasons that by the end of the 20th century every country in the world had transitioned off of the gold standard to a fiat currency (Switzerland was the last to do so, I believe, in 1999).  Markets are great things, but they do suffer from a number of coordination problems which can create periods of recessions or high inflation.  Fiat currencies just offer central banks a lot more ability to manage these.  The Fed can pump out additional money when required to combat real of threatening recessions just as it sets interest rates to manage inflation.

The effectiveness of these methods for preventing wild variations in financial markets, often with tragic effects for ordinary people, are well demonstrated.  The Fed issuing currency is why the 1987 stock market crash didn't have an enormous effect on the real economy and the 1929 stock market crash (of more or less the same magnitude) did. [Paul Krugman has a very nice parable which effectively demonstrates the power of monetary policy through a Capitol-Hill baby sitting Co-op](https://slate.com/business/1998/08/baby-sitting-the-economy.html).

There are risks that come with these additional tools.  First, for international investors who will find the exchange rate between currencies change on them constantly. Second, powerful tools have large consequences when misused or used irresponsibly.  This is why some countries have in modern times chosen to tie their currency's value to that of another country (Argentina used to tie the value of their Peso to the USD and Italy used to tie the value of the Lyra to the Deutsche Mark). Currencies, even of generally responsible countries, can be mismanaged so some like the idea of tying their currency to gold.

[Most economists think this would be a bad idea](https://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2012/01/23/survey-no-support-for-gold-standard-among-top-economists/).  Rigidly fixed exchange rates between countries with often very different economic realities can cause real problems.  This was quite evident in the aftermath of the 2008 recession in the Eurozone.  Countries like Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland would all have had far faster recoveries if they could have independently controlled their monetary policy instead of being tied to Germany and France.  Wide spread use of the gold standard would achieve an even less flexible version of this (no European Central Bank to make even very coarse adjustments).

Another issue, is that Gold is not actually a very stable base for a currency.  It's value is effected by shifts in supply and demand which are not related to the needs of a world economy.  [Consider this plot](https://www.sunshineprofits.com/media/cms_page_media/2018/8/19/New%20Picture.png), which shows 9x variation in the cost of gold relative to the CPI (consumer price index - an index which tries to track the general price of many essential goods).

The effects of your hypothetical changes are hard to predict.  Your changes to the credit market would be quite deflationary.  And long term, we would expect a lot volatility in the financial markets -- at least history indicates that

It's hard to predict what kind of shifts one might see from your hypothetical changes.  But your changes to the credit system and return to the gold standard would on first glance be pretty analogous to the US prior to 1933 when deposit insurance legislation was passed.  [Using that as a starting point, we'd expect a great deal of economic volatility.

,"So first and most obviously, this requires a fundamental rearrangement of the US Constitution.  So if the question is whether this can be done under the current Constitution, the answer is ""no.""^1

Specifically, this would probably require the wholesale abolition of the separately elected presidency, or else a strange hybrid system like the French Fifth Republic.^2

There are a number of challenges in implementing this, and I will now try to go through them:

* **This fundamentally changes the relationship of the President and Congress, and effectively abolishes separation of powers.**

The power to remove the President by passive inaction (failure to pass a budget) or a simple majority vote in one chamber for expressly political reasons is a drastic change to the American system of government.  The current system gives [specific separated powers](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44334.pdf) to each branch in order to act as a check on the other.  The power of removal is a drastic one which is generally overriding of almost all other checks, and would square control over the operations of government much more in the House of Representatives than anywhere else.

There are arguments this would be a good change.  Steven Teles for example [has argued](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/kludgeocracy-in-america) that the American system's veto points instead of constraining government power, result in kludge like policies which nobody supports as a first-order solution as people seek to make policy by circumventing the veto points, or by making poor policy choices to overcome them.

* **Confidence and Supply usually comes with extra powers over legislation which do not exist in the American system.**

Continuing that theme, one of the big changes would probably be in the influence the executive would have over legislation.

In the Westminster system, the government (i.e. the Prime Minister and cabinet) have general control over the legislative agenda of the principal house of the legislature.  For the budget, it is generally the case that the government's budget is the only one which may be considered, and it cannot be amended.^3

In America by contrast, [Presidential budget proposals are rarely approved.](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/presidential-budgets-rarely-get-approved/) 

If the change to a confidence and supply requirement were adopted without an amendment to let the executive directly influence legislation, it would put the executive in a very weak position in terms of facing ouster if they wanted to execute any of the normal veto powers we would come to expect from them.  In effect, the control over the budget is the Westminster system's substitute for the American presidential veto.

* **Who, exactly, gets ousted when there is a loss of confidence or supply?**

From the post here, it implies you would only be ousting the President, but that does not square with how loss of confidence or supply works in the Westminster system.  In Westminster systems, [if there is a loss of confidence,](https://www.ourcommons.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Language=E&Sec=Ch02&Seq=3) the Queen or President either picks a new PM who can maintain confidence, or else calls a snap election _of the legislature_ and keeps the old PM in place as a caretaker.

I see three possible ways a snap election could be done under this proposal:

1. The President only.

2.  The President and the House of Representatives. but not the Senate.

3.  The President, the House, and the Senate.

It is unclear which is proposed here.  If clarified I can go into the pros and cons of each one.

* **You need a tiebreaker executive function, or else rigid rules for what happens with a loss of confidence.**

As mentioned, in the Westminster system, there is a role for the Queen or the non-political President in terms of arbitrating when there is no confidence.^4  I'll just say Queen so that we don't confuse it with the American President though. In particular, the Queen has a choice about whether to allow a snap election or require the resignation or dismissal of the Prime Minister when they lose confidence or supply.  If the American President were to be subject to those requirements, there would need to be someone to make the decision, or it would have to be made in advance in the written constitution (e.g. always force a snap election).  The latter can be pretty dangerous in terms of making the constitution brittle to unforseen crises.

* **Bicameral systems handle confidence differently from supply, and it can be a problem.**

Confidence, as mentioned in the OP, is generally originating from the main elected house only.  So in a Westminster system, the government can be brought down^5 by a resolution in just the House of Commons/Representatives saying they have no confidence in the government.  

Supply on the other hand relies on the two houses together to pass a budget.  Either the lower _or_ upper house could block the budget.  This has led to major constitutional crises in the UK and Australia.

In the UK, the crisis over the [""People's budget.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Budget) being blocked by the Lords in 1909-10 resulted in the powers of the House of Lords [being greatly curtailed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911) such that the Commons is the overwhelmingly dominant legislative body, and the Lords can do little more than propose amendments and delay bills.

In Australia by contrast, the upper house is elected, and this resulted in a [major constitutional crisis in 1975.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis)  In the 1975 crisis, the Prime Minister had passed a budget through the House, but it was blocked in the Senate where the opposition held a majority, resulting in a loss of supply.  The Governor General dismissed the Prime Minister and appointed the opposition leader PM, and the opposition leader/new PM then arranged to have the original budget passed to restore supply.  The new PM then immediately was no confidence voted by the House, and a snap election resulted.  

If the US were adopting a confidence and supply system therefore, it would need to choose between the Australian system and the UK system, in terms of the powers of the Senate.  The Australian system can make the position of the executive much more precarious because they must in effect have support from two legislatures at once.  The UK system in contrast may disempower the Senate in a way that is politically unacceptable.

* **Summary**

Based on all of the above, I do not think it is possible to graft confidence and supply onto the American system.  It's too ingrained in a parliamentary structure.  To adopt it, the US would need to adopt a full parliamentary system and rethink governmental structure at a fundamental level.  It is not just ""easier impeachment"" but a basic change in where power resides and where politicians are held to account that is incompatible with the American separation of powers system.

>“Perhaps 75% of the ascent for crude oil and gasoline was tied to the usual factors; a very disciplined OPEC agreement and global demand growth that has outpaced global supply growth,” Kloza told us via email. “The withdrawal from the Iranian agreement helped promote a small geopolitical risk premium on oil, as did the continued deterioration of Venezuelan oil production and refinery output.

The Dow continues to rise, the growth which President Obama oversaw continues to set records for being the longest period of growth in recent history. 

Trump should get credit in a way, because he's really let the economy steer itself for he most part. Where I think he should take blame is where he's inserted himself.

Namely tariffs. The Tax plan wasn't his tax plan, but he did sign it and champion it, but tariffs have created ripples across the economy.

The economy is a personal thing to most voters. 

If I'm out of a job I don't care if the unemployment rate is low, even though it should mean I have an easier time of finding work.

If I'm not making money I don't care if you were able to buy a pool with your refund, or saved thousands of dollars in taxes.

If my wages don't go up, I don't care if you were able to buy back stocks for your shareholders.

So there's evidence that Trump's economy is healthy, but trending downwards. There's evidence that Trump probably could have made better decisions and enjoyed a better first two years.

,"Here are a few analyses from reputable sources on tax reform, arguably his signature economic policy achievement. The issue is that it may still be a bit too early to tell, even now, a year and a half after passage (especially in light of trade- and tariff-related uncertainty); but what impacts there have been seem (very) modestly positive thus far, which is about what most mainstream economists and models expected I think. The way to really look at something like tax reform is on a decadal timetable, not annual.

First, from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-06/trump-s-big-tax-cuts-did-little-to-boost-economic-growth): 

> Bloomberg Economics estimates the 5.5 percentage-point drop in the [corporate tax] rate led to a 1 percent boost to nonresidential investment, which added a tenth of a percentage point to gross domestic product in 2018. So without the corporate side of the TCJA, growth last year would have been 3 percent instead of 3.1 percent. That’s a much smaller boost than what White House officials had promised. In the months leading up to passage of the TCJA, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, estimated that the effect from a package of tax measures similar to those in the legislation would be “much more than 1 percent.”

It's also worth noting, on this front, the latest [capital investment numbers](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/a-decline-in-capital-investment-reveals-the-false-promise-of-trumps-tax-bill) suggest a sharp drop. That link goes to a *New Yorker* article worth reading on the subject.

And from the [Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/tcja-one-year-later/), a respected think tank:

> All told, the Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth model estimates that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase long-run GDP by 1.7 percent, create 339,000 jobs, and raise wages by 1.5 percent. It will reduce federal revenues by $1.47 trillion on a conventional basis and $448 billion on a dynamic basis over the 10-year budget window...Now that we’re a year out since the law’s passage, what evidence can we point to on how the Act has impacted the U.S economy? The answer is, very little. First, the law’s design is such that the economic impacts are long-run. It takes several years for the lower cost of capital to impact investment...Second, it is always difficult to spot the impact of policy changes in economic data. Economic data is noisy...Third, other policy changes mitigate the impacts of tax reform on the U.S. economy. 

Lastly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issues an [annual outlook that includes economic forecasts](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54918). The below is from chapter 2, and covers taxes as well as spending:

> Three pieces of legislation enacted in the past fiscal year significantly affected fiscal policy and the economic outlook. The first, the 2017 tax act, permanently lowered the top corporate income tax rate to 21 percent and changed the way that businesses’ foreign income is taxed. The act also lowered individual income tax rates and broadened the base of income subject to tax through 2025. In addition, it included provisions that affect the way businesses and individuals calculate their taxable income. The two other pieces of legislation affected spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) increased the caps on discretionary funding for 2018 and 2019 and provided substantial funding for emergency assistance. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141), provided total appropriations for discretionary accounts near the level of the newly increased caps. Taken together, the three pieces of legislation generated a substantial fiscal stimulus, which supported strong economic growth in 2018 and is expected to continue to facilitate output growth in the first three quarters of 2019.

CBO expects real GDP growth of 1.7% in the next few years, but I think most of this is not because of policy changes. Also note the increased caps in 2018 and 2019 are about to be increased [again for 2020 and 2021](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/house-passes-budget-debt-limit-deal), adding more stimulus to the economy via deficit spending, which CBO didn't include.

The obvious downside to all this is that it cuts revenues and increases deficits, which in the long run allows national debt to pile up. And [this picture is getting scary, per CBO](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55331).

Take for instance that so far in 2019 US Manufacturing has been in a slump, but service sector employment is solid. Most job growth has been in the service sector which traditionally pays less than manufacturing too.

But real wages have been a problem under multiple administrations dating back to around Carter/Reagan. This hasn't changed much under Trump. There are several causes, from the reduction in union representation, free trade that moved many good paying jobs overseas but also a big jump in automation. No one item by itself led to this. Kind of a perfect storm of bad news.

This Forbes contributor lays out some of the micro dynamics of our current economy. He (I think rightly) questions the judgement of holding wages stagnant and funneling ever increasing production gains into the pockets of the wealthiest shareholders. And if anybody thinks that the stock market helps most people, it doesn't: most estimates have around 80% of all stocks owned by only 10% of the US, with total % of citizens that hold any stock only at 54%.

Additionally, stocks and options cannot be substituted for wages. One can't eat stocks and they cannot take shelter in them. Any liquidation of a stock today to pay a bill necessarily greatly reduces the gains that stock can potentially make down the road. That just isn't what stocks are meant for.

So no, I don't think more tax cuts to the rich is working. I also don't blame just Trump for this philosophy, as it has been around forever and has been dominant since the 70s, but he absolutely is touting it as not just a good general principle but his own set of genius ideas.

,"The easiest way to reform the Electoral College would be to repeal the [Apportionment Act of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapportionment_Act_of_1929) and stipulate that there shall be 1 Representative for every 200,000 residents of a state.

The Apportionment Act of 1929 put a limit of 435 Representatives in the House.  This had a knock-on effect of limiting the expansion of electoral votes from 1930 and onward, because the number of total electoral votes is based on 2 Senators per state, plus the number of Representatives per state.  

If the 1929 act is repealed, and replaced with a new act that sets the number of Representatives at 1 per 200,000 residents it would increase the size of the House (which could be argued as beneficial for different reasons) and subsequently making the Electoral College larger.

Making the Electoral College larger would reduce the effective power smaller states like Vermont or Wyoming, have in deciding the Presidential election.  

Right now, Wyoming has a population of less than 600,000 (3 EVs) vs California of 40 million (55 EVs).  This gives California only about a 17:1 electoral advantage.  

If the House is expanded to 1 Representative for every 200,000 residents, Wyoming would receive 5 EVs, while California would receive over 200 EVs.  This would give California an electoral advantage of 40:1.

Why do this instead of some other method of Electoral College Reform?  Because it is the easiest, in terms of the Constitution, since it doesn't require amending it - it would be a simple bill passed in Congress.",mclumber1,,cjsxjz,evn2fqe

Or just make the whole system simpler and do a damn popular vote.

---

With apologies, your question is really oddly phrased OP. So I'm just going to give an overview of all the issues with the electoral college.

The biggest issue most take with the Electoral vote is that it disagrees with the popular [vote semi-regularly in close elections.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcZTTB10_Vo) For this, the biggest factor is that most states (excepting Maine and Nebraska) apportion their electors in a [winner take all manner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_elections). If all states did so proportionally, the disagreement (percentage wise) between the EC and Popular Vote would be comparably small. 

Here is a site that shows [potential results with proportional elector allocation \(select ""Proportional Popular \(PVS\)""\)](https://www.270towin.com/alternative-electoral-college-allocation-methods/?year=2012). In the 2012 election for example, if we ignore 3rd party/other voting, then Obama got 52.0% of the popular vote but 61.7% of the electoral college vote. In a PVS scheme, he would have gotten 52.2% of the electoral vote. **The disagreement between the two goes from large to very small.** 

Now you noticed I'm talking about 2012 and not 2016 didn't you? That's because there's a significant amount of votes for 3rd parties in 2016. In the popular vote for 2016, neither candidate got a majority. In a PVS scheme, neither gets a majority of EC votes either (which is good, there's more agreement between EC and popular vote as there was in a 2012 PVS scheme). [And that pushes the election to an awkward tiebreaker which I don't want to get into right now.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824_United_States_presidential_election)

Additionally, with proportional voting even 'Red' states will have some electors vote for Democrats and vice-versa. So it doesn't matter that California has so many EC votes and Wyoming so few. Everybody's vote is actually going to matter.

EDIT: I also argue this would be *relatively easy*. Its drawback is it would require 50 different states to agree to change their voting style, or (harder) a constitutional amendment to take away elector allocation from the states. But when you consider that 15 states have already adopted [a more extreme interstate compact on elector allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact), perhaps this isn't really all that far fetched.

---

A second issue, that is often erroneously mentioned as the bigger issue, is that small states are over-represented in the electoral college. This is true, however it is not nearly as significant as many make out. It doesn't really pass a sanity check, because small states are split between Red and Blue (small states in the heartland are Red, equally small states in New England and the Mid-Atlantic are Blue). Indeed, to bring back the 2012 example, this would only account for, at most, .2% of disagreement between a proportional EC vote and a popular vote. Let's address this issue anyway.

The number of electors a state receives is determined as follows: # electors = # House members + # senators. The number of senators is 2 for every state. The smallest states still get at least 1 house member, so they have at least 3 electors.

Based on the 2010 census, Here is [the number of representatives per population for each state](https://kids.kiddle.co/images/7/7d/Pop_per_rep.png). Most states are pretty close to the average of 711,000 people per house representative. The states that do deviate (Wyoming, Montana, Rhode Island, etc.) are small states and have very few representatives, so the magnitude of this misrepresentation in the face of 435 total representatives is small. We also see that the misrepresentation is kind of random (some small states are over represented, some under).

The bigger issue is that every state gets 2 electors 'for free' from their number of senators. Based on the 2010 census, [here is the number of electors per population for each state and DC](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f0bb181f4419530fa663bba903f8f45e). See how much more lobsided it is in comparison to the above? See how the misrepresentation is much more consistent (large states underrepresented consistently)?

You can fix this by having the number of electors from a state being closer to their percentage of the total US population. I suggest having the number of electors be equal to the number of house members (nix the free '2' electors for senators). Many people often suggest increasing the number of house representatives, which would also increase the total number of electors. But in my mind, this is overkill and you'd have to seriously increase the number of house members (at least 1000), and [make it the biggest legislative chamber in the world \(in a democracy\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislatures_by_number_of_members), which would introduce logistical problems in the House.

With all this said and done, I really do want to emphasize that EC misrepresentation is overblown as an issue. By far the larger issue is the winner take all voting scheme.

Finally:

> In the case of removal, with the fact that more Democratic voters exist than Republican, could the system be balanced so that Democrats do not always win the presidency?

If more people agree with the Democratic party election after election, it is no issue in my opinion that only Democrats would be elected. However, this will not happen in the long term. The reason the parties are set up like they are is because they evolve over time to be roughly competitive with half of the voting power in the country. All this would do is change the voting power from some abstraction of the voters, to the actual voters themselves. You would see subtle changes in the GOP and Democrats to realign around 50-50 again.",Apprentice57,,cjsxjz,evuwkhs
,"Could you explain exactly what you mean by, ""an imbalance in voting with states that count for more votes, such as New York, California, Texas?"" Does the electoral college actually favor larger or smaller states? What would a 'balanced' electoral college look like?

One example of potential electoral reform is the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact). Because states have the ability to choose how their electors vote, if enough states and electoral votes agree to do so then they can turn the presidential election into effectively a popular vote, ""reforming"" the electoral college by sidestepping it.

The big advantage of a national popular vote over the current electoral system is that it kills the idea of a swing state. If a state tends to have a clear majority of one party, then there's not much point in investing much time or money campaigning in that state. Instead, they focus on states which could conceivably vote in either direction and tip the election in their favor. As seen [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/11/01/163632378/a-campaign-map-morphed-by-money), where money is spent isn't at all related to the size of the state.

Missing a vote entirely can be viewed very negatively.

As you noted, Warren, Sanders, and Harris all abstained from voting. All three will be forced to miss some votes while on the campaign trail, so by abstaining while present in the Senate, they will limit the number of missed votes and weaken that potential line of attack. 

For this vote, 15 Senators abstained. If all 15 voted to override the veto, that would still keep them 7 votes short of the 67 votes needed. So they didn't really have any impact here. Of course, there are a mix of Republicans and Democrats here, so we can't assume all would be in support of overriding the veto. Because of the nature of the current administration, some Republicans who wanted to override may not want to upset the President by going against him.

,">I want to use this as a springboard to understand better how military justice and civilian justice interplay in different countries.

You may need to be more specific; with over 190 countries in the world, you're talking about over 190 different possible scenarios. Other posters have already discussed the extraordinary justice system: where the military system has its own insulated court system separate from the local one, often with higher priority due to diplomatic or sovereignty concerns. These tend to be rife with accusations of biased self-interest, much like when any organization (e.g., police departments, corporations) perform their own internal investigations. But since this type has been covered by other posers, I think it'll be worth my mentioning the opposite end of the spectrum: no military justice system. In particular, Japan -- at least until very recently.

Japan is technically not allowed[1] to have a military as per Article 9 of its constitution:


>""...In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.""


So on paper, Japan's military is just a civilian government ministry... that just so happens to use tanks and planes. And as a civilian ministry, it lacks many of the privileges its peers have in other nations, such as a extraordinary court system, which is prohibited by Article 76:


>“No extraordinary tribunal shall be established, nor shall any organ or agency of the Executive be given final judicial power.""


It also lacks other types of special powers, like martial law, or military secrets protections (i.e., harsher version of confidentially laws specifically for military secrets (at least until 2013, when the [State Secrecy Law was passed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/whistleblowers-japan-crackdown-state-secrets))). It's an interesting example to look at for anyone interested in examining how non-conventional military structures work, especially for those interested in privatized military forces -- which have a similarly ambiguous civilian-but-not status.

[1] Arguably until July 2014, when Japan's courts formally reinterpreted the meaning of the article to broaden its powers. Followed up by a September 2015 change to the laws.

 Military courts have a lot more power if there is some sort of failing in civilian courts that prevent them from functioning; [this is a fairly accurate description of martial law](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/martial%20law).  In our country, martial law is typically synonymous with the [activation of the suspension clause](https://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_mlaw.html), [which can be activated during war or rebellion](https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/suspension-clause/), i.e. acute and existential security crises.

a lot of power.

Mormons are to monogamous statutes as anti-vaxxers are to vaccine requirements for enrollment.

Public education is an assumed right because of the 14th amendment.

,">How soon can it happen? Even if the prosecutors begin preparing a case in November, as soon as the election result shows that the sitting president is about to leave office, do they have to wait until he formally leaves office in January before they can convene a grand jury to consider an indictment? Or could they be ready to serve an indictment the moment the next president takes the oath of office? Or is every US Attorney obligated by ethics or policy to leave that matter to his or her successor if the incoming president chooses to appoint a new one?

Arrest can take place before indictment.  A federal officer like an FBI agent would need to swear out a warrant application before a federal judge, which if approved would give the basis to arrest someone.  There would then be [thirty days](https://federaldefendersny.org/information-for-client-and-families/understanding-my-federal-case.html) for the Grand Jury to convene and hear an indictment.

My suspicion however is that given the nature of the case, they would want to indict prior to arrest.  Federal judges are not stupid, and they're going to raise an eyebrow if you try to claim exigency about needing to arrest the former President as a flight risk.

In any event it is extremely unlikely that the Trump DoJ would initiate steps towards charging President Trump, since AG Barr has been willing to bend over backwards to take highly favorable positions to Trump's personal liability, including [asserting without analysis that Trump did not commit obstruction of justice offenses in respect to the Mueller probe.](https://www.justsecurity.org/64391/the-missing-bill-barr-obstruction-analysis/)  So as a matter of practicality, this would be left to the incoming Attorney General.

As to state charges (e.g. if New York wanted to indict him for state income tax evasion), that process could begin any time, and they could have sealed indictments and arrest warrants waiting for noon on January 20 if they really wanted.  Though to execute those on their own terms he would need to be in New York State.  Otherwise they would need to get the other state's authorities to arrest him and go through an extradition process to bring him to New York.

>Former presidents are guaranteed Secret Service protection for life; can the former president direct the Secret Service to block authorities who are trying to execute a lawful arrest warrant? Can anyone else direct the Secret Service to stand down?

If we're talking about federal charges, the Secret Service would be the odds-on candidate to be doing the arresting.  Far from being told to stand down, as [sworn federal law enforcement officers](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3056) they would be obliged to execute the arrest.  [The standard form arrest warrant](https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/ao442.pdf) reads:

>>To: Any authorized law enforcement officer
YOU ARE COMMANDED to arrest and bring before a United States magistrate judge without unnecessary delay
(name of person to be arrested) 
who is accused of an offense or violation based on the following document filed with the court:

For state charges, I don't think there's anything public I can find, but on pure speculation the Secret Service would likely (after verifying the warrant's authenticity) allow the arrest and accompany the protectee to jail and continue guarding him in jail.

I'd also add as an addendum to this - it's likely if criminal charges were brought, there would be no arrest at all.  Trump is not a huge flight risk, especially because he is probably the single most visibly recognizable human being on Earth.  He can't hide anywhere without people noticing him.  Moreover, he is not accused of violent offenses or anything which poses immediate danger to others.  He would almost certainly be allowed to voluntarily surrender at a courthouse and not be arrested by surprise.  This would still generally be an ""arrest,"" [See, e.g. this WA opinion](https://www.atg.wa.gov/ago-opinions/accepting-custody-person-who-voluntarily-surrenders-arrest-warrant) but it avoids the weird uncertainties about arresting a Secret Service protectee.

>If the former president relocates to a country with no extradition treaty, can he or she keep Secret Service protection there? Or is anyone involved in the relocation potentially guilty of aiding a fugitive?

I wouldn't think so?  First, I don't think the Secret Service would agree to give a fugitive protection.  And they'd need permission of the host government to carry guns and other Secret Service like stuff. 

In any event, I don't think there's any real risk of Trump fleeing to another country to evade prosecution.  

>The statute of limitations for some crimes in question requires charges to be filed within five years. If the president is re-elected and that clock therefore runs out in his or her second term, can prosecutors still argue that the statue of limitations is suspended (""tolled"") while the president is in office and immune to prosecution? Are there other likely charges with longer statutes of limitations? Might the tolling question be decided differently for state charges instead of federal charges?

Unclear.  There is obviously no direct precedent because no former President has been charged with a crime. [This is an interesting article about the question of equitable tolling as applied to Trump.](https://www.lawfareblog.com/equitable-tolling-and-prosecution-president)

,"TL:DR Yes, a former President can be indicted after office by a state or territorial judiciary.

As for your Secret Service point, the incumbent POTUS always has the final say on what the Secret Service does. So let's lay out the scenario:

-The President has the power to pardon any federal crime or crime in the District of Columbia.

-The current President is the most important person for the Secret Service to protect. If, for example, a former president were to try and murder the current president, the Secret Service would kill the former president without a second thought.

-The next president is either from the opposition or is a reelectee.

-Since a reelectee cannot be indicted, we can assume, for argument's sake, that the opposition wins the election. It will happen eventually, because of how the two main political parties in the United States are organized, and becauae of the consistently present [political pendulum](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/political-pendulum/).

We now know that the President has a chance at getting indicted right after leaving office. He/she has a chance of preempting such a scenario.

The current President could leave office and admit guilt to a crime. The VP, who assumes the role as new President, can now pardon the resigned and guilty President of all federal crimes, in exchange for the rest of the former President's term. [This was the case when President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon when he resigned in his second term.](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/STATUTE-88/STATUTE-88-Pg2502)

* **What could the DoJ or others punish Mueller for saying?**

* **What can DoJ give Mueller cover to decline to say?**

Using [the letter DoJ sent to him](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m91TjGuoUubq1iCbx6wmawAcGWsEGypD/view) I will go from what I think the weakest cases are to the strongest cases.

**Weakest**

* *Non-privilege DoJ policy*

The letter relies on [DoJ policy](https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-27000-principles-federal-prosecution#9-27.760) to state that information should not be given on uncharged parties.  This I do not think should hold up to a demand that the information be provided to Congress under subpoena.  As the policy notes, it does not overcome court orders to provide the information, and there's no reason to believe a court order would be any less valid than a Congressional order.  DoJ policy is not [a legally cognizable testimonial privilege.](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6205&context=jclc)

**Less weak**

The DoJ letter then goes on to cite five privileges (which it all cites as ""executive privilege"" or a subcategory thereof).

* *Law enforcement privilege*

[Law enforcement investigatory privilege](https://secure.heylroyster.com/_data/files/Articles%20Chapters/180213%20IDC%20Quarterly%20Perkins%20and%20Heil%20Law%20Enforcement%20Investigatory%20Privilege.PDF) is a privilege which ""prohibits the release of governmental information – whether through
documentary evidence or oral testimony – that would harm an agency’s investigative or enforcement efforts. ""  This could apply to some specific investigative details, e.g. use of wiretaps or methods of finding foreign intelligence information in Russia.  Though DoJ says this is a subset of executive privilege, no support is provided for that and I could find none.

* *Deliberative process privilege*

[Deliberative process privilege](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45653.pdf) is a ""prong of executive privilege that protects pre-decisional and deliberative agency communications.""  It is limited in scope however, and can ""yield to Congress’s 'legitimate need' for the information. 

* *Attorney work product privilege*

[Attorney work product privilege](https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-counselor-attorney-work-product-protection) is a privilege protecting ""materials prepared by an attorney or others in anticipation of litigation, preserving the adversarial trial process by shielding materials which would disclose the attorney's theory of the case or trial strategy.""

The privilege has been found to apply to government lawyers in the FOIA context, but I'm not sure about if it would apply in this context.  It would also only apply to materials prepared in anticipation of an adversarial process, and not in respect to e.g. the counterintelligence portion of Mueller's probe.  It's also unclear if it would apply to materials relating to the President given the Mueller report's indication that the SCO did not consider charging him because of the DoJ guidance saying they couldn't. [Mueller Report Introduction to Vol II, p. 1](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report_volume2.pdf)

* *Executive privilege*

Executive privilege relates to communications between the President himself and senior government officials.  It can be overcome on a showing of need, most famously as held in the [Nixon Watergate tapes case.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Nixon) It would not apply to any pre-government conduct, or to any communications with non-government personnel, such as Trump's instructing Corey Lewendowski to tell Jeff Sessions to end the obstruction investigation of him. (Mueller Report vol II p. 90-93)

**Strongest**

* *Judicial gag orders*

There are also gag orders in place in two of the cases Mueller's office brought.  These are federal court orders specifically barring the government or defense from publicly commenting on the case.  They are in [US v. Concord Management](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6186822/Sealed-Order.pdf) and [US v.

Smoking? Combat? Wait Till 21, Young Recruits Say

,">More than a dozen countries, including the United Kingdom, already have adopted the policy.

The UK is the only European country to have a minimum recruitment age of 16 (with parental consent).

[The other countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_enlistment_age_by_country) are Bahrain (15, for cadets), Bangladesh (16, voluntary), Bolivia (16, voluntary), Egypt (15, voluntary), El Salvador (16, voluntary), Guinea-Bissau (16, voluntary with parental consent), Iran (15, voluntary for the Basij, 16 for the army), Kazakhstan (15, for cadets), Kyrgyzstan (16, for cadets), Mexico (16, voluntary with parental consent), Pakistan (16, voluntary), Russia (16, for cadets), Singapore (16, voluntary), Tajikistan (15, for cadets), and Turkmenistan (15, for cadets).

It's interesting that the article only mentions the UK and does so in a manner that implies younger recruitment ages are part of a trend.

And the UK's young recruitment age is deeply unpopular with the public.  [A recent survey by ICM Research](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/29/uk-army-minimum-recruitment-age-survey) found 72% of Britons felt the minimum recruitment age should be raised to 18 (and one in ten felt it should be 21).",OG_slinger,,cg97ge,euglbwl
,"[In the US you generally need a high school diploma to be eligible for military service](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/join-the-military-basic-eligibility.html).  It's not common for 16 year olds to complete high school.  So, many or most would be basically dropping out, against stated policies --  [32 states consider school attendance compulsory until at least 17 years old](http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/upper-compulsory-school-age.aspx).

&#x200B;

Even if those issues are reconciled, while it may seem beneficial from the recruitment side, it would certainly be a negative for the teenager since they would likely end up having an uphill battle without one once their service is complete -- [it's harder to get a job](https://www.mau.com/career-tips/can-you-get-a-great-paying-job-without-a-high-school-diploma) and there are reduced opportunities for college enrollment.",tasunder,,cg97ge,eugi87x

,"I can think of a few main problems with lowering the enlistment age.

1) Younger soldiers are more likely to develop PTSD. [This](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2167702612469355) study (pdf), about Vietnam vets shows that in likely hood to develop PTSD 

> Age was also a substantial factor; men who entered Vietnam at an age under 25 were nearly 7 times as likely (25.8%) to have PSS onset, compared to men 25 or older (3.7% PSS onset). 

Now this study only looks at an over/under of 25 years old, but it stands to reason that the percent change is correlated to age.  A 24 year old would have a smaller chance then a 21 year old who would have a smaller chance then an 18 year old to develop PTSD. If we continue that trend, a 16 year old would have a still greater chance to develop PTSD. Note that PSS is  PTSD symptom syndrome.  This means you show all the symptoms of PTSD.

&#x200B;

2) From the same study, 

> There were small to moderate correlations (.20–.27) of harm with younger age, having no more than a high school education, and having had a family member arrested.  

Harm in this case is defined as

> “terrorizing,  wounding,  or  killing  civilians”  and  “torturing,  wounding,  or  killing  hostages  or  prisoners of war.” 

Young kids without a high school education (16 years olds) would harm prisoners of war and civilians more then older people who have more education (18 year olds or college/high school grads). That (aside from being bad in its own right) is one of the reasons younger soldiers get PTSD at a higher rate then older soldiers.

3) Not very many 16 year olds can drive. From [This](http://www.umich.edu/~umtriswt/PDF/UMTRI-2016-4.pdf) study (pdf), in 2014 only 24.5% of 16 year olds have a license, compared to 60.1% of 18 year olds (or 76.7% of 20-24 year olds).  These percentages have been decreasing since the 80's so they are probably even lower in 2019. The military would have to teach most of those kids how to drive normally, then teach them how to drive military vehicles. Side note, do you need a license to drive in a military vehicle?

&#x200B;

4) Once you get out, you will probably have very few employment options. The average length of service for an enlisted person in 2009 was [6.7 years](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/05/chapter-6-a-profile-of-the-modern-military/) (probably a bit longer today). Somebody who joins when the are 16 would leave the service at 23-24 years. Without a high school diploma and with likely no employable skills other then the job they did in the military (which may or may not have a counter part in civilian life), I would imagine it would be rather tough finding a job and adapting to civilian life. According to the BLS, in 2013 only [27%](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2014/article/education-level-and-jobs.htm) of jobs nation wide are available to people without a high school diploma or equivalent. If you they manage to land a job, you can look foreword to a median annual wage of $20,350, likely a pay cut from  their time in service.",RalftheBucket,,cg97ge,euhkpjg
,"To really explore this issue requires an understanding of the difference between [positive rights and negative rights.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights) Positive rights oblige an action (by the government) while negative rights oblige inaction. Put [another way:](https://www.libertarianism.org/media/around-web/negative-rights-vs-positive-rights)

> Fundamentally, positive rights require others to provide you with either a good or service. A negative right, on the other hand, only requires others to abstain from interfering with your actions.

Traditionally, rights under US law are negative rights. The principle is that people are born free to act as they will and their right to do so is guaranteed by the government obligating itself not to interfere. This is why the rights guaranteed in the [US Bill of Rights](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/) are framed in the negative: ""Congress shall make no law…"" 

The US Constitution doesn't require the government to provide the kinds of goods and services on your list. The services it does obligate, [like a fair trial or enforcement of contracts,](http://volokh.com/2013/05/07/positive-rights-the-constitution-and-conservatives-and-moderate-libertarians/) are those designed to protect the rights already enjoyed by the people.

So, under a traditional US view, a citizen doesn't have a *right* to the protection of a fire department. Many citizens may have that *desire*, and if enough of them get together and propose it to their local government, actions may be taken to provide that service. But it's still a service. Just because people consider it essential does not make it a ""right"" under a traditional US view. The same would apply to the ""right"" to health care.

But rights are viewed differently in other parts of the world, as demonstrated by the [UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights.](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html) Although it includes elements that are parallel to the US' negative rights, it also includes many positive rights, such as the rights to food, clothing, housing and social services, obligating others (usually by way of taxation and actions of the governing body) to provide those goods and services. This more expansive view of rights is what most people are talking about when they refer to ""Basic Human Rights."" Such a view makes it easier to argue for the government providing a particular service, because if we call it a ""basic human right,"" it gets incorporated it into this paradigm.",nosecohn,,ceiiny,eu3kihs
,"**1. Basic Human Rights Defined.**

""Basic human rights"" is a political term, not a legal term. The major international law conventions establishing human rights do not use this term whatsoever. (Source: I studied international human rights law in law school. The United Nations has a great [list](https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/human-rights/) of all major international human rights lawmaking treaties, and if you look through each treaty, you'll see the term never appears). Neither the United States Constitution nor any state constitution to my knowledge uses this term, and these are for the most part the documents that create human rights in the United States. (Source: see above, but this time, just search the [text](https://constitutionus.com/) of the US constitution for basic human rights; the words never appear). 

There is a possibility that those using the term ""basic human rights"" are using it as a synonym for the legal term ""fundamental human rights."" This term does not appear in US jurisprudence, but it does appear internationally. International law regularly uses the terms ""fundamental human rights"" and ""fundamental freedoms"", but with little real meaning. The international lawmaking conventions protecting human rights are only supposed to protect the most important human rights and freedoms -- that is to say, the fundamental rights and freedoms. So in essence, if an international convention a right/freedom, it must be fundamental because otherwise, it wouldn't be included in the convention. You can really see this in action in the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf), which repeatedly uses the ""fundamental"" term without ever defining or really applying it.

**Basic Human Rights in the United States**

The United States uses neither the terms ""fundamental human right"" nor the term ""basic human right,"" but does significantly use the term ""fundamental right."" The federal courts have consistently recognized certain highly important rights as fundamental, specifically those explicitly identified in the US Constitution or found to exist under the due process clause. Government attempts to limit fundamental rights are subject to strict scrutiny, meaning that a court will strike down such a limitation unless the government can prove that the limitation is narrowly tailored to accomplish a compelling state purpose. (Source for entire paragraph: law school, but also, [LII](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fundamental_right), which has a great discussion of this topic and a great discussion of strict scrutiny to boot)). Examples of fundamental human rights in the United States include the freedom of speech, freedom of marriage, and right to vote.

**Arguments Regarding What Should Constitute Basic/Fundamental (Human) Rights/Freedoms**

,"The [UN's Declairation of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) is a 30 point article describing what those rights are.

Anecdotally I would describe ""Basic Human rights"" as the absolute minimum rights that any member of society is entitled to without relegating them to the role of a second class citizen. Basically these are the rights that are required to have a society that treats its citizens fairly and equally while allowing them to have agency over their own life.

**Edit:** Here's a compiled list of various politian's short explainations for why they are for/against treating health care as basic human right: https://healthcare.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=001602

I think the most interesting argument for is David Kucinich who argues that the Preamble of the constitution states that one of the goals of founding our nation is to ""Promote the general welfare"" and relates that back to providing health care.

Those against the notion mostly seem to mostly have a few main points:
1) Healthcare is a service, not a right. It's a commodity to be bought and sold. Not something inherent to the human condition.

2) Declaring healthcare as a human right requires someone to provide something for someone else ""for free"", perhaps against their will.

3) Not allowing the market forces of supply and demand to dictate prices of medical service will raise costs overall.

Or at least that's my best summation of the arguments.",Fresh_C,,ceiiny,eu3gh9w

While this works fine as a LIMIT to the government's actions, this amendment is why US law cannot declare Health Care as a ""right"".  By re-defining services provided by the government as a right, the amendment could then be construed to mean that citizens have a right to, not only, all services that the government provides, but also, all those it does not.

,"So i'm going to go down these question by question if I have an answer for each as best as I can understand them. 

for the first bit I would look toward the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights). This has both a test for if something can be considered a human right and a list of things that can be considered human rights. The test basically says Human Rights are those that stem from protecting liberty, equality, and dignity of humans (also brotherhood but I can't find a way that this can be fundamentally violated without the others falling before). This mean to violate any humans ability to freely decide things that affect their life, their ability to achieve according to their ability what others in their society can, or to deprive them of life would intrinsically violate their rights. This is a pretty good standard overall I think because it allows for flexibility in time and a way to judge unimaginable crimes against humanity. 


Listed human rights include: right to life, opinion/speech, religion, association, healthcare, and freedom from slavery.

In the United states we have more [Statutory Rights](https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/statutory-right/) than human rights. While some of these overlap it is important to know that until a lawmaker writes it down and a judge rules on it, no right is acknowledged in the US. that being said we have a collection of statutory rights that are meant to provide people with human rights in the US. look to the [first and eighth amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States) as well as not as hard to pass things like the [voting rights act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965). in short I think it is just contradictory to think of ""Human Rights"" in US law as fundamentally protected, you have to find a bit that covers that human right and most of the time these come up they are written in a [""for thee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) [not for](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/) [me""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States) kind of way.

,"Lawyer here.  

Essentially, [INA § 208\(a\)\(1\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1158) says ""*any* alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States...irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section.""  

208(a)(2)(A) acts as a limitation on those who can apply for asylum in the first place.  It says that if there is a bilateral/multilateral agreement b/t the US and another country (but not the immigrant's native country) which allows the US to remove immigrants to that country, then that is what *must* be done, unless: 

A) the Attorney General determines that it is in the public interest to grant asylum the immigrant, or

B) the immigrant's life or freedom would be threatened in that country due to their status with respect to an enumerated protected class (race, religion, etc.), or

C) the alien would not have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection in that country

**Basically 208(a)(2)(A) provides one option for denying asylum claims based on a treaty with another safe country, provided the immigrant fits within the provisions of that treaty.  But that is not the only option.**

The new IFR, however, is based on the *eligibility requirements* for asylum found in INA § 208(b)(2).  That section contains a list of special circumstances that will make an immigrant ineligible for asylum.  208(b)(2)(C) further provides that the Attorney General may issue regulations that *add new circumstances* to this list, provided that those regulations are consistent with the rest of § 208.  *This* is the section providing the legal basis for the new IFR.  

The new eligibility requirement basically states that if the immigrant has not applied for asylum somewhere outside of their native country, the country where they have citizenship, or the country where they last legally resided, then they are ineligible for asylum. This is different from 208(a)(2)(A), because no treaty is required, and it requires affirmative action on the part of the immigrant, which is irrelevant for the purposes of 208(a)(2)(A).  As with the other eligibility requirements, the asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing that the bar at issue does not apply. 8 CFR
1240.8(d); see also, e.g., Rendon v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 967, 973 (9th Cir. 2008) (applying 8 CFR 1240.8(d) in the context of the aggravated felony bar to asylum).  

So the ultimate question is whether this new eligibility requirement is consistent with the rest of § 208.  As the [new IFR](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-15246.pdf) states, ""the Attorney General has previously invoked section 208(b)(2)(C) of the INA to
limit eligibility for asylum based on a 'fundamental change in circumstances' and on the ability of an applicant to safely relocate internally within the alien’s country of nationality or of last habitual residence. See Asylum Procedures, 65 FR 76121, 76126 (Dec. 6, 2000).""  The IFR also notes that courts have upheld the Attorney General's determinations under 208(b)(2)(C) when used to render aliens ineligible for asylum based on fraud. See R-S-C, 869
F.3d at 1187; Nijjar v. Holder, 689 F.3d 1077, 1082 (9th Cir. 2012).

**On its face, the new eligibility requirement MAY OR MAY NOT be inconsistent with § 208.**  One might argue that the other eligibility requirements are designed to exclude asylum applicants that have committed various wrongs in the past or present a danger to the US, while the new requirement is different in that it requires affirmative action of otherwise innocent applicants.  However, the statute does not say that the Attorney General's broad discretion to publish new requirements is limited on these lines.  

A better argument is that the new requirement undermines the Safe Third Country application requirement, 208(a)(2)(A), because it essentially forces the alien to be removed to countries where they might not be safe in order to first apply for asylum there or elsewhere, even though this is explicitly one of the circumstances where 208(a)(2)(A) would not apply as a bar to asylum.  In other words, it would be inconsistent with that section if an immigrant were permitted to apply for asylum based on such risk of persecution in a country that has such a treaty with the US, only to remove the immigrant to that country because they failed to apply for asylum there or elsewhere first. The IFR anticipates and contests this argument:

>if an alien proves that it is more likely than not that the alien’s life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground, but is denied asylum for some other reason—for instance, because of a statutory exception, an eligibility bar adopted by regulation, or a discretionary denial of asylum—the alien nonetheless may be entitled to statutory withholding of removal if not otherwise barred from that form of protection.

However, withholding of removal ([INA § 241(b)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1231)) has a much higher standard (clear probability of/more likely than not that applicant's life or liberty would be threatened) than the standard for asylum (a well-founded fear of future persecution, presumptively assumed if applicant has experienced past persecution and demonstrates that the circumstances causing the persecution persist).  Furthermore, there is no analogous exception allowing withholding of removal to 208(a)(2)(A)'s exception for the alien not having ""access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection in that country"".

Another confounding issue is that a grant of asylum also requires, after everything else, the favorable exercise of discretion.  See Matter of Pula.  In other words, even applicants meeting all of the eligibility requirements can be denied asylum for various reasons.  The discretion of the agency is very broad in general when it comes to hearing asylum claims.",BalloraStrike,,cdkxkk,etv7udu

Specifically, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are revising 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c) and 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(c) to add a new bar to eligibility for asylum for an alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States across the southern border, but who did not apply for protection from persecution or torture where it was available in at least one third country outside the alien’s country of citizenship, nationality, or last lawful habitual residence through which he or she transited en route to the United States.

Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan issued the following statement:

""While the recent supplemental funding was absolutely vital to helping confront the crisis, the truth is that it will not be enough without targeted changes to the legal framework of our immigration system. Until Congress can act, this interim rule will help reduce a major 'pull' factor driving irregular migration to the United States and enable DHS and DOJ to more quickly and efficiently process cases originating from the southern border, leading to fewer individuals transiting through Mexico on a dangerous journey. Ultimately, today's action will reduce the overwhelming burdens on our domestic system caused by asylum-seekers failing to seek urgent protection in the first available country, economic migrants lacking a legitimate fear of persecution, and the transnational criminal organizations, traffickers, and smugglers exploiting our system for profits.”

The bar is subject to three limited exceptions, including:

(1) an alien who demonstrates that he or she applied for protection from persecution or torture in at least one of the countries through which the alien transited en route to the United States, and the alien received a final judgment denying the alien protection in such country;

(2) an alien who demonstrates that he or she satisfies the definition of “victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons” provided in 8 C.F.R. § 214.11; or,

(3) an alien who has transited en route to the United States through only a country or countries that were not parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol, or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

Asylum is a discretionary benefit offered by the United States Government to those fleeing persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.

Attorney General William P. Barr issued the following statement:

“This Rule is a lawful exercise of authority provided by Congress to restrict eligibility for asylum. The United States is a generous country but is being completely overwhelmed by the burdens associated with apprehending and processing hundreds of thousands of aliens along the southern border. This Rule will decrease forum shopping by economic migrants and those who seek to exploit our asylum system to obtain entry to the United States—while ensuring that no one is removed from the United States who is more likely than not to be tortured or persecuted on account of a protected ground.”

The United States has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of aliens encountered along or near the southern land border with Mexico. This increase corresponds with a sharp increase in the number, and percentage, of aliens claiming fear of persecution or torture when apprehended or encountered by DHS. The number of cases referred to DOJ for proceedings before an immigration judge has also risen exponentially, more than tripling between 2013 and 2018. These numbers are projected to continue to increase throughout the remainder of Fiscal Year 2019 and beyond.

Only a small minority of these individuals, however, are ultimately granted asylum. The large number of meritless asylum claims places an extraordinary strain on the nation’s immigration system, undermines many of the humanitarian purposes of asylum, has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis of human smuggling, and adversely impacts the United States’ ongoing diplomatic negotiations with foreign countries. This rule mitigates the strain on the country’s immigration system by more efficiently identifying aliens who are misusing the asylum system to enter and remain in the United States rather than legitimately seeking urgent protection from persecution or torture.

If a person from country A passes through country B before getting to the US, do they need to apply for asylum there even if it’s more dangerous than country A? If they pass through country B and C do they need to apply in both or just one of those countries?

The ACS is also where you get annual population estimates (the Census itself gives us our decennial population estimates). It asks about voting once a cycle. More methodology [here](http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/faq).

In 2016, about 59.2% of the voting-eligible population voted, roughly half for one candidate and half for the other. If the roughly 41.8% of eligible voters (eligibility varies by state, but many states restrict the rights of felons for example—this is factored into this estimate for the most part though I bet it overcounts in some areas, e.g. people suffering from dementia and other forms of cognitive decline) all voted for the same third party candidate, that candidate would have gotten more votes than either of the major party candidates. I don’t know if that candidate would win the electoral college or it would be a draw, but it’s probably fifteen minutes of work to figure out.

,"The question is two-fold:

1. Is @trump a public forum (without particular concern of explicit notice)? Twitter's platform is only relevant in that it has wide potential accessibility. So did Trump create a public forum where he both makes announcements in his governmental role and attracts public attention for interaction? Yes, he did.

    Limiting access to this forum is an equal access issue with regard to press, assembly and the exchange of information. Consider the useful (and longstanding) analogy to a [Marketplace of Ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace_of_ideas). If there is a (physical or otherwise) space under the purview of a government actor where people gather for the purpose of receiving information and debate, it must be equally accessible to all. The requirement moves with the government since the prohibition on rests with it, and not twitter (or any other venue). Twitter can ban whomever it wishes, except where the individual is acting in a governmental capacity (under equal time principles).

1. In the specific, can the government prohibit access to a public forum absent a legitimate compelling interest (narrowly construed)? The answer is, ""No."" This has been addressed recently in [Packingham v. North Carolina](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-1194). In that case, the petitioner defendant was a registered sex offender seeking access to a social media platform frequented by children. The court held that even a construct as narrow as that was not compelling enough to justify the prohibition. And in the case of @trump the ban was based on the government exercising prior restraint in the form of limited access.

> President Donald J. Trump appeals from a judgment of the United States 33 District Court for the Southern District of New York (Buchwald, J.) concluding that he engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by utilizing Twitter’s “blocking” function to limit certain users’ access to his social media account, which is otherwise open to the public at large, because he disagrees with their speech.  We hold that he engaged in such discrimination and, consequently, affirm the judgment below.

Note this refers only to an action of the President, not to any action of Twitter.  The question of whether Twitter can or cannot restrict speech based on viewpoints is not at issue here.  (Presumably Twitter would be in the same position here as a newspaper, which is uncontroversially allowed to have an editorial viewpoint and publish or not publish letters as it sees fit.)

The issue at hand here is whether the President can block people on social media because of their viewpoint.  The court finds (or, rather, upholds the previous finding) that preventing people from expressing themselves on Twitter, in a way they would otherwise have been able to do (which includes the fact that Twitter itself did *not* restrict the tweets), is a restriction on free speech and therefore not a constitutionally acceptable action by a President acting in his official capacity.",ghjm,,cbueec,etjbpk1

Privatization of everything is the dream of the anarchist. Less and less government rights and rules apply. 

Now, there is also a possibility of negative consequences of this ruling. If Trump cannot block critics, then does that mean twitter is considered a public forum for all and that free speech applies to all on Twitter?

""Acosta claimed that the U.S. Attorney’s Office worried it would have trouble proving federal charges against Epstein. With all respect to Acosta... that explanation is not credible. Federal prosecutors are famously reluctant to bring hard-to-prove cases, unlike district attorneys, who are generally eager to roll the dice. But no federal prosecutor would hesitate to pursue allegations of pervasive, organized child-sex abuse, backed by firsthand witnesses. It is more plausible that Epstein successfully wielded his nearly incomprehensible money and power to influence the decision at the highest levels.""

""... plead guilty to state charges, register as a sex offender, and spend 13 months in county jail, during which time he was allowed to spend 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, out of the jail on 'work release.' In exchange, the Southern District of Florida abandoned its criminal investigation of Epstein’s conduct, agreed not to prosecute him federally, and—incredibly—agreed not to prosecute anyone else who helped him procure underage girls for sex.

,"When the Miami Herald [revealed](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html) the bizarre details of Acosta's deal, both prosecutors and defense lawyers expressed shock and outrage. For example, here's [Ken White interviewed on All Things Considered](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/09/739999667/) (he also wrote [a piece for The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-indictment-hes-out-luck/593512/)), and [here is a conversation between Preet Bharara and Anne Milgram](https://www.cafe.com/cafe-insider-sample-07-08-listen-to-epstein-concensus/). 

They raise several points beyond the leniency of the sentence:

* Acosta personally negotiated the deal alone offsite, rather than let the group of prosecutors working the case do it at their government office or possibly escalate it to include him through the proper chain of command. Bharara and Milgram say they've never heard of anyone doing this, and for a non-politically-appointed prosecutor it would be a fireable offense.
* Acosta defended his actions by saying that Epstein's legal team had been personally attacking the prosecutors, which is not an unheard-of tactic for very rich defendants but it's very unusual for a prosecutor to use that as an excuse for the ""deal of the millennium"".
* The deal was kept secret from Epstein's accusers, which is contrary to standard practice at the Department of Justice and contrary to the Crime Victims' Rights Act.
* The deal ""conspicuously, and very oddly"" lacks a standard clause saying that it only binds the specific US Attorney's office that signed it (Southern District of Florida). However, the experts appear to expect it still won't give him immunity from the new charges in New York.
* The deal gave immunity not just to Epstein but also to his co-conspirators, including unnamed ones. There appears to be consensus that that is unprecedented: ""This is not normal; it's is astounding."" ""It's insane. It's bananas. I've never seen it, I've never done it, I can't imagine a reason to do it.""

He negotiated the plea deal. He has nearly 100% of the responsibility. I guess the judge could've rejected the deal, but in practice that doesn't happen.

The 2nd Amendment has become a popular wedge issue in American politics primarily [because](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-2) , unlike the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, it has a prefatory clause and an operative clause that other amendments do not use. This sets up modern Americans for an eternal debate over whether or not the prefatory clause limits the operative clause to define a natural right in a specific context, namely service in an official state militia, that is to say an exclusively “collective” right, or if the prefatory clause provides an explanation for the need of an individual right that can then be used for both individual and communal defense. This is a seemingly pedantic but indeed a very significant difference in opinion. 

Moreover, the important operative terms in the 2nd, such as “militia” and “well regulated,” are themselves products of the 18th century and can be easily misunderstood by the well-meaning, or intentionally and nefariously misconstrued by the politically motivated. [For example](https://www.constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm), the term “well regulated” at the time meant something in good working condition. To regulate something was not presumed to be the job of a government entity, as it often is assumed to be now.

 All that to say, the modern use of “militia” in American politics is, quite clearly, not the same as the use of “militia” in the modern use of American law. Just to reiterate, every male of American citizenship and military age is considered part of the unorganized militia in our country, legally speaking. 

However, self described “militias” made up of citizens, while technically part of The Militia, are not legally “militias.” Of course, Americans can call themselves just about whatever they want, thanks to the [1st Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) protecting their natural right to self expression, further confusing the situation. 

So, to answer your question directly, the nature of self-described “militia” in the United States can be literally anything, because they are citizens who are assembling, generally peaceably albeit [sometimes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge)  with motives that result in violence. “Militia” as these groups mean it is a useful term only in the sense that it co-opts part of the American legacy that is our Bill of Rights into their individual and communal identity. It has little meaning when it comes to the actual use of the term, because ALL male American citizens are in the militia. A similar phenomenon might be the use of the Gadsden Flag, which belongs to all Americans as part of their heritage but is often associated with the libertarian/pro-2A movement. 

So it gets even messier when trying to answer your second question. The Republican Party is simply a group of organized American citizens assembled for political reasons, same as the Democratic Party. Basically, The Militia makes up a significant portion of these political entities, while also having little to do with them in an official capacity ([until](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/453/57) , of course, our country faces a dire threat). 

However, self described “militias” are a whole different story. At this point, [it would seem](https://expo.oregonlive.com/news/g66l-2019/06/ff0f90f6211918/militia-offer-oregon-senators-security-republicans-arent-accepting-the-help.html) that there are few or no direct links between these self-styled militias and the Republican Party. However, this is not cause for a dismissive  attitude towards the increasing politicization of the 2nd Amendment and polarization of the country. Unfortunately, political parties in the US have taken “sides” so to speak when it comes to interpreting the 2nd Amendment, and [both](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20181109/midterm-elections-offer-motivation-to-continue-the-fight-for-our-rights)  [frequently](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2019/7/1/18683860/democrats-2020-gun-control-mass-shootings)  use it as a political wedge issue to motivate voters to the polls. 

This means that “pro-2A” political parties such as the Republicans will garner more support from pro-2A “militias.” Though there are [examples ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party) counter to this, highlighting the fact that 2A rights are for everyone, the wedge issue has become a badge of political pride or disgrace, and thus a significant cultural moniker in our current climate. 

Which, to answer your question, means that even though we don’t see a direct link between “militias” and the Republican Party now, we have clearly set the stage for one to be created through the development of a cultural wedge issue based on a legal debate about the Second Amendment.

Also at my link is the Oregon legislative lawyer has opined that the police have the power to compel legislator attendance. The issue here is separation of powers - the Sergeant at Arms of the Oregon Legislature is the person allowed to physically compel the legislators to the legislative venue - using the police against the legislators is why the militia is present. 

It seems the Democrats are claiming that using the police is settled law but it really isn’t - because only the superintendent of police can authorize physical touching of the legislators. Now here is where this gets really interesting. 

To reframe the militia response: Republicans alleging their militia should be viewed as private security, like Pinkerton or Blackwater. Democrats alleging the police should be viewed as an extension of the legislative sergeant at arms. Democrats are muddying the waters between separation of powers; Republicans are muddying the waters between government and citizen.

,"First I’d like to speak to your assertion that conditions are very poor in US detention centers as a whole. [The linked snopes article you provided shows photographs and information from a time period between 2014 and 2015. These holding cells were being abused at the time leading to people being held there for more time than they should have been, up to 3 days in some situations](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/19/490624225/surveillance-stills-from-border-patrol-facilities-show-crowded-trash-filled-cell). There is typically a multi-step process that spans over the course of a few days. [They first go to the initial holding cells, then get transferred to processing centers, then it is decided if they will be moved to the main detention centers](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2018/09/17/a-look-inside-the-child-detention-centers-near-the-u-s-border/). While conditions may vary, and I think that most agree, those conditions need to be improved in this process, it’s usually “very poor conditions” only within the first few days. IE. Cages, lack of beds, understaffed health workers. However, at no point are the conditions so drastically poor that they lead to an influx of mortality rates. [In fact a total of 12 people died in the fiscal year 2016, while in custody at ICE detention centers](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/reports/detaineedeaths-2003-2017.pdf). Many of whom had health issues prior to becoming a detainee, and died as a result of those conditions.
The [page of advice you cited](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/living-conditions-immigration-detention-centers.html), shouldn’t come as a shock to anyone, that these main detention centers appear to be like jails. They are in fact called “detention centers” for a reason. Now whether or not genuine asylum seekers should be bundled in with a population of blatant illegal border crossing individuals, or other far worse criminals detained by ICE, is debatable. It’s my personal opinion that they should not. Which leads to the ultimate conclusion that there is a lot of room for improvements in the process as a whole. [However, according to ICE 2017 Fiscal year statistics, 92% of all aliens arrested by ICE that year had criminal convictions, pending criminal charges, were an immigration fugitive, or were an illegal re-entrant.](https://www.ice.gov/topics/fy2017)

Now to address your questions.

>1. Are these holding facilities just for people whose immigration is being processed?

Holding facilities yes, as I described it above, they are for people who have entered the country, were detained by ICE, and are awaiting processing. They are then moved to detention centers where they await whether or not they are to be deported, or to be granted asylum. [This exchange of questions and answers](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/25/623318881/what-rights-are-afforded-to-people-who-cross-the-u-s-border-illegally) should highlight the different circumstances you may be on the fence about. Prior to being detained a person can choose to voluntarily be returned, or an immigration inspector can decide whether or not to remove them in an expedited fashion.  

>2. Would people in these centers be free to return home if they chose to give up on trying to enter the US?

I answered this question above, the answer is yes if they aren’t already detained, however once they begin the process they’re in the process, and it can take time to exit the process. [Bonds, etc may be set and required prior to exit. In a lot of cases it might be best to wait it out and see a judge, as the person detained will see a judge much quicker while detained](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/immigration-detention-101-information-detainees-family-friends.html). 


>3. What is preventing us from improving our throughput for processing immigrants to keep up with demand?

Budget and resources will always remain a problem, [but there are some issues that arise due to some counties of origin not allowing the return of deported people as well as lack of documentation for the person being deported](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/how-long-will-it-take-detained-person-be-deported).

The administration is actively making it harder to process immigrants and asylum requests. They are preventing legal requests of Asylum at ports of entry. They are going to start denying translators for hearings so they can't ask any questions. 

As for actually improving? We could go back to the previous system which had a 99% attendance rate of asylum hearings for claimants and didn't require detention for all family or mandated separation of children. It was a program with 70k families and Trump admin ended it.

There are four key guidelines:

- Population. Each district must be as close as possible to having the same population as the other districts, while still respecting the other guidelines. Additionally, each district should have an equal or nearly equal mix of rural and urban populations.

- Congruity. Each district must be composed of convenient congruous territory. So you can't have districts that are split apart.

- Compactness. Each district has to be a square, rectangular, or hexagonal shape. No squiggly weird boundaries.

- Respect for political subdivisions. The district lines must follow state political boundary lines, so counties cannot be split in half by a district line unless absolutely necessary.

Additionally, Iowa code goes one step further and establishes what factors CANNOT be considered when drawing the maps. In fact, drawing district lines to favor an incumbent is explicitly forbidden.

The actual redistricting commission is truly bipartisan. There are 5 members; two are chosen by the majority party and two by the minority party, the fifth member and the chairman are chosen by a majority vote of the other four.

[Politics1](http://politics1.com) - A bare bones website from 1997 that lists all the candidate's personal websites for every office you can think of, basically. It has all of the current presidential contenders there as well. The guy who runs it is independent, I believe. He has worked on a bunch of campaigns and currently works for Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland. This is useful if you want a repository of all the candidate's websites. A lot of times, the best way to learn about a candidate is to hear it from themselves. Go to Bernie's website, or Trump's, or Weld's, and read what they are talking about there. It's real easy to get caught up in what others are saying about the person. And that has some use too. But their website will give you a good idea of what they are about. 

[On the issues](http://ontheissues.org/2020_Dems.htm) is another good one. Created in 1999, it is a repository of candidate statements about various issues. It also does basic analysis of each candidate, and just sort of reports what they said about an issue. Most of the candidate pages have a graph at the bottom. On the issues assigns each response a point value (not based on correct or incorrect, just for graphing purposes) and uses those points to align the dot on the graph. The graph at the bottom is divided into different ideologies, so you can kind of get an idea of what camp each person is in.

,"I can make an argument both for and against its constitutionality.  

Currently, we do something like this with lower courts, where district judges [can sometimes hear cases](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/292) as appeals court judges.  

The article linked in the OP is scant, but I assume Sanders would be proposing something like a number of circuit appeals court judges sitting on the Supreme Court by designation for limited periods of time.

So the court would then be composed of say:

* 9 permanent Supreme Court justices; and

* 6 appeals court judges sitting temporarily by designation.

When [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/inside-pete-buttigieg-s-plan-overhaul-supreme-court-n1012491) proposed something similar, he indicated that the judges sitting by designation would be chosen unanimously by the permanent justices.

As to whether or not it is constitutional, I think the key issue will be Article II section 2.  That says in relevant part:

>[The President] shall
nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint
Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, **Judges of the supreme Court,**
and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein
otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress
may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think
proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of
Departments.

The question here is whether because the Constitution specifies judges of the Supreme Court as a distinct constitutional office from other federal judges, or whether Congress' power to establish Officers of the United States allows them to establish that judicial officers in other courts may serve on the Supreme Court by designation.  

I think the strongest point in favor of it being constitutional is that it was historically done in the other direction since shortly after the founding.  In the [initial Judiciary Act](https://www.fjc.gov/history/timeline/circuit-riding) Congress established that the Supreme Court justices would go around the country and sit on lower appeals courts in a practice known as ""riding circuit.""

On the other hand, there's an argument that this could only go one way and not the other, and that since the Constitution establishes ""judges of the Supreme court"" as a distinct job, only people appointed to that distinct job may hold that role.",huadpe,,c6lo4d,eshp3oi

The courts are established in [Article 3, Section 1 of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii).

The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.

This has generally been accepted that appointment is lifetime, but judges are free to retire/resign at any time. The ""good behaviour"" statement has generally been accepted that judges can be impeached, which [Congress has done on multiple occasions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States#Federal_officials_impeached) though not always to the effect of removal.

It should be noted that the Constitution doesn't set parameters for the size, structure, and functionality of the Supreme Court though. The only position that was expressly created by the Constitution was Chief Justice. It was the [Judiciary Act of 1789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789) that originally set the size of the Supreme Court and established the structure of all Federal courts. Many subsequent Acts have been passed to change the size of the Supreme Court, but the current size of 9 is due to the [Judiciary Act of 1869](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1869).

I guess this is all a roundabout way of saying, this really doesn't have much to do with the Constitution as the size and structure of the Supreme Court is dictated by laws passed by Congress (e.g. the President has no say in the matter). However, should a lower federal court become open, there's nothing stopping the president from appointing a sitting Supreme Court Justice to it. They'd need to accept the appointment and be confirmed by congress though.",tklite,,c6lo4d,etg0ywc
,"[In April, 2018](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/16/qa-trump-administrations-zero-tolerance-immigration-policy) Attorney General Jeff Sessions enacted a zero tolerance policy for prosecuting those crossing the border illegally. 

> Although these offenses [illegal entry and illegal re-entry] have been federal crimes for many years, for most of that time, the US government usually prosecuted people only if they had serious prior criminal convictions and had reentered after being deported, or if they were “repeat offenders” – people who had reentered repeatedly after deportation.


So, essentially, the zero tolerance memorandum issued by Sessions/Trump was cracking down on prosecuting people for crimes that we had let slip under the radar in the past (literally just crossing the border without permission, even if they didn’t have any other priors). However, we’ve also had other “zero tolerance” policies in the past that have aimed to crack down on prosecuting illegal immigration, so what makes this executive order different? 

First, [it put new restrictions on asylum seekers, leading to the prosecution and detainment of such individuals](https://www.aila.org/File/DownloadEmbeddedFile/76742). 
*With this, it’s important to note that those who are seeking asylum have the international right to do so, and that its legal for them to apply for asylum within 1 year of entering the country, even if they don’t arrive through a legal port of entry.* 
Source: https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/asylum-united-states 


Second, [the memorandum from the attorney generals office seemed to place a high importance on detaining families that had crossed the border](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1049751/download), essentially saying that those who violate 8 U.S. Code § 1324 should be placed at the “highest” priority. (I might be incorrect here, but 8 U.S. Code § 1324 seems like it could *easily* be applied to families crossing the border). 


So, now, we’re prosecuting and detaining more people than we ever have at the border and we haven’t increased funding towards the facilities that hold them, nor have we increased funding/staffing towards the process of getting said individuals to their initial judicial hearing, which has created a huge backlog of individuals being detained. **This** is why conditions are so horrifying. 



It is also why, this week, after the striking reports of the conditions at the border, [the House and Senate introduced their own bills to send emergency aid to said facilities](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/politics/house-senate-border-spending-bills.html?module=inline&utm_source=hive&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=hive_email_id_33755&h_sid=faa0d2f81e-5d0e7c4950d473b7b04d86ba) (I would also highly suggest reading this entire article— it outlines the differences between the two bills). The senate bill passed over the house bill, and (completely personal opinion/political observation from here) I think it’s very likely that the only reason that happened is because the democrats in the house recognize the severity of the conditions at the border and knew that McConnell would stonewall their version of the bill for emergency aid.

,"Though I personally do not disagree with zero tolerance policy since I believe laws are laws. I think a big problem is that a “zero tolerance” policy was put in place before the infrastructure was developed to actively support a zero tolerance policy.

It’s hard to believe that these centers were created for the census that is actively being apprehended. Which is a bad thing for everyone involved.

With the threat of a wall coming, it makes sense for illegal immigration to spike as it may seem easier to cross now than in the future.

Was this part of the now—for President Trump, at least, the notorious Flores decision? Could you talk about how you got in? And also, who are the personnel here? Are these government employees, or are these private contractors working for the government at this facility?*

>*CLARA LONG: Yeah. So, the way that we got in is through this now-notorious-for-President-Trump Flores settlement agreement, which gives access to the attorneys for the plaintiffs, who are all children detained by immigration enforcement, by Customs and Border Protection. You know, back in a day, it was INS, so it’s all of the agencies that took over from INS, including, of course, also Health and Human Services, which runs the big Office of Refugee Resettlement detention centers and shelters for children.*

>*So, Flores counsel has access to all of these—to speak with children who are detained in all of these facilities. Where the facilities are licensed for child care—this is sort of counterintuitive—the Flores counsel has access to inspect the facility as a whole. Where it’s not licensed for child care, as in the case of the Border Patrol stations, Flores counsel does not have access to inspect the facility as a whole, but we can speak with the children who are detained there.*

>*Outside of this settlement, there are really very few, if not no, ways for outsiders, attorneys, inspectors, others to enter into these Border Patrol stations, where we did these visits last week, and another team the week before, in Texas. And, you know, they’re closed to attorneys. They’re closed to visitors. They’re just very, very closed facilities.

Here is the HRW report:  Code Red - The Fatal Consequences of Dangerously Substandard Medical Care in Immigration Detention.  (2018) this report has detailed observations of facilities, with guard and prisoner interactions time and date stamped.  They conduct case studies of 15 deaths which occurred November 2017-March 2018.  Their methodology is discussed in detail, as well as the larger historical background of immigrant detention by ICE.  This report contains recommendations for local, state and federal governments to reduce the number of deaths in detention.

The case studies were reviewed by ""at least two independent physicians with expertise in correctional health who separately reviewed the reports and shared their conclusions"". 

Here are the recommendations for ICE specifically:

1. Take immediate steps to reduce detention and utilize alternatives such as community-based supervision programs and parole.

2. Refrain from detaining individuals with serious medical and mental health needs.
    
3. Ban the use of prolonged or indefinite isolation in immigration detention (whether for administrative or disciplinary reasons) and prohibit without exception the use of isolation for vulnerable populations including those with psychosocial disabilities.

4. Provide reasonable accommodations and respond appropriately to the support needs of detained people with disabilities. Ensure detained people with a disability have adequate access to support and mental health services.
 
5. Ensure all detention facilities have appropriate clinical staffing plans and publicly disclose whether positions are filled as a compliance component during ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Office of Detention Oversight (ODO) inspections.

6. Address issues with quality control of practitioner care and with medical staff practicing beyond the scope of their licenses.

7. Reform the monitoring system to task a single fully independent entity with responsibility and authority for reviewing and approving corrective action plans, monitoring compliance with applicable standards, and imposing sanctions for non-compliance, including closure of detention centers.

8. Require that detainee death review investigations include subject matter experts with sufficient expertise to evaluate clinical decisions and conduct a full mortality review focused not solely on technical compliance with standards but the factors contributing to poor care.

9. As required by Congress in the Explanatory Statement accompanying the Fiscal Year 2018 spending bill passed in March 2018, make ERO inspections, ODO inspections, and Detainee Death Reviews (including those conducted by ODO, DHS Office of the Inspector General, and DHS Civil Rights and Civil Liberties) available to the public within 60 days of the inspection or, in the case of death reviews, within 30 days of the death. Provide regular public and congressional reporting on the frequency and circumstances of unanticipated events resulting in death or serious physical or psychological injury to a patient or patients in detention (also known as sentinel events).

,"What I’m curious about is whether Texas’ reduction in homeless is actually conversion of homeless to homed, or homeless leaving the state for places with more homeless services (e.g., Portland, Seattle, SF). 

At least in Seattle, which has a similar strategy for homeless as California, the increase in homeless spending has had no impact on reducing homelessness. Homelessness has actually grown with spending over the years. Whether they’re driving each other’s growth is a very interesting question. Source (though a bit biased): https://www.city-journal.org/seattle-homelessness

If Texas (and other states that have reduced homelessness) actually have converted homeless people to homed/employed, and not driven them to flee elsewhere, then it would make sense that they are the models to follow. But if their policies are just driving the homeless elsewhere, then we have an even harder problem that no one seems to have a working solution to. 

Housing first seems to be the answer, but in liberal west-coast cities, there is heated debate whether that housing should actually be in the city.

,"Quorum abuse tends to show up in deeply divisive issues.  Either a group will coordinate secretly to form a quorum just large enough to quickly meet and make changes, or a group will conspire to avoid a meeting to prevent a quorum from occurring.

In 2011, [Wisconsin Democrats fled the state and went to Illinois](https://www.npr.org/2011/02/17/133847336/wis-democratic-lawmakers-flee-to-prevent-vote) to try and prevent Republicans there from scaling back unions in state government jobs.  

I know recently in my home state of Utah, the state Republican body was fiercely split on a primaries issue, and so occasionally a few like-minded members would suddenly gather in an inconvenient time, meet the rules of a quorum, and pass new resolutions.  In one such meeting, some opposed to the new resolutions realized they could destroy the quorum numbers by leaving, and tried to do so, and the committee responded by locking the meeting room doors and forced them inside. 

Quorum abuse isn't new.  Oregon's Republican representatives will be fined, but that's it.  State police can only return them if found in Oregon.  Neighboring states and the federal government can't use their resources to force them back.

As for political fallout, their constituents probably are proud of their Republican representatives preventing new taxes, and they likely won't get voted out.  Another option is to change quorum rules, but that would require the current set of legislatures agree to that, which is unlikely to occur.",helix400,,c4gs5j,erx1wj7

3.  Militia groups did offer to support senators in their flight. (https://twitter.com/annavtoriasmith/status/1141846696684474368)

4.  The Oregon State Police believed there was credible threat of violence during planned protests at the capital this last Saturday.  The police have (correctly) declined to offer details on the threats, leaving room for speculation.  This has led the press to link the Oregon 3% group to the threats, and led the state GOP twitter to mock the validity of the threads 🤦‍♂️

5.  The state spokesman for the republican party has condemned any militia threats of violence.  Additionally, while militia offered to help senators fleeing the same spokesman said he does not think there's any validity to claims that they've actually participated in the senators' flight.

,"Basically, it's a complicated political question about so-called ""sanctuary cities/states,"" rather than a simple ""law and order"" question.  

For some background, here's a pretty good breakdown of what sanctuary cities (which has no legal meaning) are: [Vox article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/8/17091984/sanctuary-cities-city-state-illegal-immigration-sessions)

[And Wikipedia, which gives some nice background, as well as maps and a state-by-state breakdown of laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city#United_States)

To summarize the above, due to political disagreements over the direction US immigration policy -- disagreements which have been pushed to the forefront by the Trump Administration -- some cities and states have declared that they will not cooperate with ICE on immigration enforcement.  The do so to send the message that their city/state is a relative safe haven for immigrants, even if the US at large is not.  

Which brings us to the current question, which isn't exactly about sanctuary cities, but kindof is.  Massive ICE raids like the ones planned, which have been stated to involve sanctuary cities/states, threaten those cities/states' statement to immigrants that they are a safe haven.  So they resist in any way that they can.  

So it's a complex political question, tied up with federal vs state vs city political rights/power, tied up with the ethics of separating families in the process of enforcing immigration law.",towishimp,,c3vqda,eruodn4
,"I think part of what makes mass deportation ineffective as an enforcement mechanism is that many of the people getting deported have already been in the US for a number of years. [Source](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/508/) According to one study, the average undocumented immigrant living in the US in 2016 had been in the country for 15 years.

Quick deportations at the border are one thing, but when you're talking about established residents (who haven't committed ""[crimes involving moral turpitude](https://patrickgriffinlaw.com/crime-moral-turpitude/)""),  then the deportation process itself can take a long time (sometimes years), and is actually quite expensive and logistically challenging.

[Source](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics)

Currently, it's estimated that there are more than 10 million undocumented immigrants currently living and working in the US (referenced in many of the linked sources). The underlying issue is - why are so many undocumented immigrants here in the first place?

Ironically, there is significant evidence that tightening the borders has actually caused more migrants to settle down in the US and form lives here, compared to earlier decades when people used to come and go for seasonal work (and typically have their families in Mexico).

The fact is, there is demand for low-skilled immigrant labor in the US. [Source](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/18/18270916/labor-shortage-workers-us) And a lot of people are willing to deal with the risks of coming to the US to flee conditions in their home countries - the possibility of being deported 10 years after arrival (if you make it across) probably won't be enough to deter them.

When Watson was due to be released from state custody, he was picked up by ICE and taken to a detention center. He was held for 1,273 days, continuously asserting that he was a U.S. citizen and fighting his case pro se because he was not entitled to an attorney and could not afford one.

* **Crime:** All studies that specifically look at sanctuary policies and crime have found that sanctuary policies have essentially no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1078087417704974), [2](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418825.2017.1400577), [3](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fsoc4.12547), [4](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/)), and that immigration enforcement has no impact on the crime rate ([1](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/680935), [2](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151041), [3](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/52/1/Symposium/52-1_Hines_Peri.pdf)). This is broadly consistent with the academic literature on the relationship between [illegal immigration and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Crime_and_law_enforcement), and [immigration (legal and illegal) and crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime).

A [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.12.004) in one of the top economics journals found that strict immigration enforcement substantially increases the likelihood that US-born children with undocumented immigrant parents will live in poverty. Research does not indicate that immigration enforcement is good fiscal policy; on the contrary,it's more likely to be a net cost for tax-payers ([1](http://econofact.org/do-immigrants-cost-native-born-taxpayers-money), [2](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41645), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699990), [4](https://ssrn.com/abstract=881584), [5](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration)). 
* **Health:** There are as far as I know no studies on the health impact of sanctuary policies, but studies of DACA have shown that DACA-eligible individuals and their families have substantially better health outcomes when they don't live under imminent threat of being deported ([1](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6355/1041), [2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2468266717300476), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361730148X?via%3Dihub)).

So, in short, making life difficult for undocumented immigrants does not just impose horrendous harms on the migrants (and what is in many cases their US-born children), but is bad for everyone.

One obvious solution is to shift potential illegal immigrants into legal ones by implementing functional guest worker programs.

See [http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/steel-and-aluminum-tariffs](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/steel-and-aluminum-tariffs). Zero professional economists, who have a range of political leanings, believe the previously imposed tariffs will improve overall welfare.

The conservative think tank Tax Foundation has an analysis of the impact of US Tariffs here: [https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trade/](https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trade/). To summarize, they find a net decrease to American welfare. They have not yet analyzed the projected impact of the newly-threatened tariffs. While it is difficult to source the non-existence of something, I have yet to see a single serious apolitical economic analysis that finds any of Trump's tariffs to be beneficial to the country.

If I may add a bit of editorial: The topic of tariffs is often hard to find a ""two sided"" economic argument around, because it's essentially a settled, known, well-understood problem among in economics. Viewing it as a political rather than economic measure might shed more light.",MeweldeMoore,,c38mq5,erqdmoe
,"Basic economics tells us that ceteris paribus (all things being equal) tariffs are a net negative for everyone. So if the other side retaliates in the same manner they aren't good at all. Without tariffs each country focuses on producing what it can produce using less resources, then they trade and everyone is better off.

&nbsp;


In any case - China imports a lot less from the US ([difference here](https://ibankcoin.com/flyblog/files/2018/03/b9d81b0e-8ad0-40ff-9be8-71671085c0c1.jpg)) than the other way around meaning the US has more leverage when it comes to tariffs so push come to shove CH cannot retaliate as hard in tariffs - and probably neither can Mexico

So in the case a tariff is not retaliated against it acts as a tax. On which country the cost of that tax ultimately falls down to depends on the nature of the good itself (Is it easily substituted? Produced locally? Brought in from another country? etc.) - meaning it is possible that through tariffs and regulations on trade you can prop up your own economy by artificially depressing those of your trade partners (by putting tariffs on goods where cost mostly falls of industries of other countries instead of local taxation).

Propping up your economy in that way is called mercantilism - many economists think that China is practicing a version of it (Here's Chris Chapel on China uncensored [making a case for tariffs](https://youtu.be/KBDoCTgVpk4) - he cites [this report](http://www2.itif.org/2015-false-promises-china.pdf) to argue that indeed China cheats in trade) but this is not at all settled. In any case, mercantilism is ugly, it tends to kickstart wars, which is why the WTO was formed in the first place.

&nbsp;

So if, the forementioned countries were practicing mercantilism, and if those tariffs got them to stop it would undoubtedly benefit the US.

If those countries practiced mercantilism but didn't stop, tariffs are still the right idea and **might** bring the US long term growth (compared to raising the same amount of money with other taxes / issuing debt) and greater trade independence, but what they will primarily achieve is shrinking the economies that the US trades with and increase political tensions.

If the countries are fair in their trade practices it's a lose-lose.

We can see the effects of the trade war already, over a month ago there was an infographic posted to /r/europe ([who really wins in a trade war](https://i.redd.it/8x36h4lr60y21.jpg)) - and I put the numbers as % of GDP in my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/bo5ic3/who_benefits_form_the_uschina_trade_war/endaio1/) - both in nominal terms and % decrease in GDP tariffs are hurting CHN a lot more than US right now, but it's not projected for US to increase their GDP with them (again, remember you would have to compare % decrease in GDP of tariffs to the same amount raised in taxes - every tax decreases growth)

,"The only real regulation required is to separate ""service animals"" from everyday pets.

People are registering their pets as service animals to get them into places that pets are otherwise not allowed.
https://www.caninejournal.com/emotional-support-animal-registration/

Mainly this means the reworking or removal of the ""emotional support animal"" category, which is easy to get into, requires no training or supervision, and is ripe for corruption due to lack of oversight.  Legally, emotional support is grouped with trained service animals, which makes discrimination on them illegal, but they should be completely separate, with separate legal treatment or perhaps no protection for ESAs from discrimination.

If people desperately need an animal to help them manage panic attacks, for example, those are trained service dogs, not ESAs, who do that.

Beyond closing the ESA loophole, it seems no regulation is required.  The actual service animal industry, with actual service animals, seems to function just fine and if anything -as you say- could be made cheaper.",Synaps4,,c2kk0d,erl4i7f
,"We need to distinguish between a service animal and an emotional support animal. 

A service animal is regulated by the [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm)  and must be a dog trained to work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability. These are important animals and need to be allowed everywhere as their owner’s life may literally depend on it. Period.

On the other hand, an emotional support animal, AKA therapy dogs, is unregulated and, while they can also play an important role for people with emotional regulation problems, they do not NEED to go wherever their owner goes. We have all seen the articles (cited in the original post) about ridiculous animals being claimed as therapy animals, and their owners making ridiculous demands for their emotional support animal. These types of animals need to be regulated with a formal registry and businesses that do not want these types of animals (think hotels, airlines, food establishments) should not be shamed or threatened for not allowing these animals. No one HAS to stay at a not otherwise pet friendly hotel, no one HAS to fly with unlimited access to their animal during flight (not saying an animal can’t help someone with anxiety, but no one HAS to fly at all), and no one HAS to eat at a certain establishment.

All that is to say I am sick of people trying to pass off emotional support animals as ADA trained service animals.",mklcsw,,c2kk0d,erl5xkl

However I do not understand at all why there is no onus on the dog owner to prove that their dog is indeed a service animal. That should absolutely be required if requested. And the law should be changed to allow businesses/etc. to request this information if they choose to. Many businesses do not want dogs inside because it can drive away other customers, especially if that customer has a fear of dogs or even an allergy to dogs.",48151_62342,,c2kk0d,erle84c
,"I don't see much conversation here about how misbehaving service animals are allowed to be ejected from a venue. In my opinion, this is a very solid argument in favor of not needing any certification process for service animals. Whether or not you can afford to hire professional service animal training, if your animal misbehaves, it may be asked to leave. Similarly if you lie and claim that your animal is a service animal and it misbehaves, it may be asked to leave. In other words, we punish the misbehaviors themselves rather than the group of people we prejudicially believe (whether accurately or not) is more likely to cause problems.

* A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal’s presence.

In addition, venue owners are allowed to recover damages from guests whether or not they have service animals, further making sure to appropriately protect the venue owners while treating fairly people with service animals.

* If a business such as a hotel normally charges guests for damage that they cause, a customer with a disability may also be charged for damage caused by himself or his service animal.

,"Seems to be some confusion over what can be a support animal. ADA says ONLY dogs. 
>Q1. What is a service animal?

>A. Under the ADA, a service animal is defined as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability.  The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person's disability.  
  
https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html",loli_esports,,c2kk0d,erlto2k
,"Before I can address the arguments against service animal registration I need to point out your misunderstandings of what the federal laws are currently.  

First the ADA and commercial air travel.  Everything you said about air travel in relation to the ADA and ADA definition does not apply.  https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html

>Q37. Do commercial airlines have to comply with the ADA?

>A. No.  The Air Carrier Access Act is the Federal law that protects the rights of people with disabilities in air travel.  For information or to file a complaint, contact the U.S. Department of Transportation, Aviation Consumer Protection Division, at 202-366-2220.

So the next question would be what does the ACAA say about service animals in commercial air travel.  Under the DoT guidance 
https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/P3.SA_.HUD%20Matrix.6-28-6.pdf
 service animals are

>Any animal that is individually trained or able to provide assistance to a qualified person with a disability; or any animal shown by documentation to be necessary for the emotional well-being of a passenger.

Your statement that ESAs are not required to be trained is also incorrect.  As the DoT document shows

>All service animals must be trained to behave appropriately in a public setting.

Also there is specific documentation from a treating licensed medical/mental health professional that airlines can require for anyone traveling with a psychiatric service animal, whether it is task trained or an ESA, 48 hours in advance.

As for housing again the ADA is not the law that applies as the ADA only applies to very specific housing situations and does not cover ESAs.  Almost all housing is covered by the HUD regulations implementing the Fair Housing Act and/or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Again from the ADA Q and A sheet

>Q35. Do apartments, mobile home parks, and other residential properties have to comply with the ADA?

>A. The ADA applies to housing programs administered by state and local governments, such as public housing authorities, and by places of public accommodation, such as public and private universities.  In addition, the Fair Housing Act applies to virtually all types of housing, both public and privately-owned, including housing covered by the ADA.  Under the Fair Housing Act, housing providers are obligated to permit, as a reasonable accommodation, the use of animals that work, provide assistance, or perform tasks that benefit persons with a disabilities, or provide emotional support to alleviate a symptom or effect of a disability.  For information about these Fair Housing Act requirements see HUD’s Notice on Service Animals and Assistance Animals for People with Disabilities in Housing and HUD-funded Programs.

==

Now as for opposition to a service animal registration the biggest argument against it is that requiring it would be doing exactly the kind of thing the ADA was put in place to prevent.  Requiring a person with a disability to obtain carry and provide documentation in order to be allowed in a business, something no one else has to do is the very essence of discrimination.  The US Department of Justice has given this reason as to why it is opposed to any such documentation requirement in the Section-by-Section Analysis and Guidance portion of the federal regulations.  https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleIII_2010/titleIII_2010_regulations.htm

>The proposal would also require persons with disabilities to obtain medical documentation and carry it with them any time they seek to engage in ordinary activities of daily life in their communities— something individuals without disabilities have not been required to do. Accordingly, the Department has concluded that a documentation requirement of this kind would be unnecessary, burdensome, and contrary to the spirit, intent, and mandates of the ADA.

We do not have to look back too far in history to see what happens when those with disabilities are viewed as less than equal.  Everything the Nazis did to Jews was first tried on the disabled.   [The Nazis’ First Victims Were the Disabled](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/opinion/nazis-holocaust-disabled.html)  They set a pattern by which a modern state can repress segments of its population using bureaucratic paperwork.  [Registering the Handicapped in Nazi Germany: A Case Study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20101303?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)

>In this paper, the process applied to the handicapped serves as an example to show the repressive efficacy provided by bureaucratic paperwork in the modern state. It shows how agencies of state and party collected, evaluated, and processed the data necessary to exclude and finally kill a proscribed population.

For those that would say well that's Nazi Germany that could not happen here, the Nazis were inspired by and took example from the eugenics programs of the US.  [Unwanted Sterilization and Eugenics Programs in the United States](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unwanted-sterilization-and-eugenics-programs-in-the-united-states/)  Also let us not forget that the disabled were forcibly and without their knowledge sterilized through the 1970's thanks in part to Supreme Court ruling on Buck v. Bell 

>This Supreme Court case led to the sterilization of 65,000 Americans with mental illness or developmental disabilities from the 1920s to the ’70s. (Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in reference to Carrie: “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”) The court ruling still stands today.

My mother is blind and is a recipient of this service. 


Although the recent abuse of the lack of regulations does raise this discussion, being blind is difficult in ways not everyone realizes. Aside from the obvious challenges, one of the most difficult aspects of being blind in public is that people do not know you are blind. Not every blind person chooses to wear huge blacked out glasses, and not all blind people need or want to carry a cane. There are ways to convey themselves without wearing stereotypical ""I am Blind"" signs on their person. One of these ways is to be guided by their dog. But every additional step in a process at places like airports can mean severely delaying that person. My blind mother has missed many flights because TSA personnel held her up with the existing regulations that sighted people negotiate without as much difficulty. 


If she, or people like her, also had to be ready to provide proof or licensing or additional documentation (that they themselves cannot read and verify), it would add aggregious amounts of difficulty to an already challenging life. 


The fact is, a largely unregulated system has worked for over 75 years in the case linked earlier.

,"Here is my two cents as most people on here clearly have never had an ESA or service animal:

Documentation should be carried by someone with an ESA or service animal at all times. Business should be permitted to ask to see the documentation and that's all they should have to ask for, and that animal should be allowed in as long as it does not cause disruptions to the business (barking, peeing on the floor, etc). If it does cause disruptions, the owner has the right to kick it out. 

ESAs are not a joke to those who need them, and even though they are being abused (like Food Stamps), the people they help out weigh the abusers. My wife has an ESA and she NEEDS it. Everywhere. But she can't take it many places service animals can go. It still provides a service, which is just to keep her calm, but not as in-depth as seeing eye dogs and other animals.

What I believe needs to happen is this - ESAs and service animals need to be put into the same category and they all need to be easier to obtain meaning: a doctor has to sign off on your disability and a veterinarian has to sign off on your pets capabilities. That's it. No thousands of dollars of fees and licensing. Something that two independent parties have to sign off on and put their own reputation and licenses on the line for. 

Mini rant: It's just an animal for Christ's sake. Children are more disruptive and destructive than 90% of the animals that I've seen in businesses, and we can't ask the children to be kicked out. As long as someone's pet is mild mannered, I don't and haven't (I've worked 10 years of food service and customer service) asked anyone about their pet.

1. Yes, absolutely. For a small sampler see the career of [Don King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_King_\(boxing_promoter\)).

2. Yes. The combination of more financial transparency and more contract mobility for fighters has given them more leverage in negotiating for a cut.

3. Yes. You can see the distinct uptick in individuals holding belts from multiple organizations [starting in the 2000's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heavyweight_boxing_champions) from making it easier to compete in multiple promotions. It's also anecdotally made it easier to get into small boxing circuits.

4. I would say it varies, but in general the contract stuff has worked well simply because it makes remedies available through the courts and fighters aren't afraid to sue.

5. Providing legal remedies and minimal regulatory oversight can help protect athletes in sports without central governing bodies.

6. Yes. UFC fight contracts typically include several provisions that would be removed under this law, such as contracts [lasting multiple years and a mandatory extension from the ""champion's clause""](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1516575-the-business-of-fighting-a-look-inside-the-ufcs-top-secret-fighter-contract#slide4).

7. We probably won't see anyone do a seven or eight fight title defense for a long time if it passes. That's because champions will be shopping themselves around for the biggest bucks once they legally can.

8. The fighters will make more money and have more ability to change fight promotions. This is all good in my book.

2.The state officials are not ensuring the protection of the boxers and are not aware or informed of contracts boxers have agreed to.

3.Promoters are taking advantage of the sport by conducting dishonest business affairs. Promoters are not being punished due to some states being less strict about the legal terms that are stated in contracts.

5.There has been a major interference in the sport because of open competition by restrictive and anti-competitive bodies.

6.There are no restrictions placed on contracts that boxers agree to with promoters and managers. It is necessary to enforce a national contract reform which will guarantee the safety of professional boxers and the public from unlawful contracts and to enhance the integrity of the sport.""


I will try to relate these to MMA number by number.

1. Unlike boxing, MMA *is* governed by major leagues/associations just like other sports. The most prominent one being the [Ultimate Fighting Championship](https://www.ufc.com/). So this need is met by MMA. 

2. MMA matches are regulated by the exact same state regulating bodies that handle boxing matches.  Most of the major commissions. For instance, the fights in Las Vegas (most major events) are handled by[The Nevada State Athletic Commission. ](http://boxing.nv.gov/)

3. In MMA the promoter and the league/association (such as the UFC) are one and the same.  Whether the UFC is being dishonest is up for debate.  There is currently an [Antitrust lawsuit ](https://www-forbes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.forbes.com/sites/paulgift/2018/09/24/ufc-antitrust-lawsuit-plaintiffs-oppose-summary-judgment-pitch-trial-mma-news/amp/?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQDoAEC#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fpaulgift%2F2018%2F09%2F24%2Fufc-antitrust-lawsuit-plaintiffs-oppose-summary-judgment-pitch-trial-mma-news%2F)against them, but it breathing it's last gasp through appeals.  So far it has not gained any traction to prove wrongdoing on behalf of the UFC. 

4. The UFC *does* have an [official ranking system ](https://www.ufc.com/rankings) that is conducted similar to college football, based on votes from MMA journalists. 

5. In the past few years, several UFC fighters have tested free agency and were courted by other organizations. So that seems to suggest that competition is alive and well.  For reference, see Eddie Alvarez, Ben Henderson, Rory McDonald, Gegard Mousasi, Loyoto Machida, Quinton Jackson, Phil Davis, etc. 

6. This is the most credible argument against the UFC.  They have notoriously restrictive contracts.  It's tough to source because details are rarely, if ever made public. But they contain ""right to match"" clauses that promise the UFC the right to match any offer given.  They are also rumored to have ""championship clauses"" that essentially guarantee that no one can leave as champion. 



Because of these reasons, I don't think that MMA is in the same scenario as boxing was, and the sport doesn't face the same issues. 

In addition to that, the UFC offers health insurance to its fighters, free state of the art training and health facilities, and they also pay for the most accredited company ([USADA](https://www.usada.org/) to manage the most strict anti-doping program of any major sport. 

So these things show that they are making investments for the wellbeing of fighters, unlike the situation boxing was in when the Ali reform Act went into place.",B0h1c4,,c1z103,eridd8x

> On 2 August 1964, North Vietnamese patrol torpedo boats attacked the USS Maddox (DD-731) while the destroyer was in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. There is no doubting that fact. But what happened in the Gulf during the late hours of 4 August—and the consequential actions taken by U.S. officials in Washington—has been seemingly cloaked in confusion and mystery ever since that night.

> Nearly 200 documents the National Security Agency (NSA) declassified and released in 2005 and 2006, however, have helped shed light on what transpired in the Gulf of Tonkin on 4 August. The papers, more than 140 of them classified top secret, include phone transcripts, oral-history interviews, signals intelligence (SIGINT) messages, and chronologies of the Tonkin events developed by Department of Defense and NSA officials. Combined with recently declassified tapes of phone calls from White House officials involved with the events and previously uncovered facts about Tonkin, these documents provide compelling evidence about the subsequent decisions that led to the full commitment of U.S. armed forces to the Vietnam War.

>  [...]

> On 7 August, Congress, with near unanimity, approved the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which President Johnson signed into law three days later. Requested by Johnson, the resolution authorized the chief executive to ""take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression."" No approval or oversight of military force was required by Congress, essentially eliminating the system of checks and balances so fundamental to the U.S. Constitution. On hearing of the authorization's passage by both houses of Congress, the delighted President remarked that the resolution ""was like Grandma's nightshirt. It covers everything.""

> [...]

> Historians have long suspected that the second attack in the Gulf of Tonkin never occurred and that the resolution was based on faulty evidence. But no declassified information had suggested that McNamara, Johnson, or anyone else in the decision-making process had intentionally misinterpreted the intelligence concerning the 4 August incident. More than 40 years after the events, that all changed with the release of the nearly 200 documents related to the Gulf of Tonkin incident and transcripts from the Johnson Library.

> These new documents and tapes reveal what historians could not prove: There was not a second attack on U.S. Navy ships in the Tonkin Gulf in early August 1964. Furthermore, the evidence suggests a disturbing and deliberate attempt by Secretary of Defense McNamara to distort the evidence and mislead Congress.

,"Good question. 

For sake of convenience, I'm just going to refer to them as the [1st](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2067), [2nd](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2677), and [3rd](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HB2421) bill. 

The 1st and 2nd bills, as shown at the very top of each, are targeting a very small, specific part of Virginia's code. The first bill targets:

>A BILL to amend and reenact §§ 2.2-3004, 15.2-1507, 15.2-1604, and 22.1-306 of the Code of Virginia and to amend the Code of Virginia by adding sections numbered 2.2-2901.1, 15.2-1500.1, and 22.1-295.2, relating to public employment; prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

The second bill targets: 

>A BILL to amend and reenact §§ 36-96.1 through 36-96.3, 36-96.4, 36-96.6, and 55-248.47 of the Code of Virginia, relating to the Virginia Fair Housing Law; unlawful discriminatory housing practices; sexual orientation and gender identity.

The 3rd bill, however, covers a much, much wider scope of sections, including all of the sections that would be amended by the 1st and 2nd bills. 

>A BILL to amend and reenact §§ 2.2-3004, 2.2-3900 through 2.2-3903, 2.2-4200, 2.2-4201, 2.2-4310, 2.2-4311, 2.2-4343.1, 4.1-101.05, 6.2-501, 15.2-853, 15.2-854, 15.2-965, 15.2-1131, 15.2-1507, 15.2-1604, 22.1-306, 23.1-1017, 36-55.26, 36-96.1 through 36-96.3, 36-96.4, 38.2-2114, 38.2-2115, 38.2-2212, 38.2-2213, 40.1-121, and 55-248.47 of the Code of Virginia and to amend the Code of Virginia by adding sections numbered 2.2-2901.1, 15.2-1500.1, and 22.1-295.2, relating to prohibited discrimination; sexual orientation and gender identity.

Additionally, both the 1st and 2nd bills define sexual orientation and gender identity identically:

>""Gender identity"" means the gender-related identity, appearance, or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth.

>""Sexual orientation"" means a person's actual or perceived heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality.

Interestingly, the 3rd bill does not define Gender identity or sexual orientation. This could be an oversight (assuming its already defined elsewhere or just forgetting to define them). Or, it could be on purpose. It's not uncommon for legislatures (both state and federal) to leave terms vague and allow agencies to fill in the gaps through the Rulemaking process. This could be because the legislature couldn't agree on a definition or because it wanted to avoid pinning itself to a statutory definition that would require another bill to change; an agency-defined term can changed much more easily through another Rulemaking.

Another interesting consideration is that the [1st](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+mbr+HB2067), [2nd](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+mbr+HB2677), and [3rd](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+mbr+HB2421) bills were all introduced by different people (Bell, Robinson, Levine, respectively) and have a different list of patrons. Someone more familiar with VA state politics should chime in and let us know if there is another reason for that, or just an odd idiosyncrasy.  

To directly answer your questions: the 3rd bill would substantively cover everything in the 1st and 2nd bills, but wouldn't include definitions of sexual orientation and gender identity. 

As for why 3 bills were introduced to fix two problems, I'm not sure there's a good answer to that. All three were introduced to the Rules committee before being sent to the General Laws committee, so it's not like they were attempting to take different avenues. It's possible that different groups supported different changes (e.g. Group 1 only supported the Bill 1 changes, etc.) but, again, someone more familiar with VA state politics would need to chime in with specific knowledge to confirm or deny that.

More likely is that three different groups attempted to introduce and push through the same general changes. It's possible that both bills 1 and 2 failed, circumstances with a ""no"" vote changed, bill 3 was introduced, and then the process failed and bill 3 failed anyway. State politics can be incoherent and fickle. 

At the end of the day, all 3 bills attempted to do essentially the same thing: take an existing statute and add in ""sexual orientation and gender identity"" into the list of protected groups, to ensure those groups would be protected from now on.",MilesLetum,,bzi5ox,eqwy4q3
,"It's important to understand those sanctions in the larger context of Venezuela's crisis. 

Chavez was elected in 1999 after an economic boom that didn't do much to increase wages or decrease [unemployment](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/venezuela-worst-economic-crisis-wrong-170501063130120.html). Chavez was elected for his goal of instituting a socialist revolution, and he sincerely tried to achieve that [goal]( https://www.vox.com/world/2017/9/19/16189742/venezuela-maduro-dictator-chavez-collapse), by spending lavishly on social programs. Venezuela's economy couldn't handle this new strain, so drastic changes had to be made.

Venezuela's oil industry had been pseudo-nationalized since 1976, but had been open for global cooperation since [1993](https://nacla.org/article/venezuela%27s-oil-reform-and-chavismo). The national oil corporation, PDVSA, operated semi-autonomously with good business practices to keep the industry efficient and afloat. Chavez reversed this policy after his election, bringing PDVSA under total government control, and used it to prop up his expensive social programs *Id.* PDVSA's payroll tripled as Chavez attempted to use PDVSA not just to pay for his social programs, but to hire as much unskilled labor as possible, to drive down the unemployment rate. *Id.*

In 2007, with PDVSA failing, Chavez nationalized foreign oil holdings in the country, offering the rightful owners just fractions of what the holdings were [worth](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-exxon.4.9942293.html). Since their property had been essentially stolen without payment, the foreign holders took the incident to the IMF and World Bank for litigation. *Id.* The Chavez government then pulled out of both the IMF and World Bank before they could render a decision that was adverse to the Venezuelan government. *Id.* Despite repeated attempts to help Venezuela manage the crisis, Venezuela has not had contact with either the IMF or World Bank since 2007.

To continue funding these lavish social programs, Venezuela had to borrow greatly. China alone has lent Venezuela over $50 billion in the last [10 years](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/11/04/how-long-can-venezuela-avoid-default?zid=305&ah=417bd5664dc76da5d98af4f7a640fd8a). 

This is where things take a turn for the worse. The government tried to lower the price of food with [price controls](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2011/08/20/medieval-policies) right around the same time as it instituted [strict limits](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/11/04/how-long-can-venezuela-avoid-default?zid=305&ah=417bd5664dc76da5d98af4f7a640fd8a) on holding of foreign currency and attempted to manage [land reform](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903400.html?noredirect=on). Combined, the effects were a disaster. Venezuela's land reform meant taking land from large farming operations and gifting it to small farmers. Unfortunately, the process did not go smoothly, and much of Venezuela's farm land sits idle. For the plots that *were* allocated, Venezuela didn't do anything to help the small farmers learn how to properly farm nor provide them with the equipment needed. As a result, Venezuela's food production plummeted. *Id.* Most of Venezuela's food needed to be imported, but it became incredibly difficult to do so since the government had placed strict limits on the holding of stable foreign currencies needed to import. *Id.* The government tried to react by making price controls more strict to ensure its population could still afford food that was becoming increasingly scarce, but the price controls eventually were set so low that exporters stopped exporting to Venezuela because of the inability to turn a profit. 

Chavez, in the end, was lucky. He died right before his mess collapsed. Oil prices climbed for most of Chavez's presidency. In 2014, soon after his death, oil prices collapsed. PDVSA was no longer able to fund the government's lavish expenditures, resulting in total destruction of Venezuela's economy. By the end of 2014, Venezuela's inflation rate was 69%, already the highest in the [world](https://tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/inflation-cpi ). By 2017, it had skyrocketed to [1,000%](https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/10/09/18/what-does-10000000-percent-inflation-look-like-see-venezuela). It continues to grow even today. Surveys have shown that over [80%](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/02/19/Venezuela-75-of-population-lost-19-pounds-amid-crisis/2441487523377) of Venezuelans live in poverty and [93%](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/02/19/Venezuela-75-of-population-lost-19-pounds-amid-crisis/2441487523377) cannot afford food. In 2017, it was reported that the average Venezuelan had lost a ridiculous [25 pounds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-02-22/hungry-venezuelan-workers-are-collapsing-so-is-the-oil-industry). 

So, what role has the US played?

Here is a quote from the Executive Summary of the report [you cited:](http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/venezuela-sanctions-2019-04.pdf)

>This paper looks at some of the most important impacts of the economic sanctions imposed on
Venezuela by the US government since August of 2017. 

By reading the summary provided in this comment, you know that Venezuela had already reached total collapse by 2017, with the collapse itself starting in 2014 and the roots starting as early as 1999. The Report describes the August 2017 sanctions [thusly:](http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/venezuela-sanctions-2019-04.pdf)

>The August 2017 sanctions prohibited the Venezuelan government from borrowing in US financial
markets. 

In other words, the August 2017 sanctions prevented Venezuela from servicing the massive debt load it had already accumulated. The Report describes the 2019 sanctions [as such:](http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/venezuela-sanctions-2019-04.pdf)

>The most immediate impact of the January sanctions was to cut off Venezuela from its largest oil
market, the United States, which had bought 35.6 percent of Venezuela’s oil exports in 2018, or about
586,000 barrels per day on average. 

In other worlds, the 2019 sanctions dropped Venezuela's oil exports even further.

So, again, what role has the US played in this? The sanctions have certainly not helped Venezuela. The 2019 sanctions are a large hit to Venezuela's already destroyed economy. The 2017 sanctions were certainly inconvenient, but Venezuela was already taking massive loans from Russia and China to pay for its debt and expenditure issues. That, of course, is all because Chavez pulled out of the IMF and World Bank, which also offered (and continue to offer) help. 

Your question was: 

>So my question is whether foreign (US, non-Venezuelan) actions were significant contributors to the crisis or if the majority of the blame falls on the Venezuelan government itself?

The answer is simple: Venezuela entirely did this to itself. The sanctions did not even come into effect until after Venezuela's government had totally collapsed. Complaining about foreign effects now is to totally disregard the complete mismanagement of the Venezuelan economy and government since 1999.",MilesLetum,,bzgvey,eqsmq1w
,"There is what I found to be a fairly convincing rebuttal (pdf: [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/impact-of-the-2017-sanctions-on-venezuela\_final.pdf](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/impact-of-the-2017-sanctions-on-venezuela_final.pdf)) to Sachs & Weisbrot's paper put out by Brookings. As for what they think the actual effects of the sanctions have been they only say ""While we recognize the possibility that the sanctions may have had some impact on Venezuela’s oil production, our analysis finds insufficient evidence to conclude that they were responsible for the worsening of the socio-economic crisis. There are simply no plausible counterfactuals or enough publicly available data to rigorously estimate a causal effect at this time.""",_Hrafnkel_,,bzgvey,eqtgnyo
,"From the piece by Weisbrot and Sachs they argue that it was the sanctions in August 2017 that pushed the Venezuelan economy from high inflation into hyperinflation 

*The loss of so many billions of dollars of foreign exchange and government revenues was very likely the  main  shock  that pushed  the  economy  from  its  high  inflation,  when  the  August  2017  sanctions were implemented, into the hyperinflation that followed*

Yet from world bank data we have we can see inflation doubled every year from 2014-2016. [So that inflation was around 62% in 2014 to 121.7% in 2015 and 255% in 2016](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?locations=VE). To have inflation double every year and be in the triple digits sounds like hyperinflation to me, which was well before the August 2017 sanctions which they claim were the tipping point.

Weisbrot and Sachs also argue that it was sanctions that caused the crash in Venezuelan oil production by pointing out that it fell faster then neighboring Colombia. This ignores that fact that Venezuela neglected it's oil production, failing to reinvest or even bother with basic maintenance which is essential to the heavy sour crude Venezuela produces.

[*Nearly all of Venezuela’s refining facilities have fallen into disrepair, and some facilities lack feedstock to run at rates higher than 20%–30%. A number of facilities have suffered damage from fires and operational accidents during the past few years, and PdVSA lacks the funds to repair them or invest sufficient capital to keep the facilities operating.*](https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Venezuela/background.htm)",fremenchips,,bzgvey,eqsm00o
,">So my question is whether foreign (US, non-Venezuelan) actions were significant contributors to the crisis 

It's was definitely a factor, the dropping of international oil prices was what set off the collapse of their economy. But most of the blame rests with the Venezuelan government. There are many oil rich nations that weathered the drop in oil price just fine. Iran had much stronger sanctions from many more countries and never had a crisis this bad. If anything the US's international actions pushing up the price of oil (invading Iraq, sanctioning Iran) and probably helped delay the Venezuela crisis.

Venezuela's economy was already falling apart for years before sanctions were placed on the country. Exports from Venezuela to the US [were up:](https://www.ustradenumbers.com/country/venezuela/) 

>Venezuela’s trade with the United States rose to $15.55 billion through the first 10 months of 2018, according to a WorldCity analysis of latest U.S. Census Bureau data. That’s 9.74 percent above its total trade during the same time period last year. Venezuela’s exports increased 29.42 percent while imports rose 3.26 percent. 

The US is the country that bought [half of Venezuela's oil in 2018,](http://countries.bridgat.com/Venezuela_Trade_Partners.html) up from [the ~40% in 2011.](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=9651) The problems Venezuela has in almost entirely their own doing:

>The Venezuelan government started to nationalize factories and business scaring away any foreign investment and made Venezuela uncompetitive every business that isn't oil (in 1998 oil represented 77 percent of Venezuela's exports but by 2011 [oil represented 96 percent of exports](https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/ways-chavez-destroyed-venezuelan-economy/story?id=18239956)). They also nationalized the oil industry that led to insane levels of corruption in the state run oil company (Hugo-Chavez's daughter is worth [4.2 billion](https://www.latinpost.com/articles/71424/20150812/maria-gabriela-ch%C3%A1vez-net-worth-hugo-ch%C3%A1vezs-daughter-richest-woman-in-venezuela-worth-4-2-billion.htm)). So when the price of oil collapsed the whole economy fell apart and millions starved (unlike every other oil rich country).

>That's not to mention the government [mismanaging farms](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903400.html) that resulted in *increased* Venezuelan food imports. Add on the price controls, the subsidies, the nationalization of many industries, the economic mismanagement, the lack of basic knowledge of economics.",informat2,,bzgvey,eqtjlcr
,"There's a lot of evidence that regardless of individual policy polling, being a ""progressive"" is considered an electoral disadvantage.  First, it is important to think about group mentality over policy positions because that's [how people vote](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/1/15515820/donald-trump-democracy-brexit-2016-election-europe). We see people [changing their beliefs to match their affiliation](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo28246146.html), not the other way around. From that, only a small minority of the population, [8%, identify as progressive](https://hiddentribes.us/).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So how do progressive candidates fair? Well, after the 2018 election, the Progressive Democrats and New Democrat Coalition (a moderate group) [are roughly equal](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-will-have-just-as-many-moderate-democrats-as-progressives-next-year/) in the House Democratic Caucus. But that means even in a Blue Wave year, Progressives are not the majority, even within the Democratic party. It's definitely a sizable amount, [44%](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/29/659665970/as-more-democrats-embrace-progressive-label-it-may-not-mean-what-it-used-to), but still not the majority, and definitely not the majority in the entire voting electorate. We also see that New Democrats did better in redder districts, [of which there are more of than blue ones](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/02/26/is-a-wave-rolling-in-for-house-democrats/). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And looking at the primaries for Democrats in 2018, we see a similar story. Progressives do decently, but moderates beat them on average. [The Party committees won most of their endorsements, while Sander's Our Revolution only won 32% of their endorsements](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-establishment-is-beating-the-progressive-wing-in-democratic-primaries-so-far/). Now, people may get upset about comparing establishment candidates over progressives, but the fact remains that being ""in"" the more moderate circles helps getting elected.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And finally, there is the presidential election so far. [Biden is around 30% nationally, while Sanders is only at 15%](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/national/). Warren, another progressive, is around 10%. Harris, O'Rouke, Buttigieg, and Booker are all somewhere next in single digits.

While the poll you cited suggested Americans support taxes for the wealthy, both politically conservative and liberal economists predict that in the short - medium term Medicare for All would need to be financed through a tax increase for the middle class:

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/10/upshot/medicare-for-all-bernie-sanders-cost-estimates.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share

I’m guessing this would be true for free college as well, although I think there have been fewer detailed cost estimates of that type of plan.

Edit: also a lot of the polling support or nonsupport for M4A depends on how the question is phrased

,"A couple things.

* [Medicare for All approval depends greatly on the details](https://www.apnews.com/4516833e7fb644c9aa8bcc11048b2169)
* Tax on the rich would have to get passed the Supreme Court as it is probably a direct tax, which is only legal on income through the 16th amendment.

The latter is especially important, because many of these programs are going to be expensive, and it seems to be the only tax plan that does not include raising taxes on the middle. With SALT deductions going away, and likely being more difficult to reintroduce than they were to get rid of, I think progressive centers are going to start seeing the impact on their pocket books for the policies they're trying to push if they start imposing the taxes they're going to need to impose to support them. Either that or they're going to need to start seriously trimming fat, which has never been something the federal government has excelled at under either party.

> With poll numbers such as these, have we seen or not seen success in the voting booth for these types of policies?

I would say that the current make up of representatives at state/federal levels makes it pretty clear that we have not seen success in the voting booth for a lot of these types of policies. Republicans hold 62% of the legislative chambers across all states, they control both chambers of 61% of the states, and control 45% of the legislative and executive levels of all states. It's really hard to say that Progressives are very successful at the voting booth.

,"I am interested in this topic just from my general curiosity in how much kick-ass mathematics and mathematicians seemed to have come from that part of the world.

For question 1.) - Are we starting from a place where there an embedded assumption that the reason why Soviet Ministries operated dysfunctionally due to those incentive structures only?  Or are we also looking at the societal, ""momentum"" that Russia started with prior to the Communist revolution?  Something that gets missed is that the Russian Empire was essentially a serfdom, a backwater when compared to the rest of Europe, prior to the 20th Century (and even during).  While it's common knowledge that the Soviet Union excelled in propaganda and subjugating people, we must not forget that we in the Western World and the United States specifically also were subject to a fair amount of propaganda, or at least common belief systems which have driven portrayals in popular media - because it's hard to create a popular story and write or show something in a movie that's not grounded in what the audience accepts as generally true.  So - a lot of how we in the United States have attempted to design our society has been based upon, ""proper incentive structures,"" however we also had a huge amount of momentum as a society being that we were originally part of England, and that society had achieved more governmental and technical advancements in terms of democracy, science, infrastructure than almost any other country in the world by the mid to late 1700s.  Meanwhile Russia was comparatively still living in the dark ages.  I don't know if I need to cite this as I think this is widely understood.  I also think it's common sense that societies with more technological and organizational momentum generally continue forward with that same momentum.

So apart from that, if you accept the above propositions, then here is an interesting point made from /r/history:

[Probably the most significant event in the development of mathematics there was at the end of the century, during Catherine, when St. Petersburg managed to attract a group of mathematicians from Basel in Switzerland - Nicolaus and Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler - who were some of the best in the world at that time.. indeed some of the greatest of all time! So even though the talent was imported, suddenly Petersburg was a world center in mathematics. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/905el9/how_did_the_soviet_union_get_so_good_at_math/)

So basically, you have a lot of societal momentum from the Russian Empire importing some of the best mathematicians of all time into what was otherwise a sort of backwater and creating a hub of expertise - sort of like how certain regions within countries became really good at weaving or wine making or whatever, sometimes through importation of expertise.

[This paper](https://www.emis.de/classics/HAT/fpapers/lorentzussr.pdf) talks about a time in which scientists and academics were persecuted in the early 1930s, as Stalin's ""liquidation of the Kulaks"" or upper-classish people happened.  Basically, two things happened simultaneously, a lot of higher-qualified white collar workers were removed from their positions, while at the same time a lot of former serfs were moved into white collar positions (for better or for worse).  A lot of how this was done was through State Trials, some of which were publicized for propaganda purposes.  Certain objective conclusions from various fields of science - such as biology or physics, did not, ""tow the party line,"" and were called into question.  For example, Einstein's theory of relativity pointed toward an infinitely expanding Universe, which hints at the existence of a God of some sort, which was anti-Communist.  As a result, mathematicians had to start asking interesting, hard questions and use more creativity to come up with different results - for example, ""Do integers, circles, and lines exist in reality?""  So that rough, ""liquidation of the Kulaks,"" period, as cruel as it was, may have introduced a larger philosophical flavor into the field of mathematics as academics competed for resources.  After that, Soviet Society went into more of a long period of conservatism, things got more dropped into silos, and Mathematics was one of the areas of focus that was identified as something that could move the Soviet Union forward.  So with resources being given at a very high level in society to extremely smart mathematicians who could then use those resources to fund research objectives, and having a new, ""labor force"" of all of these newly minted white collar type folks, and entering into a time when people felt more safe about their continued ability to not be sent to a Gulag, while at the same time having had to previously question the very nature of reality - that made for some conditions for mathematical research the likes of which the world has never seen.

Meanwhile in the United States, which also had its own form of mathematical advancements in the 1930s-1950s, a lot of it was directed towards things that were very Economical and Business-related in nature,  because that was what as more likely to receive grand funding in most cases, while Soviet math was just kind of, ""anything worthwhile.""  So Soviet math was able to concentrate toward, ""fundamental math,"" which is not an area that gets covered.

There was a paper comparing and contrasting American and Soviet mathematics which came to this conclusion which I read a few years ago, but I can't find it now.

So prior to the Soviet Union, there was just not a lot of expertise among the general population, and then you had all of these basically ignorant serfs in charge (with absolutely no malice toward that ignorance, it was just a fact) - and they did the best they could under the conditions they had, created some chaotic conditions, and then that lead to further advancement in a huge way.  The fact that Russia had so much mathematical expertise prior to this to begin with also helped considerably.

Since you reference popular media, a really great movie that kind of touches on this kind of inter-revolutionary time period is Dr. Zhivago.  Excellent movie - it basically goes through pre and post Communist Revolution and follows this upper class, educated Doctor who, despite having a lot of capability, was considered upper class, and ends up having to come to terms with that previous Russian Imperial hierarchy through which he had benefited, and you get a sense of how a lot of folks were just of low capability, and yet were now  put in charge of running society, while this Dr. Zhivago guy could see a lot of obvious, glaring problems but couldn't really do too much about it.  He goes on to live his life (which is what the movie is really about), with all of this chaos around him - basically showing that it's not like everyone intelligent in the Soviet Union was completely purged out, they were still around, just living in a different way - perhaps contributing how they did previously, perhaps not.

One could argue that the inefficiencies inherent in society were largely due to the political and inefficient nature of communist systems, but you could also say, well maybe X% of that inefficiency was due to communist organization, but then Y% was because there was just a huge overhaul in society and the general population just didn't have a lot of expertise or education to begin with.  Maybe if the Soviet Union had remained the Russian Empire there would have been even more mathematical advancements...but at the same time if you would have had less labor force working in mathematics, and different incentives directing people's thoughts and ways of making a living, maybe it would not have achieved as much.  It's impossible to say, which is one of the reasons why the Socialism vs. Capitalism debate continues to this day - though Socialism had clear flaws, there were also some real human advancements that did not occur under our own system, and that gives the Socialist side of the debate at least some small ground to stand on.",BravewardSweden,,bya7wz,eqiuw2v

,"The very short answer to your question is ""no"". 

The slightly longer answer is that it is incredibly difficult to get accurate statistics on this sort of data due to the nature of gun owners and the nature of the incidents such data is trying to track. 

https://www.npr.org/2018/04/13/602143823/how-often-do-people-use-guns-in-self-defense

First, it's difficult to get an accurate idea of the number of guns and gun owners. There is no national registry in the first place, and gun owners are notoriously skittish about answering surveys about their guns. If you'd like first-hand proof of this, put together a survey yourself and post it on /r/firearms. Most of your answers will probably be ""none of your business"". You might even get falsified data due to the desire of some in the community to hinder information-gathering efforts. For example, when New Zealand enacted their recent gun control laws after the Christchurch shooting it became a meme on various gun subreddits to post a picture of your guns and claim you were from New Zealand (these posts should still be up where you can see them). This was done in an effort to hinder confiscation efforts from New Zealand law enforcement. You can get a lower-limit estimate based on the number of [NICS background checks conducted](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view) but that doesn't cover home manufacturing (a growing field), older firearms, or other niche cases. It also doesn't cover the ""black market"" of guns that have been sold or made illegally. Really it's anyone's guess as to how many guns the US has, my bet would be at least 500 million. 

Second, defensive gun use is inherently hard to track. The obvious cases are where someone dies or goes to the hospital, which is almost always reported to police. The less-obvious cases are where someone simply draws their weapon or announces that they have one. Is it still defensive gun use if you don't fire a shot? I'd be inclined to say yes since the presence of the gun is what made the difference, but others may disagree. You could conduct a survey of this, but I feel that might be inaccurate as well due to the private nature of such events. Someone may not want to share their experience, they might not think it counts, or they may just forget about it if it wasn't a physical altercation. Another factor would be the deterrent effect of ""Open carry""; it's impossible to quantify the effect that wearing a visible firearm has on potential criminals, although it could very well be a negative effect since guns are popular targets for robbery. If you ask a pro-gun activist about defensive gun use they'll probably say 3 million/year is the number because of a study from the 90's that produced that number. If you ask someone else they might say 100,000/year because that's the number some other study came up with. The variance of the numbers (IMO) demonstrates how difficult it is to track these statistics. 

I suppose you could attempt to do a comparison of similar areas where one allows CCW (Concealed Carry Weapons) and the other does not, measuring the crime stats between the two, but controlling for all the other factors that influence crime would be pretty difficult I think. You could also measure the difference when an area goes from restricted CCW to unrestricted, but that might be hard to control for as well. It also doesn't help that carry laws vary *building to building* in many places, too. You can't carry in Post Offices, you usually can't carry near schools, you usually can't carry near state government buildings, and you definitely can't carry on federal property (except some parks, sometimes). Then there are different regulations for different people. [LEOSA](https://leosaonline.com/), for example, allows police officers (current and retired) to carry pretty much anywhere, no matter the state. The point I'm trying to get at here is that the whole country has CCW in some form or another, but there is a lot of variance to the actual application of it. For practical purposes, never assume that nobody around you has a gun. Even in the heart of the most anti-gun cities people could be carrying legally or illegally. I'm sure this is probably terrifying to a European but this is just how the US is. 

I might show a little bias here, but the gun community *loves* to keep statistics about this sort of thing where they can. The general sentiment among self-avowed ""gun nuts"" is that statistics are on the side of gun owners, so gun forums are inundated with all sorts of studies and stats. /r/ccw and /r/dgu have lots of stories and discussions about defensive gun use. There are also lots of sites out there for CCW statistics, [here] (https://www.gunstocarry.com/concealed-carry-statistics/) is one and I'm sure there are a ton of others. Yes, they're biased because they're trying to promote CCW, but I think the information itself is still worth looking at.

Edit: And another thing! It should be noted that there is a LOT of grey area when it comes to legal or illegal gun use. What is legal and justifiable in one state might not be in another. The most high-profile example is probably George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin. Legal in Florida, but could have easily gone very differently in a different state or even a different city in Florida.

Edit 2: I should further clarify that by ""Legal in Florida"" I mean ""didn't get convicted or go to jail"". That it probably *wasn't* a justified shooting just goes to show that gun use is complicated at every stage and that every situation is different.",Maswasnos,,bwxa41,eq2zmtr
,"It isn't quite directly what you're asking, but there is evidence that people who have a concealed weapons permit (in those states that require it), are significantly less likely to commit crimes than the general population and police.

,"Start with John Lott's ""More Guns, Less Crime."" The 3rd edition includes additional data and addresses many of the ""criticisms"" leveled at previous editions of the book. It is not easy to read, and a basic understanding of research methodology is very helpful.

Specifically, ask a question, determine the ""best"" way to answer that question, then try and gather data that will do so. Ideally, the data gathering will be done based on pre-set criteria (no cheating to get the answer you are looking for...), and we the reader can decide for ourselves if the data has been gathered in an intellectually honest way IF the methods are transparent.

How to determine the rate of gun carrying in public? How to determine what crimes may or may not be affected by the gun carrying populace? Is a person with a concealed carry license who is carrying a legally purchased firearm in public the same as a person who is carrying an illegally purchased firearm in public, and doing so illegally (i.e. is a prohibited possessor)? 

Etc. Which means also looking at criticisms of Mr. Lott's data and analysis, and determining for yourself which seem to be more likely to reflect truth in the universe.

To quote this [Vox article](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000520/gun-risk-death), 
> Guns can kill you in three ways: homicide, suicide, and by accident. Owning a gun or having one readily accessible makes all three more likely. 

> States with more guns see [more accidental deaths](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-threats-and-self-defense-gun-use/) from firearms, and [children ages 5 to 14 are 11 times more likely to be killed with a gun](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1559827610396294) in the US compared to other developed countries, where gun ownership is much less common. 

Vox admittedly has left-leaning bias but it sources its claims (although some are broken...the 5-14 age being one of them -- I could only find the abstract). 

[ This author critiques the data behind the Vox claims](https://www.guns.com/news/2015/08/24/kellermanns-gun-ownership-studies-after-two-decades) and takes issue with how the source data was selected. [Correlation is not causation](https://xkcd.com/552/) and it make sense that people who want the protection of a gun might also live in a place with a greater risk of gun violence. 

Regardless, the fact remains that [more children die from gun deaths](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/140/1/e20163486) [than from school shootings](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/05/lockdown-drill-fear/589090/). It follows that in the US, children are more likely to die from accidental gun deaths than a school shooting.

&#x200B;

Personally, I think having a monopoly discussion is far less important than data privacy protections. Breaking up Facebook, Google, or any of the big tech companies is simply a band-aid on the real problem: personal data. Five years from now, we'll likely have to breakup the next Google or Facebook because the problem was never the ""monopoly"" on specific free products, it's the collection of the personal data. This gives more power back to the users about the kind of information that is being collected about them and it also allows people to punish companies that misuse their data by mass requesting deletion of their data. This would hold these companies more accountable to their users beyond just holding their attention, in my opinion. 

&#x200B;

BUT that being said, another big factor that people aren't considering is this is no longer about the US economy. We are living in a global economy now and we are competing with global companies who are doing similar things in the tech world and if we breakup and hamper our biggest companies that have international market share, them breaking up would mean that the global economy would stop relying on US tech companies, which ultimately would be bad for us.

One common set of arguments against helmet laws has its basis in [libertarian thinking:](https://reason.com/2010/11/25/the-case-against-motorcycle-he) such laws amount to an infringement on individual liberty by way of the government protecting citizens from their own choices.

Motorcycles are indeed dangerous, but [cardiovascular disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease) is the [world's leading cause of death,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate) and two of its [preventable risk factors are poor diet and lack of exercise.](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/behavior.htm) Yet there's [very little public support](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1465816/Your-view-Should-the-Government-do-more-to-promote-healthy-eating.html) for the government limiting the number of cheeseburgers you can eat or mandating exercise. Such ideas are seen as paternalistic infringements on the private lives of citizens. People can be made aware of the risks, but the decision on whether to take them is theirs.

Many [motorcycle riders feel the same way.](https://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/readers-opinion/article164419777.html) Why is it the government's job to perform risk management for adults (the State has a legitimate interest in protecting the safety of minors) who are presumed to have the liberty of their own decisions? Lots of people decide to do things that may be considered dangerous, like skiing, mountain biking, rock climbing, swimming in the ocean. Why don't we limit or ban those?

A common counterargument is that society bears the healthcare costs of treating injuries sustained by motorcycle riders who have accidents while not wearing helmets. But this is the case with those above-mentioned activities and lifestyle habits too.

In my view, these aggregate costs are the price of liberty. I get to do what I want because other people get to do what they want, so long as the only person we're all putting at risk is ourselves. Some of the behaviors people choose to engage in are going to be riskier than others and they'll cost society money in the aggregate. But if the country is truly free, those costs are inherent. Or, put another way, if the government is telling you what choices you can and cannot make with your own body, it's not a free country.

I don't ride a motorcycle, but I encourage anyone who does to wear a helmet. Per OP's sources, the data strongly supports that you are much safer doing so. I just don't favor the government making the decision for you.

The repeal of these laws stems from the premise that the government does not actually have the right to protect you from yourself.

The same logic needs to be applied to many laws, it just isn't. Not enough of society understands that if it's a good idea, you don't need threats, and the people who don't do it when it's a good idea are also likely to just ignore the law altogether.

My supposition is that this doesn’t extend to seat belts because the difference in fatalities isn’t as dramatic, but that it probably is more expensive on average to insurance companies to pay for the injuries of a person not wearing a seat belt versus one who is.

Mootness basically means that there is not a live controversy for the Court to decide.  Because the federal courts only have the power to decide actual [cases or controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_or_Controversy_Clause), the federal courts lack jurisdiction to hear moot cases.

A case can become moot for factual or legal reasons.  Say, for example, you sue for an injunction to stop your neighbor from building something.  If, by the time the case reaches the court your neighbor has already built the structure, the case is moot because the facts underlying the claim are no longer in place.  (Note any claim for damages would not be moot).

Legal mootness can occur in the situation you've described. If the state or entity changes the challenged law, the case is moot.  However, to prevent state actors from intentionally mooting cases in this fashion, the case is not deemed moot if the state actor is free to change the law back.  This is the ""[voluntary cessation](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS22599.html#_Toc230583188)"" exception to the mootness doctrine.

,"The two the legal concepts that might persuade the US Supreme Court to drop a legal dispute based on a change in the law are [ripeness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripeness) or [mootness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mootness). In the NY gun ordinance case, mootness is going to be the legal concept that New York will argue to try and get a dismissal. Ripeness is when, “a claim [...] rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,” which is to prevent courts being asked to resolve theoretical disputes. 

Mootness on the other hand is derived from the US Constitution’s Article III, that governs the establishment of Federal Courts and requires that for a dispute to be resolved by a federal judge there must be an active “case or controversy.” In this case, [New York will argue](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/us/politics/supreme-court-gun-control.html) that any further adjudication on its gun ordinance is moot because it’s changing the ordinance to alleviate the issue the plaintiff originally sued on. It’s hard to judge the merits whether this strategy will be successful.  This strategy of changing the law to moot a case has worked for lower courts, in similar situations—namely, [Moore v. Madigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_v._Madigan), where the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals dismisses a challenge to an Illionois ban on issuing concealed carry permits after the Illinois legislature amended the law to remove the strict ban. The difference here though is that Supreme Court has already agreed to hear the case and they are fully free to set their own docket and pick-and-choose the cases they take. Since they’ve agreed to take the New York gun ordinance case, they may be looking to expand on, clarify, or cement their ruling in [District of Columbia v. Heller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller), which establishes an individual right to own a gun but was otherwise fairly limited, and they may make New York defend its law regardless of its mootness so that the court can settle the issue nationally with a new precedent ruling. 

The rational for proceeding in such a fashion could be based on either of two exceptions to the mootness doctrine, when a case has secondary or collateral legal consequences or is capable of repetition, yet evades review. The former exception is when there is a continuing effect from the law even if the law has been changed, which in this case could be people like the plaintiff who suffered consequences from the ordinance. The latter exception is for cases where people will face a particular situation that could easily reoccur again in the future but due to the slow speed of the judicial system, they will not be able to get an adequate resolution before their particular instance of the issue is resolved. The letter exception is often construed pretty narrowly by courts.",Metafx,,bwc5cl,epwnn9m

(Though even if they were, I would argue it would still be a good thing, because anyone wishing to change the policy would have to fight two court battles, not just one.) But they are not mere repetitions of each other. Here is the actual text of the executive order:

https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/eo-1-equal-opportunity.pdf

As you can see, this order:

- Establishes that the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management will be responsible for interpreting policy details;
- Establishes that the Office of Equal Employment Services will be responsible for handling complaints and ensuring compliance;
- Directs the Secretary of Administration to conduct an annual review of how well these policies are actually being carried out;
- Authorizes disciplinary action against employees violating the policy (the law can only authorize statutory punishments like fines and jail time);
- Directs that performance standards not be reduced in the pursuit of diversity.

None of these *specific* things are required by the law. The law just codifies what actions are prohibited. The point of the executive order is to establis *how* these policies are going to be enacted in the state government organization, and *who* is specifically on the hook for implementing them.

Many other commenters here are saying that this is strictly a photo op, that the executive order has no purpose other than politics. But consider what would happen if the order were rescinded. It would no longer be the DDHRM's job to interpret the law; interpretation would have to be done through the courts. This would mean that anyone discriminated against would have to *bring* a court case, so it would greatly increase the cost and difficulty of getting an appropriate resolution to a discrimination event. And so on for each of the bullet points above.

Tl;dr - the governor doesn't *have* to institute a robust anti-discrimination policy. He *could* adopt a policy of reluctantly complying with the letter of the law only when ordered by a court to do so.

The same question comes out during the Census question. Is there a legitimate reason for this question to be included?

That said, courts martial are valid processes under American law in respect to military affairs, and the prosecution of war crimes cases is a classic area where the jurisdiction of courts martial would apply.  Also the Slatten case was tried in ordinary [federal court.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/blackwater-security-guard-convicted-in-2007-iraqi-civilian-massacre-at-third-us-trial/2018/12/19/e8b3d8ac-fd5f-11e8-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html?utm_term=.d19522a88191)

Now as to the substance, there are two key differences I see.

**Commutations vs. Pardons**

First, the Calley case was a commutation, not a pardon.  A commutation [does not extinguish the underlying conviction,](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/04/presidential-pardons-explanation-executive-clemency-powers/660381002/) but serves only to shorten or otherwise make more lenient the sentence imposed.

In this case, we are discussing full pardons.  It may be that Trump would commute sentences instead of pardoning in some of the cases, but that would not be possible in the Gallagher and Golsteyn cases as they have not have any sentence imposed yet, and a commutation can only work after an initial sentence is handed down.

The commutation versus pardon distinction is extremely important in respect to law of war offenses because a commutation does not attack the idea that there should be some punishment for war crimes, but only seeks to change a particular sentence imposed in a particular case.

Full scale pardons on the other hand, _especially_ pardons issued before a finding of guilt, send a clear message that the underlying alleged conduct has the support of the executive of the country.

The crimes alleged against Gallagher and Golsteyn, and of which Slatten was convicted, are considered [grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.](https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/resources/documents/faq/5zmgf9.htm)  Formal endorsement of those grave breaches by the US government is a massive breach of our obligations under international law.

**Mass pardons vs one case**

The other distinguishing feature of the proposed pardons is that they would be done as a group in respect to unrelated cases separated in time, place, parties and circumstances.  The only common thread is that they are Americans accused or convicted of war crimes.  

To issue a big group of pardons that have no relationship but forgiving war crimes is to emphasize that the government is essentially saying those war crimes were acceptable conduct, and signaling that future war crimes will be tolerated or forgiven by the government.

There are cases where mass pardons of war crimes have been appropriate, but they have almost always followed something like a broadly searching inquiry and a strongly stated public reason to not bring charges.  The most famous example would be [South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa\))

,"So a couple things. First I’ll start with your last point about presumption of innocence. That’s what mueller was ultimately agreeing with. Because his investigation was tasked with investigating criminal behavior and making prosecutorial judgements, his decisions (to prosecute or not) would ultimately just go to trial.  He stated yesterday that

> [I]t would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.

His position was not to be judge or jury over trumps guilt, it was only to decide if there was sufficient evidence to proceed with criminal charges, aka a formal accusation, that in a normal instance would be tried in court and would give the accused an opportunity for a fair defense and places the burden of proof on the accuser (aka innocent until proven guilty). But due to the fact that mueller agree with the OLC memo that says a sitting president can’t be indicted, there was no court system that could try this case, meaning its improper to make an accusation without giving the accused an opportunity to defend it. 

>A special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.

This last quote goes more to your original question as to what was different. Mueller was appointed under the DOJ. Starr gave his report directly to congress. From the [starr report Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starr_Report) :

> After the four year investigation of Clinton, the Office of the Independent Counsel delivered its 445-page report to Congress on September 9, 1998.

The reason this matters is that mueller was not asked to determine if trump should be impeached, he was tasked with finding out if there was enough evidence to proceed with charging crimes over the Russian election interference. Where as Starr was allowed to prosecute crimes he uncovered, his report was given to congress which is the body that has oversight over the executive branch and impeachment capabilities. 

TL;DR: mueller was tasked with prosecuting crimes and was under the DOJ, Starr was able to prosecute crimes but was ultimately reporting to congress where an impeachment referral is more fitting.",karkovice1,,buta8z,epipjuw
,"Kenneth Starr has been widely criticized as a political hack since (basically) the day after the impeachment hearings.

Essentially the rules governing Independent/Special Counsels have changed since the Ken Starr released his report.

https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/sitting-president%E2%80%99s-amenability-indictment-and-criminal-prosecution

The OLC memo that Robert Mueller references in his report as well as during his press conference yesterday is linked above.

It establishes that the President is essentially immune to criminal prosecution while in office, and thus that Robert Mueller and his team cannot accuse the President of a crime, since he cannot go to court to defend himself against that accusation. 

Thus under Justice Department policy this prevents Mueller from listing charges against Donald Trump in his report. There are charges against other individuals in the report however, since they are not protected from Federal Prosecution.

However, it does not require him to declare that the President did not commit a crime, though it is possible for him to do so if he thought that were the case.

Mueller's words on the OLC Memo:

> It explains that under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that, too, is prohibited. A special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.

---

> And as set forth in the report, after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/politics/mueller-transcript.html?module=inline

So, the analysis is then this:

1. Mueller cannot charge obstruction of Justice due to OLC Memo
2. He can however say that the President did not commit a crime
3. He does not say so

Therefore by a common sense analysis Mueller is essentially saying: ""I cannot charge this man with a crime despite being able to investigate, we think he committed the crime however, so we are not going to state that he did not commit this crime, and Congress should use the evidence in the report to perform their trial""

> First, the opinion explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting president, because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents available. Among other things, that evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be charged now.

,"The laws creating the office of Independent Counsel (Ken Starr) and the Special Counsel are incredibly different. They were operating under entirely different legal guidelines. In my opinion, the best way to look at the differences is to read through the actual laws creating the offices. 

https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.7

Here is a part of the law governing Mueller, which explicitly states that he must follow all DOJ guidelines. 

""A Special Counsel shall comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice. He or she shall consult with appropriate offices within the Department for guidance with respect to established practices, policies and procedures of the Department, including ethics and security regulations and procedures.""

In this case, Mueller could not simply decide to go against DOJ policy and take the president to trial. Because the president cannot be tried, constitutionally he cannot be accused of a crime by the government. Mueller was also required to seek advice on these regulations from the DOJ if warranted, which he did. 

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/595#

This is the law creating independent counsel. The independent counsel, while still under the AG, was required to report to directly to Congress, particularly any evidence that may potentially merit impeachment. The independent counsel was also appointed by a panel of judges, which separates some of the conflicts of interest of the executive branch investigating itself. 

""An independent counsel shall advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible information which such independent counsel receives, in carrying out the independent counsel’s responsibilities under this chapter, that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.""

You can look for the same stipulation in the law creating special counsel, but it doesn't exist. The Special Counsel has nothing to do with Congress or their duties, including recommending impeachment.",EuphioMachine,,buta8z,erhipw8
,"I don't think it changed anything significant, and I think this [The Hill article](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/446018-mueller-speaks-five-takeaways) outlines some of the points as to why.

For starters, per The Hill article, Nancy Pelosi and Jerrold Nadler both still aren't calling for impeachment to begin (however they aren't ruling it out) just that they should continue investigating Trump. Additionally, as stated in the OP, Mueller didn't say anything today about his work that wasn't already in his report, and as seen with Republicans like Lindsey Graham and Doug Collin's have said (see earlier hill article), it as such didn't change their minds, meaning that even if an impeachment proceeding began and passed the house, it would be [dead on arrival](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/445512-senate-gop-pledges-to-quickly-quash-any-trump-impeachment-charges) in the senate as was the case beforehand.

The most significant things to come out of Mueller's press conference were these lines IMO:

> Those were the principles under which we operated and from them we concluded that we would not reach a determination, one way or the other, about whether the President committed a crime. That is the office’s — that is the office’s final position, and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the President.

This is Mueller effectively saying ""if you ask me to assume that the DoJ policies didn't exist and I could decide if Trump obstructed Justice, I'm not going to answer that question.""

> Now I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner. I am making that decision myself. No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter. There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report.

This is Mueller essentially firing a political warning shot at congress, which is why Jerrold Nadler said that [Mueller told him what he wanted to hear](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/445995-nadler-on-possible-mueller-subpoena-he-told-us-a-lot-of-what-we-need-to-hear). Mueller doesn't want to testify before congress, and he's saying that is his own determination, not Trump or the DoJ's. So if Democrats decide to subpoena him, which they worry could have bad optics, they would have to do so understanding that the only person they could blame in this situation for them doing so is Mueller, and they'd hesitate to do that.

> So beyond what I have said here today, and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress

As Mueller said today, ""the report is my testimony"", and I believe that his intent in releasing the report, as backed by the above quote, was for the DoJ and Congress to decide what to do with it from there and not ask him for further input or comment on his opinion.

In conclusion, Mueller didn't do anything today to change anyone's mind, and he said that he isn't going to do anymore to try and change people's minds. His work is done, and anything further he says will be constrained to only what is in the report itself.",Darkframemaster43,,bugvks,epdmgco

It's not an exact parallel, but it does outline the political considerations in holding impeachment proceedings and how those considerations contribute to the final outcome. It might be confirmation bias. But, the most frequent comparison of the present situtation is either to Nixon or Clinton because they were the most recent examples of impeachment proceedings, though the political climate and circumstances feel closer to an Iran-Contra situation that it makes it probable that things will never get as far as impeachment.

So while many have speculated that this was his (Mueller's) view all along, today we finally have confirmation of this. 

I also think he provided clarity/reiteration regarding the difference between the full report and Barr's initial summary. In regards to Barr's misrepresentation of the full report, especially now that we know Mueller's view on whether a sitting president can be charged with crimes relating to obstruction.

,"I believe it does. Up until now there have been a lot of politicized statements made about the report that, according to the contents of the report, misrepresent Mueller's findings. 

[Mueller's statement](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/robert-mueller-statement-russia-investigation-text-transcript-1346453) emphasized two critical facts: first, that the investigation was not in a position to charge the president (based on DOJ policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president), and second, that based on the evidence, the investigation was not able to exonerate the president, stating:
""If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.""

Furthermore, [the Report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) states clearly:

>""The conclusion that Congress may apply obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.""

to me, Mueller's statement is making clear that there is sufficient evidence that, absent DOJ policy prohibiting it, trump could be charged with multiple crimes, and that he is calling on congress to impeach.

,"It's not clear what you mean by ""the political situation"". Political is defined as either ""relating to the government and affairs of a country"" or as ""relating to the ideas or strategies of a particular political party or group in politics"".

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/political

In either case, what would you look for as evidence that the ""political situation"" changed? Chairman Nadler of the House Judiciary Committee made a comment immediately after the Mueller press conference that said, in part:

>""Given that Special Counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump – and we will do so.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z3n7WXLq4Q

One can argue that this is not a change in the HJC ""strategy or ideas"" that they've already been pursuing. By that measure, there is only further reinforcement of the existing ""political situation"".

Speaker Pelosi also made a statement:

https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/52919/

Again, while she reinforces her position on Congress holding the President accountable through the oversight process, and a reference to HR1, a bill to protect election systems, this doesn't represent a significant ""change"" from her previously existing stance.

Trump responded. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1133759237136494592

That also does not represent a change in any political situation.

By every reasonable measure, no significant change in the ""political situation"" seems to be observable. However, there are a lot of articles in the press today indicating that Democrats are putting more pressure on their leadership to begin impeachment hearings. It's reasonable to cite that as an early indication that there might be some change occurring in the political situation, but it's too early to tell (the Mueller press conference was 7 hours ago when I'm typing this).

>And in a second volume, the report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president.
The order appointing the Special Counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. And we conducted that investigation and we kept the Office of the Acting Attorney General apprised of the progress of our work.
  
>And as set forth in the report after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.
  
>We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime. The introduction to the volume two of our report explains that decision. It explains that under long-standing Department policy, a President cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that too is prohibited. The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that Department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.
 
So they had the opportunity to exonerate the president from obstruction of justice charges but didn't because it was the DOJ's guidelines that sitting presidents couldn't be indicted with federal charges, which should put to rest the notion that there's ""no collusion, no obstruction"" when in fact the special counsel's investigation leaves that up to the Congress to charge and adjudicate because there was evidence for obstruction charges, but presidents can only get justice (findings of guilty or not guilty) outside of the conventional criminal justice system, for federal charges at least. It **SHOULD** put to rest that there can be an impeachment initiated, but Pelosi is making the political calculation that an impeachment, even if the evidence shows the president to very likely committed several federal felonies including, but not only, being the unindicted co-conspirator of Michael Cohen and nearly a dozen counts of obstruction of justice.",SeanFromQueens,,bugvks,epdw1id

,"From a strictly *realpolitik* perspective, merit-focused immigration policies disrupt middle-class occupations, while our current regime is focused on using immigration to keep low-skill labor costs low. Currently a majority of immigrant ""H"" visas are for agricultural or agriculture-adjacent work (https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-backs-plan-for-more-h-2b-visas-irking-critics-of-immigrant-labor-rules-11557048600) and this has resulted, predictably, in steady, low wages for agricultural workers. (https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216) Remaining immigrants often find work in similar low-skill fields, like manufacturing.

A large-scale shift towards high-skill immigrants, be it from India, Asia, or Europe, would mean that the flow of cheap labor to low-skill industries would become stuttered, and a new flow would open up into traditionally immigration-resistant fields, especially in STEM. While this would obviously be offset by skeptical firms that distrust the credentials many overseas universities offer, it nevertheless would lead to a greater supply of medium- to high-skill workers in fields that are already bordering on oversaturation. 

It could, however, potentially raise wages for lower income Americans, both immigrant and native, as these high-skilled immigrants will not be competing for the same work. 

The question then becomes, is this worth it to politicians? Lower class Americans certainly play a role in the political system, but middle class Americans are probably more dangerous to anger. Especially considering how currently many are generally favorable to immigration, as their fields are relatively protected from disruption. For this reason I believe such bills are unlikely to pass. It's a sort of NIMBY-ism, where low-skill immigrants are appreciated for keeping low-skill labor low, and therefore costs low, while the middle-class Americans have little to fear from their own professions being affected.",auraphauna,,bu1p7i,ep6iws8

Opinions on any ""merit based"" systems are going to inevitably be based on what the plan defines merit as and where it places the bar for people to be meritorious enough.

,"Do you mean this particular plan specifically? Or merit-based immigration in any form? We've had some form of merit based immigration for a long time now, just not to this degree. At least that's my understanding.

Edit: I mean one common way to get a visa is to get accepted to a university or get sponsored by an employer. That indicates some level of merit. https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate.html",Average650,,bu1p7i,ep6gu3a
,"No details of the policy have emerged that I can see, so it's impossible to say for sure what it'll mean.

Generally, merit-based immigration refers to things like H-1B visas, which is for technical and skilled labor. Someone on an H-1B work visa can stay for 6 years. 

If Trump means ""merit-based"" to mean the same types of people that come over on H-1B visas (e.g. computer programmers), then these immigrants will be given a path to citizenship, rather than just a 6 year work permit.

This paper goes into the effects of H-1B workers on the economy:

https://www.nber.org/papers/w23153

Basically, it says that wages are decreased, but productivity and corporate profits are increased. 

>In the absence of immigration, wages for US computer scientists would have been 2.6% to 5.1% higher and employment in computer science for US workers would have been 6.1% to 10.8% higher in 2001. On the other hand, complements in production benefited substantially from immigration, and immigration also lowered prices and raised the output of IT goods by between 1.9% and 2.5%, thus benefiting consumers. Finally, firms in the IT sector also earned substantially higher profits due to immigration.

So I would expect this move to put downward pressure on middle-class wages even further, since the workers will be here permanently.

,"[This article from PRI](https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-05-17/can-merit-based-immigration-system-modeled-canada-or-australia-work-us) brings up a lot of great angles.

For the pros side, it's undeniably a plus for the US economy. Having more high-skilled workers to fill high-paying jobs means more wealthy people in the country. Granted, this adds greater competition to areas that are already have the most competitive jobs in the country, but it's very location-specific (see: Silicon Valley and a handful of other cities). If more states were to follow Texas' example of being more inclusive of tech employees, we may see less centralized competition, but I don't think we're seeing that trend happening.

Among the cons that the article brings up, most are surprisingly procedural:

* Overhauling an entire immigration process, like with any government reform, is costly and confusing. And a successful new system requires fixing a LOT of existing problems with the current system before moving to a new one.

* The linked article points out that merit-based immigration systems require flexibility, and constant adjustment of point adjudication. This is more easily done with the centralized parliaments of Canada and Australia (which the POTUS compares this plan to), but much harder with Congress.

Lastly: it's definitely a con to immigrant families. I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that this policy seeks to reduce immigration for those who come to the US with the intention of financially supporting family abroad and/or eventually bringing them into the US.",GameboyPATH,,bu1p7i,ep6lzq5
,"There's a key assumption lurking at the edges I want to tackle: family based and economic immigration are not zero-sum alternatives.

[One common comparison](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/may/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-international-comparison-merit-based/) given by the Trump administration is to peer countries like Canada, which admit much larger percentages of immigrants on skill-based visas.  This is true in percentage terms, but not as accurate in raw number terms.  


In 2017 Canada admitted [159,262 economic immigrants, 82,470 family immigrants, and 44,747 refugees.](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/pub/annual-report-2018.pdf) (PDF, p. 12) The total immigrant number of 286,479 is about 0.78% of [Canada's 2017 population of 36,540,286.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000501)  Family based visas were in proportion **0.23%** of the total baseline population of Canada.

For the same year in the US, [678,978 people got family-based permanent residency in the US.](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2017/table6) (Sum of ""immediate relative"" and ""family sponsored"" categories).  This is out of a total of 1,051,031 total permanent residencies.  The 678,978 immigrants represents **0.21%** of the total US population of [326,971,407.](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/new-years-2018.html)  But total immigration only represents 0.32% of the population.

Since that was kinda dense, I did it as a table.

| Country | Baseline population | Total immigrants (raw)  | Total immigrants (% pop) | Family immigrants (raw) | Family immigrants (% pop) |
:|-----------|-------------|------------------:|---------------|-----------------|
| Canada |36,540,286 | 286,479 | 0.78% | 82,470 | 0.23% |
| United States | 326,971,407 | 1,051,031 | 0.32% | 678,978 | 0.21% |



The upshot of this is that Canada is not shifting family visas to economic visas, but rather keeping a lot of family visas while also adding a lot of economic visas on top.

The shift the White House proposes would be drastically different from Canada's system, because it would [reduce family reunification](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/trump-immigration-plan-lopsided-proposal) to be much more restrictive than the US or Canada are now, by eliminating visas for parents of US citizens, adult children of US citizens, siblings of US citizens, and children of non-citizen green card holders.

If the US wanted to adopt a Canadian style system, it could be done without any material reduction in family visas.  You just need to add on more work based visas, and have higher total immigration.  That policy difference is [why Canada has been growing at about twice the rate of the United States.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-215-x/2018001/sec1-eng.htm)",huadpe,,bu1p7i,ep6ppb4
,">About 70 percent of immigrants who come to the United States today are admitted based on family relationships or through a random visa lottery—a system that favors random chance over the skills our economy needs.

Let's talk about this part because it's what Trump and his team have focused on arguably the most: family-based immigration, or chain immigration as they'd call it. [I'm taking basically everything from here](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-family-based-immigration/), so feel free to add on more sources. First, I think there's some misconceptions in general in how long it takes to sponsor family members and for them to actually ""follow you"". It's a long process, over years to decades, and the groups actually eligible are pretty limited.

>Immediate relatives: 1) spouses of U.S. citizens; 2) unmarried children under 21 of U.S. citizens; 3) orphans adopted abroad, 4) orphans to be adopted in the U.S., by U.S. citizens; and 5) parents of U.S. citizens who are at least 21 years old.

>Family preference categories: 1) unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, their spouses and their children; 2) spouses, minor children and unmarried sons and daughters over 21 of LPRs; 3) married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens and their spouses and minor children and 4) brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, and their spouses and minor children, provided the U.S. citizens are at least 21 years old.

You're also not really seeing ""chains"" of people. People underestimate how long the waitlist really is.

>n 2017, of the approximately 4.7 million applicants in the family preference categories, more than 3.9 million were on the waiting list, and USCIS was processing the rest

Now let's talk about this part here: skills our economy needs. That's an interesting argument; does family based immigration lead to less skilled workers? 

Well, it's not wrong to say that family based immigrants tend to have lower entry level wages, but [they have higher earnings growth than employment based immigrants](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/advantages-family-based-immigration). 48% of family based immigrants have a bachelors or higher, compared to 33% of adults in the US overall. That's important to note too, considering there seems to be some misconceptions on what family based immigrants actually look like.

So what does this mean for a focus on merit based immigration? Well, that it's essentially trying to answer a problem that doesn't exist, and that it ignores the relative success of family based immigrants. The immigration system is flawed, but the answer isn't to focus on ""skills.""

>President Trump wants to expedite relief for legitimate asylum seekers—and send those who abuse the system home promptly.

This part I think should raise some questions: namely, what's the level of abuse and what does legitimate asylum seeker mean? Here's Politifact on that:

>About 20 to 30 percent of asylum requests have been granted annually since 2009, but experts said that does not mean the remaining 70 to 80 percent of cases are invalid.

Which, when you look at the waitlist for even normal immigration, makes sense. The system is backlogged. Discussion of asylums seekers abusing the system seems to ignore the more obvious reality: the system is failing asylum seekers and not processing cases fast enough.

I don't think you can make a good case for Trump's vision of immigration to the US. It's not addressing the actual problems with the system; rather, it's clearly targeting some misconceptions held by certain political groups. Family-based immigration is successful and helpful for immigrants to integrate and invest into their community. The asylum system's problems are not with false seekers but with an inability to address cases timely and with the proper care.",Thonyfst,,bu1p7i,ep6kzv6
,"[DACA](https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca) as well as the various flavors of the [dream act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act#For_conditional_resident_status) are the closest thing we've had to ""merit based"" policy.

Essentially you had to have had a clean record, high school diploma (or equivalent), and/or be in college or working towards a trade or military. On top of it, DACA was made specifically for ""kids"", so there was an age bracket.

Benefits? Some sources show that [DACA recepients did pretty well financially](https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release/2018/08/15/454807/release-daca-recipients-growing-economic-educational-gains-stake-daca-faces-serious-threat-yet). Kind of makes sense; you allow young adults in their prime to step out of the shadows and get ""real"" jobs instead of working under the table, wages and benefits are going to go through the roof compared to getting paid less than minimum wage under the table. Additionally, things like [AB 540](http://ab540.com) allowed illegal immigrants to attend college while paying as residents, so many of them also had college degrees to take advantage of in getting new jobs.

The difference is that DACA recepients were *already here*, and more often than not already culturally-acclimated. They didn't have to compete with other immigrants for a limited number of visas. 

Downsides? How do you objectively define ""merit""? Like I mentioned, DACA had a relatively low bar, but at least it had one.

Part of the proposal is to shift the existing numbers around to increase merit (H1) and decrease family numbers. The issues are that most of the time it's going to be large companies that benefit. There are some conflicting [sources](https://www.nnuimmigration.com/h1b-visa-cost), but the jist of it is that it can cost $4,000-$8,000 to process an H1 visa, on top of having all the right paperwork to avoid getting in trouble (proving that no one in the states can do the job you're asking for), which is an entire different debate whether or not employers are already abusing the existing system and the new proposal wants to give them a bigger pool to do it on. Then there are [some companies that abuse it entirely](https://qz.com/india/1268241/h-1b-visa-abuse-a-california-company-promised-its-foreign-workers-8000-and-paid-them-800). Employees are also ""tied"" to the sponsoring company and can't hunt around for new employment without making the new company jump through some hoops to transfer the visa. Not impossible, but it's an additional expense and time sink to get a new hire compared to nothing additional when hiring a ""local"".

,"TL;DR: The US officially abandoned the deal a year ago. Iran remained in compliance, but has recently threatened to pull out of certain provisions.

----------

It's a bit complicated. First, you have to understand that the [JCPOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) (a.k.a. ""the Iran Nuclear deal"") was a 2015 agreement between Iran on one side and six other countries on the other, one of which was the US.

> Under JCPOA, Iran agreed to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its gas centrifuges for 13 years. For the next 15 years Iran will only enrich uranium up to 3.67%. Iran also agreed not to build any new heavy-water facilities for the same period of time. Uranium-enrichment activities will be limited to a single facility using first-generation centrifuges for 10 years. Other facilities will be converted to avoid proliferation risks. To monitor and verify Iran's compliance with the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities. The agreement provides that in return for verifiably abiding by its commitments, Iran will receive relief from U.S., European Union, and United Nations Security Council nuclear-related sanctions.

Without getting too deep into the details of fissile material, the goal was to significantly increase Iran's ""breakout time,"" the time needed for them to enrich enough uranium to potentially build a nuclear weapon. Iran has never built a nuclear weapon and claims it has no intentions of doing so, but their enrichment regime prior to the deal calls that into question.

In May of 2018, despite the urging of the other parties, President Trump [pulled the US out of the deal,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44045957) simultaneously saying he would reimpose the sanctions on Iran that the JCPOA was designed to relieve. The other five partner countries remained committed to deal.

However, part of the renewed US sanctions was restrictions on transfers via US banks, which would affect the efforts of any other countries to do business with Iran. The other parties to the deal, most notably the Europeans, have started to set up an [alternate payment channel to Iran in order to get around those US banking sanctions.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-02/iran-europe-sidesteps-the-u-s-finance-system-with-instex) The US responded by [threatening to cancel waivers that had allowed a few countries to continue buying Iranian oil and cooperate on nuclear energy technology.](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-vows-to-uphold-iran-nuclear-deal-as-trump-raises-pressure/) This has stoked considerable [tensions between the US and its European partners.](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article229117794.html) If the US sanctions Europe over its continued dealings with Iran, the Europeans will have little choice but to back down.

Meanwhile, the Iranians have watched as much of the sanctions relief they got under the deal has evaporated and there's a good chance the whole deal will fall apart if the Europeans can't persuade the Trump administration to take a more measured approach. Although the Iranians have remained in compliance for the year since the US pulled out, they have now [threatened to stop complying with two provisions of the deal: the cap on their stockpile of enriched uranium and heavy water.](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/08/721552448/iran-threatens-to-stop-complying-with-2-provisions-in-nuclear-deal) They haven't actually stopped complying with those two provisions, nor have they threatened to pull out of the deal completely, but they've said they're not getting the sanctions relief they were promised, so they may take these steps. Here it's useful to remember the domestic politics of Iran, because Iranian opponents of the deal are saying the economic benefits that were promised to Iran are not materializing, so what's the point of unilaterally implementing this deal? Meanwhile, Trump has threatened more sanctions.

So, that's where we are right now with respect to the deal. The US officially pulled out and reimposed sanctions a little more than a year ago and the Iranians have not responded until this recent threat to potentially stop implementing two of the deal's provisions. That's what your first source is referring to.

,"Assange is being charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, this act was also used to prosecute (unsuccessfully) Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo for the Pentagon Papers. A 2015 study by the PEN American Center found that almost all of the non-government representatives they interviewed, including activists, lawyers, journalists and whistleblowers, ""thought the Espionage Act had been used inappropriately in leak cases that have a public interest component."" PEN wrote, ""experts described it as 'too blunt an instrument,' 'aggressive, broad and suppressive,' a 'tool of intimidation,' 'chilling of free speech,' and a 'poor vehicle for prosecuting leakers and whistleblowers.

There is an unsealed affidavit, which is dated December 21, 2017, from the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5911143-Julian-Assange-Affidavit-December-2017.html

The document contains details on the interactions between Assange and Manning. And, most significantly, contains the admission that the US government—as of December of 2017—had no idea whether Assange actually cracked the password. Until now, we knew that the US was aware that Assange attempted to crack a password for Manning once, but didn't know if it had more evidence of further attempts or whether it thought Assange was successful.

“Investigators have not recovered a response by Manning to Assange’s question, and there is no other evidence as to what Assange did, if anything, with respect to the password,”

,"Although The American President has [campaigned for a wall during and is causing a shutdown over getting budgets for it](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/8/18171913/shutdown-trump-speech-wall-funding), there currently doesn't seem to be any plans for how it will be done.

Considering the presidency is the executive branch, while the physical building of the walls can be sub-contracted out to other entities, major policies regarding the wall still has to be signed and executed, and before that, a decision made; and before that, questions answered.  America is not the president's private backyard, so you can't just have some people move in and start stacking bricks at whatever location.

Here're a few example questions:

**On how the physical wall will be built**

* Where will the wall be built?  The ""border"" is not a good enough answer.  There are a lot of nuances when building at the border.  Simply ""on which side"" of the border is going to give us a lot of things to argue about, and we're not even getting onto details like ""how far away""

* What will it consist of?  The president has a tendency to fudge definitions a lot.  In his earlier campaign he has campaigned for a concrete, solid wall, and absolutely not a steel fence that the US currently has; but later on he has moved the definition and is calling his border fence renovation project building a wall.  When definitions fluctuate so much, such a simple question becomes...questionable.

* How much will it cost, is there a budget outline?  Government contract is not like painting your house's walls.  You can't do it half way, realize there's not enough paint, and run down to the store next street for more materials.  

* How much will it cost to maintain?  Like all physical constructs, unless properly maintained, it will just fall apart, either from wear and tear, or simply environmental damage.  The Chinese government constantly have to allocate budget for the [maintenance of their Great Wall](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201712/19/WS5a38c9f3a3108bc8c6735c6b.html).  American walls are no exception to the laws of physics.

* How will the government gain access/ownership of the border land?  A lot of the lands at the border are not federally owned.  While you can simply yell ""eminent domain!"", it's not as simple as a tyrant confiscating the land and kicking people out with no consequences. The questions of how the presidency plan to navigate the upcoming headaches, is a part of the concern. (more on these later)

**On impact of the wall**

While it is easy to gain popular support from people with a slogan, the most critical people who are involved are not so emotionally driven.  Solid metrics are often needed to convince those people unless the president plan to bribe everyone and anyone involved in the decision making process.

   * How many people are entering through the southern border each year?

   * And how many people will the wall prevent by, say 5 years, after completion?

   * How will the government assess success/failure?

**some, perhaps more complicated questions, that are equally critical**

* Much of the land along the border is privately held, will the government seek to use eminent domain to seize this land?

   * How many private owners are there?

   * have they been identified?

   * what is the estimated cost of the disbursements

   * how many years does the government expect it will take to complete the lawsuits?

* [The area with the highest number of crossings is the Rio Grande valley](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683662691/where-does-illegal-immigration-mostly-occur-heres-what-the-data-tell-us).  Does the government intend to wall off the Rio Grande and *de facto* cede it to Mexico?

 * If not, does the government actually expect the wall to have *any* impact?

   * What is the governments plan when the valley floods (it is a flood plain and floods regularly)

* [Part of the border includes tribal land - which extends into Mexico.](https://www.usatoday.com/border-wall/story/tohono-oodham-nation-arizona-tribe/582487001/) They have made it clear they will not allow the wall, does the government even have a plan of approach as to how they might seize/claim the

,"From what my constitutional law class drilled into me last semester, the dissenting opinions in Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey accept that a constitutional right to privacy exists (Griswold v Connecticut) but reject that abortion should be a part of that right.

The huge issue here is what is called ""levels of scrutiny."" If abortion is a constitutionally protected right via the right to privacy, it is considered a **fundamental** right and any law seeking to restrict a fundamental right will receive *strict scrutiny* by the court. This means there is an inherent presumption the law is unconstitutional and only an extremely compelling state interest would be sufficient to defeat that presumption.

What the dissenting justices in Roe/PP wanted was for abortion to be considered an average **social** right. Social rights are only subject to the *rational basis* level of scrutiny, meaning that any plausible government interest is sufficient to prove its constitutionality. If Roe v Wade is completely overturned, abortion will become a social right and the government could outlaw it completely with very little judicial resistance.  

What complicates abortion rights under Roe v Wade and PP v Casey, is that strict scrutiny only successfully applies to abortions **before viability**. After viability, the court held the government has a sufficient interest to protect the life of the fetus and can completely outlaw abortion at that point. Some con law scholars believe this a totally separate category from strict scrutiny, others think differently.

A challenge to Roe v Wade, as presented by the heartbeat bills or Alabama's complete abolition, will likely argue either that 1) abortion is not part of the right to privacy or 2) that the government's compelling interest in protecting the fetus exists well before viability. The second one seems more likely to succeed, however I am likely looking at a C+ in con law so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. 

The good news is that when deciding to directly overturn a case, the supreme court will probably assess how many people currently rely on the current law and how conceptions of sex/contraception have been shaped as a result. If you any of you have interests in supreme court cases, I highly recommend a site called Oyez. It's a fantastic resource. I'm linking the cases below.

,"A lot of people are correctly pointing out that the ruling of Roe v. Wade is not directly enshrined in the Constitution, which makes its foundation shaky. This is true, but I want to talk about the long path we took to get to Roe v. Wade.

When the Constitution was first written, it was only meant to be a limitation on the national government. That's why the Bill of Rights was contentious: [Federalists argued that Congress was given no right to, say, limit free speech, so why did we need a specific line prohibiting it?](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/) But it placated the Anti-Federalists, so in it went.

After the 14th amendment was passed, suddenly, [under the due process clause of the 14th, we started accepting the Bill of Rights as applying to the states as well](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/incorporation_doctrine). We're pretty used to this now, but it's actually a fairly radical departure from the Constitution, because the Bill of Rights specifically says *Congress* shall make no law, not that freedom of speech is a protected right.

Ever since then, we've accepted that the 14th amendment protects certain fundamental rights by its due process clause; the question to dissenting justices in [Lawrence v. Texas](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/558/#tab-opinion-1961304) (homosexual sodomy laws) was not whether the Constitution protected fundamental rights but whether ""homosexual sodomy"" was a fundamental right. Similarly, in  [Obergefell v. Hodges](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-556/#tab-opinion-3427254) (gay marriage), no justice challenged marriage as a fundamental right, merely arguing that marriage had to be between a man and a woman. Where is the right to marry in the Constitution? Justices explicitly discover it, not there, but by looking through history and historic laws. We seem to be pretty happy with this, whether or not we think gay marriage is fundamental.

[Griswold v. Connecticut](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/381/479/#tab-opinion-1945662), which is where the right to privacy was initially established, also looks to the due process clause, and a bunch of other clauses, to find that ""implicit right to privacy"". I think Griswold is where it gets shaky, actually, (specifically where right to marital privacy implies contraceptives can't be banned), but that's not what's being argued.

We finally come to the question, was Roe v. Wade decided correctly? [Roe v. Wade](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/), if you read the opinion in the context of all these years of incorporation, didn't really depart from precedent. The right to marital privacy comes from Griswold, so that's stare decisis, and when weighing the rights of the mother against the state interest in the fetus, they do what we did when finding a right to marriage: they turn to historical laws and writings. That's why Roe's abortion limits don't line up that well with modern medical consensus---they're based on 17th century texts talking about ""quickening"". In fact, Roe v. Wade basically calls anti-abortion laws a modern fad:  ""It perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage"". Depending on how you think the Constitution should be interpreted, you might think this is irrelevant.

So is Roe v. Wade shaky? Absolutely. It relies heavily on a line of extra-Constitutional reasoning that's really, if you think about it, a bit of a departure. But Roe v. Wade didn't invent this reasoning. There's a long judicial tradition of using the 14th amendment in this way, and at this point it's accepted. If you think that's wrong, there are a lot of cases you want to argue. And if you just think there isn't a fundamental right to privacy, well, we still need to revisit Griswold and all its progeny.

TL;DR -

Weaknesses of Roe v. Wade's foundation: The Constitution definitely does not explicitly protect privacy, and we only discover it in a combination of the [1st, 4th, 5th, 9th, and 14th amendments](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/). Also, Roe v. Wade explicitly acknowledges the state's interest in protecting the fetus, it just decides it isn't that strong in the early stages, giving a judicial answer to what is really better off as a medical or religious question.

Strengths of Roe v. Wade's foundation: Roe v. Wade itself isn't a departure from precedent. It's following a long tradition of using the amendments in this way, and builds on a not-insignificant amount of historical research. Justice Blackmun didn't pull it out of thin air.",thefrozenbee,,bq8zzi,eo2ihs2
,"There is nothing novel in the notion that a primary right implicates a secondary or peripheral right.  Blackstone kicks off his [Commentaries of the Laws of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England) with a discussion of the [Absolute Rights of Individuals.](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp). He identifies three absolute rights: personal security, a person's ""enjoyment of a his life, his limbs, his body, his health, and his reputation,"" personal liberty, the ""power of loco-motion, of changing situation, or removing one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct ; without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of law,"" and property, ""the free use, enjoyment, and disposal of all his acquisitions, without any control or diminution, save only by the laws of the land"". He then points out:

>""But in vain would these rights be declared, ascertained, and protected by the dead letter of the laws, if the constitution had provided no other method to secure their actual enjoyment. It has therefore established certain other auxiliary subordinate rights of the subject, which serve principally as barriers to protect and maintain inviolate the three great and primary rights, of personal security, personal liberty, and private property.""

The subordinate rights he identifies are the (1) constitution, powers, and privileges of Parliament, (2) the executive being constrained by law, (3) being able to seek redress in the courts, (4) failing that, being able to seek redress from the executive or parliament, and (5) the right to bear arms.  So, again, the idea that certain rights implicate other rights isn't novel.

When it comes to the U.S. Constitution, SCOTUS has applied a similar logic to the enumerated rights, those explicitly listed, and found auxiliary rights to be implied. Sometimes this is just common sense.  For instance, [Justice Douglas in *Griswold v. Connecticut*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12276922145000050979&q=griswold+v+connecticut&hl=en&as_sdt=2006) wrote ""The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to teach —indeed the freedom of the entire university community.""  It requires little thought to come around to the idea that freedom of speech doesn't mean free to speak in an empty room or that freedom of the press doesn't mean you can print it but cannot let anyone read it. One right entails the others.

*Roe* relies on the work done in a number of cases such as *Griswold.* *Griswold* dealt with a married couple who sought advice from a doctor and two Connecticut laws:

>""Any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception shall be fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned;""

and...

>""Any person who assists, abets, counsels, causes, hires or commands another to commit any offense may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.""

Justice Douglas' opinion in *Griswold* saw a law which forbid use of contraceptives as regulating a married couple's private relationship.  *Griswold* describes that relationship as lying within a ""zone of privacy"" and sets out where the Bill of Rights suggests such a right of privacy:

>Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers ""in any house"" in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the ""right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."" The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment... The Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described in Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 630, as protection against all governmental invasions 'of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.'""

So, the much maligned notion in *Roe* of penumbras and emanations comes from *Griswold,* ""... specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.""  This is just another way to say ""Without those peripheral rights the specific rights would be less secure.""  What is interesting, however, is how *Griswold* ends, ""We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than our school system.""  That makes it sound like Justice Douglas views the enumerated rights as explicitly written down ""emanations"" and ""penumbras"" to a right to privacy, instead of the other way around.  Ultimately, whether proceeding or derived from those constitutionally enumerated rights, you need to take a stance on whether rights depend on and implicate others to be secure and whether a right to privacy is one of those before you think about *Roe.* 

[*Roe* concluded that the right of privacy found in prior cases such as *Griswold* shields the ""abortion decision:""](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673&q=roe+v.+wade&hl=en&as_sdt=2006)

>This right of privacy... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.

*Roe* didn't take a hard stance on the decision being beyond important state interests in regulations.  You can go about balancing the decision against other interests or do that differently than in *Roe* such as in [Planned Parenthood v. Casey.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&q=casey+v.+planned+parenthood&hl=en&as_sdt=2006) To believe in *Roe's* logic, you do have to ask yourself whether you think the decision to have a child is foremost a personal, private decision and whether that is the kind personal, private decisions protected by a right to privacy like use of contraceptives.  You first figure out whether deciding to have a child is a private matter before considering what other interests you might balance it against.  

******

To summarize, the right to privacy is not an enumerated right in the constitution.  It emerges from certain cases as a peripheral right to those rights explicitly written down.  You could see this as a weakness in the argument.  

Even if you do believe the Constitution and Bill of Rights entail a right to privacy, you could read it more narrowly derived from particular rights such as the Fourth Amendments protection against searches and seizures of people's persons, houses, papers, and effects. So, you might believe that the right to privacy only extends so far as to make an enumerated right more secure and, upon considering the privacy implicated by those enumerated rights, it is not broad enough to cover the ""abortion decision.""

I don't know of anyone making the argument that a decision to have a child is not private.  The argument is just usually that other interests, such as those of an unborn child with the state acting on its behalf, override an otherwise private decision.  No one argues the state should decide who has children.  So, that isn't really a weakness of the argument.  If you believe there is a right to privacy and it is construed broadly, a decision to have children falls into that.  The fight would just be on the extent to which the decision is protected and how much it should be regulated.",prime_23571113,,bq8zzi,eo2qubo

,"Man, I don't know why no one's posted anything from the [actual decision](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/):

> Three reasons have been advanced to explain historically the enactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to justify their continued existence.

> It has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas, however, does not advance this justification in the present case, and it appears that no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously. The appellants and amici contend, moreover, that this is not a proper state purpose, at all and suggest that, if it were, the Texas statutes are overbroad in protecting it, since the law fails to distinguish between married and unwed mothers.

> A second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure. When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman. [Footnote 43] This was particularly true prior to the development of antisepsis. Antiseptic techniques, of course, were based on discoveries by Lister, Pasteur, and others first announced in 1867, but were not generally accepted and employed until about the turn of the century. Abortion mortality was high. Even after 1900, and perhaps until as late as the development of antibiotics in the 1940's, standard modern techniques such as dilation and curettage were not nearly so safe as they are today. Thus, it has been argued that a State's real concern in enacting a criminal abortion law was to protect the pregnant woman, that is, to restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her life in serious jeopardy. Modern medical techniques have altered this situation. Appellants and various amici refer to medical data indicating that abortion in early pregnancy, that is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although not without its risk, is now relatively safe. Mortality rates for women undergoing early abortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be as low as or lower than the rates for normal childbirth. Consequently, any interest of the State in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for her to forgo it, has largely disappeared. Of course, important state interests in the areas of health and medical standards do remain. The State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient. This interest obviously extends at least to the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that might arise. The prevalence of high mortality rates at illegal ""abortion mills"" strengthens, rather than weakens, the State's interest in regulating the conditions under which abortions are performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest in protecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is proposed at a late stage of pregnancy.

> The third reason is the State's interest -- some phrase it in terms of duty -- in protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument for this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from the moment of conception. The State's interest and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal life. Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course, a legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other point prior to live birth. In assessing the State's interest, recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at least potential life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone.

> Parties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life. Pointing to the absence of legislative history to support the contention, they claim that most state laws were designed solely to protect the woman. Because medical advances have lessened this concern, at least with respect to abortion in early pregnancy, they argue that with respect to such abortions the laws can no longer be justified by any state interest. There is some scholarly support for this view of original purpose. The few state courts called upon to interpret their laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did focus on the State's interest in protecting the woman's health, rather than in preserving the embryo and fetus. Proponents of this view point out that in many States, including Texas, by statute or judicial interpretation, the pregnant woman herself could not be prosecuted for self-abortion or for cooperating in an abortion performed upon her by another. They claim that adoption of the ""quickening"" distinction through received common law and state statutes tacitly recognizes the greater health hazards inherent in late abortion and impliedly repudiates the theory that life begins at conception.

> It is with these interests, and the eight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned.

> ...This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.

> On the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some amici argue that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. With this we do not agree. Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive. The Court's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. As noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some amici that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11 (1905) (vaccination); Buck v. Bell, 274 U. S. 200 (1927) ( sterilization).

> We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.

Let's start there, shall we?",Darsint,,bq8zzi,eo2oivd
,"So, to simply explain for a layperson: Under Roe v Wade, the right to abortion is found in the ""penumbra"" of the Constitution. ""Penumbra"" is a word meaning ""the edges of a shadow"". 

Basically, the idea is that, while there's no explicit right to abortion spelled out in the Constitution, if you take all the rights in the Constitution and pile them on top of each other, this pile begins to glow from the combination, and this glow casts a shadow, and in this shadow are rights that you previously could not see but are there and are included with the rights that are explicitly spelled out. 

In other words, it's a way to ""find"" whatever rights you want in the Constitution, pretty much just made up out of thin air because you want them to be there. I'm pro-choice, and even I think this whole structure behind Roe v Wade is basically built on sand.

It's why so many Constitutional scholars from both sides talk about the unsteady reasoning of the decision, and in fact it's why it's been so vulnerable to attacks for so long, unlike other Supreme Court decisions that are just left alone. You can even see it in Planned Parenthood's defense of the decision, relying on a ""stare decisis"" argument (which basically says it's been around for a long time, so just leave it alone), rather than the specific legal merits of the decision itself.

Here's an analysis of all this from the Washington Post in 1992, when Roe v Wade came back under Supreme Court review: https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1992/12/20/privacy-penumbra-and-emanations/9a60c07c-4e98-4ffe-8b53-95fba222012a/",EnderHarris,,bq8zzi,eo2besg

,"I think there is some confusion about the judiciary's role vs the legislature's role, particularly the federal judiciary's role with respect to a state legislature.  The courts don't act as the clearinghouse for what laws pass muster and should go into effect - legislatures have the exclusive right to make laws (and repeal or amend them).  Instead, the courts' role is to say how those laws are interpreted and whether they conflict with other laws or a state or federal constitution.  If a state law is challenged in federal court on the grounds that it violates the U.S. constitution, then the federal court could declare that it is unconstitutional and enter an injunction preventing the enforcement of the law.  The unconstitutional law would still go into effect and be ""on the books"" (i.e. a court never ""strikes"" a law), but it just couldn't legally be enforced.  [source](https://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2019/05/getting-the-nomenclature-right.html)  

So if a state passes a law that is declared unconstitutional, even if it disagrees with the ruling it would be odd for the legislature to pass the exact same law again.  It could just leave the original law on the books and hope that a higher court disagrees with the court that declared the law unconstitutional or a constitutional amendment is passed.  There would never be a need or point (as far as I could foresee) to pass the same law twice.

Edit to add:  Regarding your point about a state overwhelming the courts by passing an unconstitutional law over and over again, I don't know if legislatures could ever operate so quickly to trick the judiciary like that.  But in any event, a federal court could enter a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of the state laws until it can make a final resolution.  This would likely deal with any surprise enactment of a law.  To get a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff would need to show a likelihood of success on the merits, but once a law is declared unconstitutional the first time that showing would be very easy in any subsequent cases.

,">Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.

Yes, this is the crux of the issue. The guilty verdict is often part of a plea deal, and they very likely could've been found guilty had the agreement not been made.

But if you do not expunge the record of a violent trafficker who only plead to possession, you'd effectively be punishing someone for a crime they were not convicted of, and thus policies like that will likely result in many costly challenges in court... or could risk pardoning a violent drug dealer.

In Canada we just recently had this discussion and [the decision was ultimately to provide a free option to be pardoned of any possession-only charges](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cannabis-pot-pardons-blair-goodale-1.5038887).

We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs?

,"I have an argument against expunging convictions due to change in law (not specifically marijuana). 

When cases are dismissed due to absence of law e.g. Lack of Jurisdiction ( https://definitions.uslegal.com/l/lack-of-jurisdiction/ ), the person cannot be again tried in court if there's a change in law giving jurisdiction to court at a later date. 

Similarly, if person has broken a law, why should they be released when the law has changed at a later date? The fact remains that they have committed a crime. The sentences can be reduced or leniency can be shown in good faith.",movie_addict97,,bomcl1,eni8n7p

So the million dollar question is, what constitutes ""best efforts""? Ideally, there would be human moderators checking uploaded content against copyrighted works. In practice though, this is absolutely unfeasible.  Taking YouTube as an example, over 300 hours of content are uploaded *every minute* ([Source](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/youtube-statistics/)).  The only reasonable method of checking all of this content is some kind of automated system.  Many large sites already have systems like this in place (i.e., YouTube's ContentID).

To the EU's credit, they have outlined some exceptions: ""quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"" are safe from regulation ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47708144)).  Of course, how is an automated system supposed to tell the difference between infringement and quotation, or copying and reviewing?  This is one of the main current fears behind the legislation.

Concerning your last question, the EU's proposal does not outline any means of enacting this proposal, meaning it's difficult to guess how implementing it will affect citizens.  It depends entirely on how the implementation is handled by sites and member nations themselves.

Summary edit:  Does the EU law force the adoption of automated content filters?  Technically no (the law doesn't say anything about content filters explicitly) but functionally yes (automated systems are the only realistic way to handle the immense amount of content being handled by large tech companies).",NumbersWithFriends,,bnbq0x,en4phgq

DoJ was subpoenaed in May 2011 for FnF documents.

Chuck Grassley sent Attorney General Holder a letter requesting details about Operation Fast and Furious, which had been a failed federal firearms sting operation, which had allowed some 2,000 weapons to reach Mexican drug gangs. Grassley and Issa urged Holder to cooperate and turn over subpoenaed records that would reveal the scope of the alleged government coverup.

DoJ provided 7600 pages of documents by October 2011. House Oversight Committee chairman, California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa argued that the documents contradicted AG Holder's previous testimony.

April 2012 the House Oversight Committee threatened to hold AG Holder in contempt.

Congress has something called ""Inherent Contempt"", which allows the Sergeant at Arms to arrest and detain anyone in contempt, and the chamber can pass a sentence of imprisonment. The last time this was used was 1934. This power resides solely with Congress. 

Since the mid 1800s, Congress has predominantly used what is called ""Statutory Contempt"". They pass a resolution holding someone in contempt, and refer criminal contempt charges to the US Attorney for the District of Columbia. The US Attorney will then decide to prosecute criminal contempt charges or not. If the person in contempt is the Attorney General, then the US attorney can request the Deputy AG appoint a special counsel to investigate and prosecute the AG. 

The third option for someone ignoring a subpoena from Congress is to sue them in federal court and get an order to comply with said subpoena. If the person ignores the court order, then the judge can hold them in contempt of court and detain them until they comply with the order.

,"The report is definitely a legal document, but Mueller's team also wrote it intending for it to be released to the public. Thus, since the report has political implications, there are inherently some parts that could be read in a political light.

For instance, Mueller's decision to include multiple references to [Congress' constitutional role in holding the president accountable](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/04/mueller-leaves-it-to-congress-to-decide-whether-trump-obstructed-justice/) for his actions raises political implications.

,"It’s hard to prove a negative, such as the lack of any statements that could be seen by some as political in a 400 page report. 

That being said, what I read of the report seemed to be laser focused, and I would argue that he was not overstepping his mandate. The most obvious and central example of this is muellers definition of “collusion” and how that specific term is not a “legal term of art” and therefore he was guided by the definition of “criminal conspiracy” to reach his conclusions. If this report was a political document then it would be easy to show that trumps team welcomed foreign interference, provided polling data, took meetings with Russians offering dirt, had contact with Wikileaks, etc. and that there was some evidence of “collusion.” But mueller was following the law so closely that he applied the very rigorous criminal burden of proof, and was very careful to not alledge wrongdoing if not charging crimes, even when its pretty obvious there were a lot of acts that could count as “wrongdoing.”

As for the obstruction portion of the report, the same idea is true. There was tons of evidence of wrongdoing, but mueller was strictly abiding by the OLC guideline to not indict a sitting president. In light of that he basically abandoned his task on that point because he didn’t want to potentially preempt constitutional remedies for “presidential misconduct.” Again, if this was a political document he could have easily concluded that trump committed criminal obstruction, and stated that while he couldn’t indict, that congress should impeach. Instead he stuck to the very specific task of investigating the election interference and making prosecution decisions (when he felt like he could).

One last point is how quiet mueller and his team have been throughout this whole investigation. Basically no public statements, no interviews, no press releases, no leaks. That is a little separate from the contents of the report, but is some insight into the nature of the investigation and how they could have done a lot to politicize the findings, but were very careful not to.",karkovice1,,bkd0p5,emgvbrn

>Anti-gun treaty proponents continue to mislead the public, claiming the treaty would have no impact on American gun owners. This is a bald-faced lie. For example, the most recent draft treaty includes export/import controls that would require officials in an importing country to collect information on the ""end user"" of a firearm, keep the information for 20 years, and provide the information to the country from which the gun was exported. In other words, if you bought a Beretta Shotgun, you would be an ""end user"" and the U.S. government would have to keep a record of you and notify the Italian government about your purchase. That is gun registration. If the U.S. refuses to implement this data collection on law-abiding American gun owners, other nations might be required to ban the export of firearms to the U.S.

Keep in mind that this is from the perspective of a group who believes their political opponents will use any tool available to curtail gun ownership. There are some recent examples of how international treaties could affect civilian gun ownership, and potentially validate the NRA's concerns.

1. ITAR laws being applied to local gunsmiths, even if they have never exported anything.

An ABA report argues that the treaty would not place any new restrictions on gun ownership.

>The white paper, issued Feb. 26, asserts that the treaty “would not require new domestic regulations of firearms.

**Overall**

Con: The whole plan is paid for with new taxes. The government spends enough and runs massive deficits. Before creating new programs, fix the current spending problem.

**Loan Forgiveness**

Con:

People knew what they were getting into when they took out the loans, the plan rewards irresponsible borrowing. 

The plan punishes people who borrowed responsibly (by handing out money to people who borrowed irresponsibly).

The plan punishes people (both responsible and irresponsible borrowers) who paid back their loans, and maybe struggled to do so.

How long does someone’s household income need to be under the threshold? One year? Five? Ten? If it’s just a few years, it won’t be hard to defer compensation to remain under the threshold. A lot of families making between $100,000 and $150,000 a year may do this to maximize their benefit.  

**Free education**

Con:

The federal government does not run colleges and universities (except the service academies and educational institutions affiliated with the military like (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences), it’s easy to say public higher education will be free when it is states paying.

If the plan pays for free public higher ed by expanding federal aid, states will raise costs and reduce higher ed spending because they know the federal government will pick up the bill. 

Knowing that the federal government would pick up the bill is one cause of the high cost of higher education. Her plan won’t solve the problem, it will make it worse.

> Experts estimate my debt cancellation plan creates a one-time cost to the government of $640 billion. The Universal Free College program brings the total cost of the program to roughly $1.25 trillion over ten years.

A source on her numbers is needed, but if that number is correct, that means 2-4 years of free college would cost an average of $125 Billion a year from 2020-2030, then cost (1250 - 640) / 10 = **$61 Billion per year** from 2031 onward.

Edit #2: [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/missions/secure-liberty/15) mentions that there is roughly 20 million students enrolled in college.

* $61000 million / 20 million = $3050 per student/year after 2030.

> Private student loan debt is also eligible for cancellation, and the  federal government will work with borrowers and the holders of this debt  to provide relief. 

If one says that now the federal government has a lot of say in universities due to this funding, I would disagree simply based on the large endowments most public universities work with and receiving state funding as well. With this plan government would have even less seeing that the student controls where there funding goes and government would have to allocate funding regardless if the student incurred debt. It would be like the student going on road trip. The car needs gas and the government is the universal gas card. The driver chooses where to stop and the gas station chooses how much to charge. The gas card doesn't get to choose where it is used as long as it's for gas. What do you think is going to happen? Given our country's market system, the gas station and in turn the university will justify raising the price especially given that everyone will pay with the gas car or straight cash if they are rich enough.  That gas card is footing the bill and eventually the driver or the gas station will test the spending limit. 

One last point. I do like how in this system universities will work harder to either create more room for more students since they know they can pay and in turn may make universities work harder to recruit student making it more competitive for the students to stand out. What I mean is universities would give other perks such as housing priority or program acceptance and beef up there programs and students would in turn would want to go where they are wanted not just on what they can afford.",NottagameNottagame,,bg9nsw,eljz3mw

Another nitpick people has is that it is unfair to people who were prudent and either didn't take loans or paid off their loans. Those people have a point and I feel them, but they miss the big picture. There has never been a government program that's 100% completely fair and equitable to every person in every circumstance. But that's not a reason not to do it.

That also doesn't take into account the privilege that anyone who can pay for college outright or can pay off their student debt has. There was a time where working a full time or even part time job could pay for tuition *and* living expenses but those days are *way long past.* 

Plus, if you're going to make college debt free for future students, as Warren also proposes, it actually *is* fair to eliminate debt for those who still have it. 

Everyone, whether they have debt or not, will benefit from the improved economy that we'll discuss now.

This is a direct, bottom up cash injection, targeted at people who are not rich. It's 100% the opposite of supply-side Reaganomics witch can spark growth but has generally proven to do more harm than good economically and doesn't have the ROI for the tax coffers that is advertised because you've created anemic at best growth and cut taxes, leading to the massive deficits that Republicans are best known for. Rich people don't create jobs with tax cuts, they hoard the money. 

When poor and middle-class people get their hands on government cash, they *spend it,* because they've been putting off buying a house, buying a car, getting car repairs, going to the doctor, whatever. This creates a multiplier effect on the economy, for every dollar the government injects, the economy gets more than one dollar.

It has been well established that the student debt bubble is currently an albatross on the neck of our economy. For one thing, it is a relatively recent phenomenon. Student loans have been around for a long time, but as state funding has been reduced and college costs have been being shifted more toward the student, debt is rising. I've seen numbers showing that student debt has tripled in the past 15 years or so. It's a bubble that *will* burst if left unchecked.

>
>The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.

When many laws are applied to the President, these may run afoul of explicit powers granted to the President by the Constitution. 

A question such as 'Can a President break into an office of the DNC'? For almost every case, the answer is no and there is no Constitutional power granted the President to allow this. In that case, it is likely a President can be indicted. There are lots of cases where crimes do run afoul of the Section 2 powers - such as Obstruction when a president fires a cabinet officer. (this is big in the news right now)

So, lets assume we do have a case free and clear of the Article 2, Section 2 powers. The President *is* bound to follow those laws. A President most likely could be indicted. We know SCOTUS has stated with Bill Clinton that being President did not protect him from the Paula Jones suit.

This is our second sticking point. Can the leader of the Executive branch be put on Trial? I think the answer is no. I believe Congress would first have to impeach/convict the President removing him from office or the term of their Presidency would need to expire. I am also fairly sure if SCOTUS agreed with this logic, any statute of limitations issues would be 'frozen' during the term of the Presidency. If the President is immune from prosecution, then the ticking clocks for prosecution need to stop during this time too. This is ultimately coming back to Separation of Powers issues.

,"This is tricky, because there is a balance that needs to be struck between the democratic accountability of the organs of government, and issues of corruption inherent to someone having the power to supervise and control an investigation of themselves or which may implicate their political interests.

I'll discuss here the Canadian system for dealing with this, with particular reference to the ongoing [SNC-Lavalin scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNC-Lavalin_affair) which shows some of the strengths and limitations of their scheme.

---

Canada's constitutional structure poses a similar challenge to the American structure in that a political appointee has a dual role of both supervising the administration of criminal law, and being the politically and democratically accountable head of one of the departments of government.  

* **The separate roles of Minister of Justice and Attorney General.**

Canadian law is much clearer than American law that [these are dual and separate roles.](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/trans/transition/tab2.html)  Even the title of ""Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada"" separates the roles.  

In her role as Minister of Justice, she is [responsible to](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/responsible-government) the Commons and [to Cabinet](https://lop.parl.ca/About/Parliament/Education/ourcountryourparliament/html_booklet/cabinet-e.html) and must act in accordance with the political and ministerial decisions of the Prime Minister and other cabinet officials.

As Attorney General however she has a distinct role in administering criminal law and providing evenhanded legal advice to the cabinet and to the departments and agencies of the Canadian government.  

In this role, her responsibility is directly to the Crown of Canada, which she represents in court, and suits against, or made by, Canada will be in the Attorney General's name [e.g. this recent Supreme Court opinion in J. W. v. Canada (Attorney General).](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17680/index.do)

* **The establishment and role of the Director of Public Prosecutions.**

In 2006, [there was established within the Ministry of Justice a Director of Public Prosecutions](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-2.5/page-1.html)  The Director is a civil servant, who is charged with deciding whether and when to initiate prosecutions ""in any matter that raises a question of public interest that may affect the conduct of prosecutions or related investigations""

Essentially, in any major or politically sensitive case, the line prosecutors in the Ministry of Justice would have the DPP make a call about what to do.

The Attorney General (as Attorney General, *not* Minister of Justice) [has the power to override the DPP on questions of public interest.](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-2.5/page-2.html#docCont)  The law requires that any instance of such an override must be published in the [Canada Gazette,](http://www.gazette.gc.ca/accueil-home-eng.html) which is the place where the Canadian government publishes laws and regulatory matters.

* **The interaction of the DPP and Attorney General under pressure in the SNC-Lavalin case**

For a few years [the major Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin has been facing corruption and bribery charges.](https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/rmcp-charges-snc-lavalin-with-corruption)

If convicted, SNC [would be barred from federal contracts.](https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/guide-eng.html)  This could drastically impact the company's ability to continue in business.

Under the current Prime Minster, a law was recently enacted to allow for [deferred prosecution agreements,](https://www.osler.com/en/blogs/risk/september-2018/deferred-prosecution-agreements-dpas-come-into-force-in-canada) which would essentially be an order to pay a fine and agree to certain oversight to avoid prosecution.

SNC-Lavalin wanted to obtain a DPA very badly to get rid of the charges they were facing.

* *The DPP denies SNC-Lavalin's request for a deferred prosecution; the PM intervenes with the AG.*

After the DPA law was enacted, the Director of Public Prosecutions considered, and rejected, a request by SNC-Lavalin to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement.  

Following this, Prime Minster Trudeau, directly and through intermediaries, [attempted to](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-committee-documents-audio-1.5077533) have then Attorney General Jody Wilson Raybould to overrule the director of public prosecutions and give SNC the deferred prosecution.

Wilson Raybould indicated to the Prime Minister and staff that the request was unconstitutional since it sought to intervene in her role as Attorney General, as opposed to Minister of Justice, and that in the role of AG she was prohibited from taking in political considerations like job losses.

* *The PM removes the Attorney General.*

Following her refusal (after several months of repeated requests and denials), Wilson Raybould was [involuntarily reassigned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/canadian-political-scandal-deepens-as-ex-justice-minister-testifies-that-trudeaus-office-pressured-her-in-criminal-case/2019/02/27/04587380-3ada-11e9-b10b-f05a22e75865_story.html) to a different cabinet post.  She subsequently resigned from Cabinet, and presented evidence to the Commons justice committee about the Prime Minister's conduct.

The new Attorney General did not overrule the DPP, and SNC-Lavalin is still facing corruption charges, and [is trying to get a court to force the government to give them a deferred prosecution.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-snc-lavalin-revives-court-bid-for-settlement/)

* **What was the effectiveness of the dual AG/MoJ roles, and the existence of the Director of Public Prosecutions?**

I think the system has been fairly effective at preventing undue political interference.  While the ultimate vestiture of power with the elected government means they can (and should) at some level have the power to make decisions over how state power is used, the independent DPP and the express requirement to publish any override did prove effective at preventing backroom dealing to give SNC a break they arguably did not deserve.

The dual-role of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice created quandaries and avenues for backroom dealing.  There is probably a good case for separating the Attorney General and Minister of Justice portfolios, with the Attorney General being an advisor to, but expressly not member of, Cabinet.",huadpe,,bg43jg,elibmbx
,"This is a great topic, and very appropriate in timing!

I feel that this impropriety is much more prevalent in a full Presidential System such as in the US, and is largely a product of unitary executive doctrine.  In Parliamentary and Semi-presidential systems, the Legislature has considerable more influence over individual ministries/departments, which helps to promote their autonomy.  These systems can also generally dissolve the government if need be.

In the Presidential system used in the US, the executive branch is not only entirely autonomous from the legislature, it has also experienced an exclusive centralization of executive authority around a single individual.  This is problematic, as the surest way to prevent the impropriety between chief executive and chief prosecutor is to separate their authority.

The most obvious example of this exists in many of the States, where the state’s Attorney General is elected separately from the Governor, conferring significant independence to the AG as prosecutor.  The Constitution likely prevents the USAG from being directly elected, barring an amendment to that effect.

Another option would be to abolish the concept of federal officials “serving at the pleasure of the President”, meaning that they can be fired at any time.  If Senate confirmation is required for appointment, it could be also required for termination.  Congress attempted to do exactly that with [the Tenure of Office Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure_of_Office_Act_(1867)) , the violation of which is what got Andrew Johnson impeached.  Unfortunately the Act was challenged and declared unconstitutional by SCOTUS.  Were the Tenure of Office Act to be enshrined in a constitutional amendment, however, it would provide the AG (and other secretaries) the autonomy required to avoid impropriety in executive branch investigations. 

Another idea is to simply create an independent investigator answerable to the legislative branch who would handle investigations into the executive branch.  This is essentially what the Independent Counsel was, before its statue was allowed to expire in 1999.  Unfortunately if there is one thing that the two major parties can agree on, it’s that they both prefer to not have their respective administrations bothered by an independent prosecutor who they fear could be politicized.  

Ultimately Congress possesses its own inherent investigative duties, which it routinely uses to supervise the workings of the various government departments, but which it has increasingly become reluctant to use to reign in corruption at the highest level of the executive branch.  Congress constantly attempts to delegate its grievances to other bodies such as the DOJ or the Courts, even while it still maintains in dormancy the inherent contempt authority which it could wield against executive branch officials to forcefully compel compliance in investigative matters.

Lastly, we should not forget about the Grand Juries.  While best known for serving as a citizen body to regulate the issuing of criminal indictments, historically grand juries have also played a major role in investigating government officials for corruption and abuse of power.  It must be remembered that when Special Counsel Mueller indicts someone, it is actually the grand jury that is issuing the indictment.  The grand jury is independent of the prosecutor, and can be considered under the protection of the judicial branch.  Overtime, both at the Federal and State levels, legislatures and AG’s have gradually tamed grand juries into mere extensions of the prosecutors, but their independence and role as “watchers of the watchmen” could always be restored through the demand of the People.

While the US prides itself on the Separation of Powers as a novel mechanism for safeguarding our liberty through competing centers of power, over time those separations have become less meaningful as the Executive seeks to consolidate power around a single person, Congress abdicates its duties to check that power, and the Courts attempt to stay out of it.  All of which leads us to the question asked of this thread...",UnhappySquirrel,,bg43jg,elk2d3n

2. When a felony has been in fact committed and he has reasonable ground to believe that the person to be arrested has committed it.

Illegal immigration is a *misdemeanor*, only if you come back after being deported is it a felony. IANAL but that seems pretty clear cut. Also keep in mind citizen's arrest doesn't exclude you from breaking other laws like owning illegal firearms or brandishing, aka holding people up.

>False imprisonment consists of intentionally confining or restraining another person without his consent and with knowledge that he has no lawful authority to do so.

>Whoever commits false imprisonment is guilty of a fourth degree felony.

There are several New Mexico cases where defendants have been convicted of false imprisonment for holding someone at gunpoint.  E.g. [State v. Moore, 782 P. 2d 91 - NM Court of Appeals (1989)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14226053492117282358&q=False+imprisonment+gunpoint&hl=en&as_sdt=4,32) and [State v.

The [New York Times' description of their conduct](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/new-mexico-militia.html) clearly says that they have been holding at least some of the migrants at gunpoint.

As noted also in the *Bachicha* case, pointing a firearm at another person is a crime of assault in New Mexico.

Note that the crime of false imprisonment is separate from the [New Mexico](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter30/article4/section30-4-1/) and [Federal](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1201) crimes of kidnapping, which require that the person detained be held for ransom, held as a hostage or shield, used for labor, or be killed, sexually assaulted, or physically injured.

I suppose it is possible that the militia members may wrongly believe that they can undertake citizens' arrests, and use that a defense to the knowledge element of the New Mexico law.

[The New Mexico statute does not allow this.](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2013/chapter-31/article-4/section-31-4-14/)  It only allows a citizen's arrest for someone who has already been charged in state court, which would not apply.

As best I can tell, there does not exist any statutory authority for a citizen's arrest for a purely federal offense.

Moreover, the warnings from the police and governor that the conduct is not lawful (as cited in the OP) would be strong evidence against a claim that they thought their conduct lawful.

Also it is worth noting that [entry without inspection is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of 6 months imprisonment.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1325) New Mexico's law, even if it applied to Federal offenses, would not apply to entry without inspection (which is the crime of unlawfully crossing the border) because New Mexico's law requires that the offense be punished by over a year in prison to allow a citizen's arrest.



The precise details of these laws would vary by state, but false imprisonment is one of those ""that's a crime everywhere"" sort of laws.  E.g. [Texas](https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/penal-code/penal-sect-20-02.html), [Arizona](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/01303.htm) and [California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=236.&lawCode=PEN) all have laws banning it, though the precise elements of the offense differ.",huadpe,,bg1h0k,eli0ik4

>Anyone have any source on this? Or understand how they are coming to this line of thinking?

Barr's report only discusses the [principal conclusions](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/436501-barr-tells-congress-doj-in-position-to-release-mueller-report-by-mid) of the investigation. Mueller's full report fills in the evidence that led to those conclusions, and they aren't all very pretty for the President and those around him as even [Republican Senator Mitt Romney](https://twitter.com/SenatorRomney/status/1119322471105216512) has put it. If you didn't read the full report, you wouldn't learn this because such details have nothing to do with the bottom line, so Pelosi and Schumer's statement is accurate.



> What specific statements by Barr as compared to specific quotes from the Mueller report would support or contradict this?

This is a very tricky question to answer and comes down to how one interprets the report and what Barr states on a very literal level. Barr stated at a [Press Conference](https://youtu.be/_X13UvNBBec?t=1123) in response to a Q and A session that he asked Mueller if he would have found a crime but for the OLC opinion, to which he said that Mueller told him to the effect of that he did not say ""but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime"" but rather that he didn't reach a conclusion at all regardless. Volume II Section I of the SC's report explains that the OLC opinion served as a guiding framework for how they approached the investigation, and that regardless of the outcome and what they knew at the start, they would not charge the President with a crime. However, in Volume II page 8 in the conclusion paragraph, there exists the sentence ""The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional prosecutorial judgement."" and similar sentences exist in the various conclusion sections in the report. These sentences sort of create the wiggle room for Barr's statement to be interpreted as accurate, but you need to read into what Barr is saying very literally for that to be true, and they are still in some respect misleading. What Barr is essentially saying is that Mueller didn't come to a conclusion, which is true based on the previous quote, however Mueller didn't come to a conclusion because of the OLC opinion leading him not to make a traditional judgement. What this means is that if you remove the OLC opinion from the equation, Mueller in theory would have been able to now answer the question as to whether a crime occurred, however the current conclusion he would reach before answering that question would not be changed in that he did not come to a conclusion and that it wasn't a sure thing that a crime occurred. So while Barr is saying that Mueller didn't reach a conclusion and that it would be false to say that if the OLC opinion wasn't there, a crime would be there, it's misleading because Mueller only couldn't reach that conclusion one way or the other because of the OLC opinion. I've tried to explain this the best I can, but I apologize if I'm still not doing a good job as it takes a very precise analysis to see where Barr is coming from. As such, it can be argued that Pelosi and Schumer aren't really addressing exactly what Barr said, but what Barr said is so specific and requires such attention that it created the wide space for Pelosi and Schumer to make their point, which is accurate under their assumption, as Barr isn't really being very clear.



>Is it in fact up to Barr to make said decision? Regardless if he shared his opinion? If Barr is not supposed to make this call, who is?

Congress does not have the power to prosecute crimes, but the Executive Branch, and thus the AG, do. Barr was well within his right to come to the conclusions he made as the [one in charge](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.7) of the investigation that Mueller ultimately reports too. If Congress still wishes to investigate and come to their own conclusions after that, they are welcome too, but it wouldn't lead to criminal charges. Mueller's report in Volume II Section I explains how if the President is taking legal actions through his Article II powers that aren't criminal, but can be interpreted as corrupt, then it is more in the field of congress to respond to those actions in such cases.



> I'm at a loss on this one.

If fully cooperates means ""100%"" cooperation, then no the President did not fully cooperate as he never submitted to an interview. However, Pelosi and Schumer's statement that the report ""dramatically"" undercuts Barr's statement is very loaded and arguably impossible to objectively measure what ""dramatically"" means, and Trump did at minimum arguably provide extensive cooperation to the point [some at times worried](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/us/politics/trump-lawyers-white-house-russia-mcgahn-ty-cobb.html) he weakened Presidential power in the face of future investigations. I don't think it's fair to say that firing Comey is an example of not cooperating as Trump was not under investigation at that time (Volume II Section II D) and the SC draws no specific conclusion on Trump's intent in firing Comey, laying evidence on both sides of that aspect. The pressuring senior officials to lie bit is also misleading as none of these instances had to do with Trump suborning perjury (other than maybe Mcgahn, but that's debated in the report in Volume II section II I).



To the overall topic, this is a subject that will result in different opinions based on who you ask, whether you see Barr's letter as a summary vs just the principal conclusions, and how literal you want to get into what Barr said and what was in the report. Pelosi and Schumer's response based on the quotes you provided I would say are mostly accurate and only slightly misleading or addressing topics Barr's principal conclusions was never meant to. In terms of the four overarching points of Barr's letter (the two ways in which Russia meddled in the election, that there was no conspiracy with the Trump campaign or any American with Russia, and that Mueller didn't reach a conclusion on obstruction one way or the other not accusing Trump of a crime but not exonerating him) they are all accurate, but people are taking issue with all the politically damaging things in the report that didn't make it into his letter. It's very easy to google articles and find opinions on what people think is accurate or not about what Barr said, [such as this one](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/apr/18/context-comparing-bill-barrs-summary-mueller-repor/) but how important, relevant, or appropriate they are is up for further debate. I personally would say some are very nit-picky and don't really add any real meaning while others I've seen are just flat out wrong, but there are also those that are undeniably accurate like the claim Trump fully cooperated.",Darkframemaster43,,bf04ee,elbptq7
,"There are a lot of similarities, but one key difference in my view.

**Similarities**

* Both Trump and Nixon seek to use an intermediary to influence an ongoing investigation in a manner they do not think they can get away with doing directly.

 * Nixon's plan is to use the CIA director to contact the FBI deputy director Mark Felt (ironically who [we now know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Throat_(Watergate\)) to be deep throat) and get the FBI to stop looking into the payments that went to the Watergate burglars.^1

 * Trump's plan is to use his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to communicate to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that despite his recusal, he should act to curtail the scope of the special counsel investigation, and stop it from investigating him personally.^2

* Both Trump and Nixon acted to remove a special prosecutor investigating them.

 * Nixon directly commanded the AG and then deputy AG to fire the special prosecutor Archibald Cox.  When they both resigned rather than comply, he eventually went down to solicitor general Robert Bork to get the firing completed.^3

 * Trump ordered his White House counsel to execute the firing of Robert Mueller, however the counsel did not in fact act on the order.  He told others in the west wing (but not the President) that he would resign, but did not resign, and Trump did not follow up to insist his orders be followed.^4

**Difference**

* Nixon's conduct and especially the smoking gun tape envisage much more direct knowledge of wrongdoing, and a much clearer intention that the interference with the investigation is to prevent the FBI or special prosecutor from discovering particular damaging information.

 * It is worth [listening to the actual smoking gun tape.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oe3OgU8W0s) (Transcript below in footnotes) Nixon is discussing with his aides in detail the information the FBI is obtaining, and is extremely concerned with making sure they do not obtain any more information about the break in and payments related to it.

 * In contrast, Trump's motivations are much more centered around a general desire to avoid investigation, as opposed (as far as we know) to trying to cover up very specific negative information.  

 From a purely legal standpoint I don't think this makes a huge difference, as Trump does know his attempts to interfere are improper, which is why he does things like use Lewandowski as a cutout, and berate McGhan for keeping notes of Trump's instructions.^5

 However it is importantly different in that it is possible to envisage Trump's conduct as much more impulsive and self-obsessed than an overarching conspiracy to engage in fraudulent conduct.  Trump's acts of obstruction seem to be driven mostly by general fear, paranoia, and a total lack of impulse control.  That may be less nefarious than Nixon's methodical criminal conspiracy, but it's still quite bad.

Similarities:

* Both had stolen documents from the opposing party
* Both had attempted obstruction of justice
* Both worked to some extent with a foreign country they shouldn't have (Trump -> Russia; Nixon -> Vietnam)
* Both are polarizing figures for various reasons: People hated the Vietnam War and People dislike Trump for many reasons
* The people that stole the documents were from nations that we have a weird relationship with: Cubans helped Nixon, and Russian agents helped Trump.
* Both of them attempted to undermine the FBI investigation

Differences

* The evidence directly incriminated Nixon. Most of the issues addressed in the Mueller report are about a foreign country trying to swing an election. We don't definitively know - yet - if Trump was ever involved.
* Nixon was polarizing but respected sort of. Trump is polarizing but very few people - besides his supporters - respected him.
* Nixon's people drugged someone for trying to find out what happened

&#x200B;

Basically, most what both presidents and their people did was stuff that directly involved FBI agents, CIA agents, and many other top government officials. Nixon was almost impeached - he resigned - not because he helped drug the person or ordered them to break in. It was because he attempted to stop the investigation and the tapes proved he knew what happened and didn't stop it [\[1\]](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-was-richard-nixons-role-watergate-105480). The reason people think Trump should be impeached is because he also refused to turn in his tax returns and he has attempted to undermine an investigation. There is this book and movie called All The President's Men, it's about the two journalists that investigated Watergate. The newspaper initially refused because Nixon was very popular, but as more evidence piled up that Nixon was covering something up, they decided to run it. For that reason, I refuse to believe that if there is enough evidence, we should start the trial.",M123234,,bewltf,eq064sl

,"I think this is a somewhat subjective question in nature, but given that Nixon was pretty much recommended to be impeached while Trump was largely cleared, it's probably more fair to say that Nixon was the one who acted more corrupt/criminal.

The most notable differences I'd say are that in Nixon's case, he actually fired the special counsel in that investigation, there was an actual crime underlying his obstruction (the Watergate hotel break-in), and was part of a larger cover up scheme to bribe those involved in the Watergate break in so that they wouldn't reveal negative information. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal#Release_of_the_tapes).

Trump was accused of ""dangling pardons"" to Manafort, Flynn, Cohen, and most likely Roger Stone (the last individuals name is redacted, but it's fair to say that person is Stone) which is similar to both Clinton and Nixon's attempts to hide testimony, but there was no overt request for altered testimony in these instances. In a similar action to Nixon, Trump also fired James Comey, the FBI director at the time, but the special counsel presents evidence to indicate that Trump's reasoning for firing him may not have been the result of corrupt intent (he presents opposite evidence for this as well). Trump also tried to fire Mueller, but ultimately never did and seemed to move away and never follow up on this idea. 

I'd say more... casually, for lack of a better word, the main differences between all of them is that Trump had more areas of Obstruction examined that were all on a lower level that didn't reach a ""smoking gun"" while Nixon (tapes detailing bribery) and Clinton (witness testimony that he tried to get a witness to lie on a sworn affidavit) had that ""smoking gun"".",Darkframemaster43,,bewltf,el9urxt
,"That anti NATO article assumes that if we left NATO we'd reduce our military spending - and maybe we would a little - but I doubt it would be much.  Does Trump have any intention of reducing our military budget by whatever amount he's gotten the other NATO countries to put in?  Doesn't look like:

We get way more than our share out of NATO.  We get enormous power from the current state of affairs - especially from things like NATO and the fact that ours is the global reserve currency.

We, more than probably any other country in the world, should not be looking to rock the boat.  And the idea, as Trump tries to act, that we're getting scammed seems off the mark (and I assume simple repeated to fire up his base).",as012qwe,,betkgb,eldsm1g

June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the email
proposing the meeting had described as ""official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary."" The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."" **The written communications setting up the meeting showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist candidate Trump's electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer's presentation did not provide such information.**

,"I just want to start with the caveat that I'm speak from a United States perspective.

On the one hand, there's a lot to be said for [ensuring that all schools are teaching to the same standards](http://www.corestandards.org/assets/Criteria.pdf) (PDF warning), to ensure that, say, 3rd graders across the country are all learning approximately the same material.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of difficulty in bringing up school systems that are very far behind, deep in poverty, and/or severely underfunded. [Family income is one of the best predictors of performance on standardized tests.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/the-common-core-costs-billions-and-hurts-students.html) Parent involvement is a [huge predictor of academic success](http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/PB11_ParentInvolvement08.pdf) (PDF warning), and standardized testing isn't going to provide any information to help schools get parents involved, and may, in fact, [reduce parent involvement](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/04/09/standardized-testing-is-eroding-the-foundation-of-parental-support-and-engagement-essential-to-student-success/).

A lot of teachers are against standardized tests because, like your sources say, they want the freedom to teach the way they want to teach, rather than having to ""teach to the test."" Unfortunately, a great many teaching practices favored by teachers are [not evidence-based and are, in fact, quite ineffective](https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/research/?itemno=22607). Teachers would prefer to use strategies that ""make sense"" or ""make it fun"" without any regard for whether those strategies actually teach the material according to research.

Many think that the people who are setting the standards and determining who needs to be learning [don't understand what students really need](https://www.ajc.com/blog/get-schooled/should-congress-dismantle-department-education-and-embrace-full-local-control-schools/k89tt0Dlpembydpx0SP0vI/). When [school funding is tied to student performance on these tests](https://www.kpcw.org/post/federal-education-funding-tied-test-participation#stream/0), schools that don't have enough money to supply the resources to make sure students pass are caught in a cycle that [ensures they never get better](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/why-poor-schools-cant-win-at-standardized-testing/374287/).

There is [limited evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test#Disadvantages_and_criticism) that standardized tests accurately predict student outcomes, and, as mentioned above, they may be more closely tied to income.

It's important for schools to know whether they're actually doing their jobs, and standardized testing may provide that information. But brief [curriculum-based assessments](https://www.interventioncentral.org/response_to_intervention_school_wide_screening) take a fraction of the time and provide very useful data. Those curriculum-based assessments often come linked to evidence-based interventions, as well. [Some](http://www.springmath.com/) include programs that can be used class-wide when the majority of students aren't meeting standards.

So, basically, the idea of standardized testing is well-intentioned, and there's some good science behind the speculation, but its implementation is lacking, and it's something of a half-assed effort at ensuring high-quality education for every student.",LostxinthexMusic,,beizip,el84zn2
,"**Pros:** Education is often affected by class, and not enough is done to redress such biases. In the UK, this distinction is [heightened due to the prevalence of paid private schools in competition with state schools] (https://hrmagazine.co.uk/article-details/breaking-the-class-ceiling). Standardised testing ensures that poorer or working class students, as well as those from so-called ""broken homes"" are given a fair chance, as there are fewer opportunities for students from wealthy or educated backgrounds to be given an unfair advantage via having more educated parents ((https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853053/)) ((https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/news/2017/sep/poorer-pupils-get-less-help-homework-better-peers-study-finds))  or [being able to afford extra, private tuition] (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/09/08/the-school-system-is-already-loaded-in-favour-of-middle-class-fa/).

It can also be a good idea to encourage young students, including children, to take tests as it allows them to get used to taking harder ones later. Standardized tests theoretically ensure that terrible schools aren't allowed to exist by increasing the competition and standards (although this hasn't proven to be reliable).


**Cons:** Standardized testing tends to assume everyone learns in exactly the same way. This penalizes students with disabilities or ""special needs"", who don't learn in the same ways or as easily as everybody else. (https://www.fairtest.org/standardized-testing-and-students-disabilities)

There is no direct 'scientific' definition of 'personhood' because it is ultimately a philosophical definition (hence why it is redefined in [section 3 of the bill](http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20192020/HB/481) to explicitly include the unborn with fetal cardiac activity. The science they are likely trying to lean on is more accurate detection of cardio-pulmonary system activity, but even that is questionable as fetal EKGs (and later fetal dopplers) were used as early as 1953 to detect fetal heartbeats starting around 8 weeks (Roger K. Freeman, Thomas J. Garite, Michael P. Nageotte, Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring Third Edition, 2003, p. 3.) and modern tech only locates it to around 5 weeks [according to the mayo clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-care/art-20045302)

This is not to say however that science plays no role in the definition though as scientific developments are constantly increasing the viability of very early pregnancies (though nothing at the 5 week mark yet) and that typically does play a role in philosophical arguments on the subject.

**TL;DR** What is and is not a person is not medically defined, so while it may play a role in that argument, it is not the end all be all.",eskamobob1,,bduhg2,el2n87r
,"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/new-evidence-complicates-decisions-on-when-to-save-extremely-premature-babies/

Might have something to do with cases like this were we can and do save infants under the viability age (22 weeks in this case). In the 1970s and early 1980s, a baby like Gabriel wouldn’t have had a chance. Infants born between 20 and 25 weeks were considered nonviable. The age of viability back then was closer to 30 weeks.

,"There really isn't a way to answer this, except for asking whoever wrote the bill's text. The author of the text already has a notion of what ""a class of living, distinct person"" is and is using some sort of ""science"" to verify that. Maybe they were referring to better ultrasound tech, or the fact that text msg are a thing now and doctors can text parents pictures of their fetus. Though it is quite possible they are referring to the fact that we can now make fetuses which were non-viable a while ago, viable now. This seems to be a popular talking point nowadays.

I do not think the pardon itself would be illegal. But Trump knowing that someone was going to commit a crime and encouraging that crime with the promise of a pardon might be.

If a person has an understanding of the unlawful nature of a plan and knowingly and willfully joins in that plan on one occasion, that is sufficient to convict him for conspiracy even though he had not participated before and even though he played only a minor part.

,"My thoughts are that while the executive carries out the law it cannot ordain the law. Which is to say it can administer how a crime is treated but cannot decide if an act is a crime.

,"The simple reality is that we don't know and that this is an unsettled question in the constitution that depends heavily on how you interpret it. Most of the questions about pardons are unsettled because there just haven't been a lot of court cases about them. So there are many scholars that look at the limits on pardons. [For example, can a president self pardon or pardon someone before they are charged with a crime?](https://digitalcommons.law.msu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1233&context=facpubs). The answer to the former is that we have no idea, but the president is able to pardon someone before they are charged with a crime. 

There are complications to pardoning someone though, which is why Trump has not done it. [Anyone pardoned doesn't get 5th amendment rights anymore because they can't self incriminate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/02/if-youre-pardoned-can-you-be-compelled-to-testify-about-your-crime/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2d2762332df8). So if there is a case against Trump they must testify.

A better question to ask is, have things like this happened in the past? And the answer is yes. Regan and Bush Sr. conspired with many people to illegally sold weapons to Iran and then Bush pardoned them when he became president. Nothing bad happened to Bush over this. Many legal [articles](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1252&context=ylpr) have been written about this but there is a basic disagreement about how much power the president has. This isn't a one-off there have been many sketchy uses of [pardons in the past](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2008.02674.x).

Then there's a practical question. Fine, even if everyone agrees that this is illegal for Trump to do. What's the practical consequence? The US doesn't jail presidents, they have immunity from their actions as the executive. Maybe that immunity is limited, but again, we're in uncharted territory. Even if that immunity is limited, presidents can't be removed for engaging in criminal acts, only through impeachment. Impeachment doesn't require violating any law at all, it has no rules whatsoever, and it's not a legal process, it's a political one. Trump has more than enough support in the senate to avoid this.

,"Constructionism is the process of interpreting the words on a page without regard to the authors intent. Constructionists on the Supreme Court argued from inception that the intent of the authors of legislation or the Constitution was irrelevant. In the decisions of the past few years they have gone far beyond Constructionism ruling that they can ignore not only intent but context as well. They can base their decision on a single sentence, a phrase in a sentence or even a single word written in law without regard to the context provided in the parent phrase, sentence, paragraph or document as a whole. I will refer to this as Revisionary Constructionism since it allows the court to make pretty much any politically motivated decision they please so long as they can find some snippet that they can claim justifies it.

A solid example is recent rulings on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and Corporate Personhood. The majority ruled that corporations are ""persons"" in its interpretation  of the 1st Amendments religious freedom provision. To justify this decision they cited 1 U.S.C. §1

>the words ""person"" and ""whoever"" include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals

In doing so they deliberately ignored half the damn sentence.

>In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise— the words ""person"" and ""whoever"" include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals

""unless the context indicates otherwise"". In Revisionary Constructionism there is no context. Just whatever words they pick to justify a decision. In fact, the RFRA states:

>SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES

>(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--

>(1) the framers of the Constitution, recognizing free exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution;

The legislature chose to state it's intent up front and chose the term ""unalienable right"". Unalienable right is a reference to Natural Law or Human Rights which, ironically, has it's US roots in a religious context. 

>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights

For example, Chase Bank (a corporation) was ""created"" by JP Morgan. JP Morgan was not a deity who could imbue his creation with unalienable rights. (The Declaration of Independence is not the constitution or a law. It is where you find the definition of unalienable Rights. The concept of unalienable rights goes back further than the declaration of independence and did not reference religion or creator.)

The legislature stated it's intent up front, that the law applied to natural born humans, when it intentionally included unalienable rights in the purpose. The court chose to ignore the legislatures intent (constructionism) and further chose to cite the second phrase of 1 U.S.C. §1 while ignoring the first half of the sentence (revsionist constructionism). The problem we have is not left or right or any one issue. It is a power grab by the Supreme Court over the Legislative Branch and the Constitution itself that allows them to mold the Constitution like putty to any form that suits their political bias.

Whew! That was a lot. What was the question again? Does the United States' Constitution bestow positive rights on American citizens? It does not bestow.

,"So the issue is that the presidential election doesn't have a lot of federal regulations at the state level. The ""real"" election is when the electoral college convenes to elect the president. The state presidential election are the method states use to choose electors.

Article II clause 2 of the Constitution states 

>Each State shall appoint, **in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct**, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.

Emphasis mine

What this means is that it is almost entirely up to state law how the state chooses to send electors. It just happens that almost every state (minus Nebraska and Maine) chooses winner takes all indirect popular vote; the individual electors are not voted on, but the party that wins the popular vote appoints electors.

Theoretically, the state legislature can choose not to have a president election at all and just send whoever they want to the electoral college. This was the case for most states right after the founding, and were gradually done away with through reforms; South Carolina did not have popular vote elections for president until after the Civil war. Such a move is sure to be unpopular to say the least, and can certainly result in backlash from the rest of the states and electors.

It can be argued that this clause means that it is unconstitutional for the Federal government to prohibit the states from excluding candidates who do not fit the state criteria.

https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_presidential_candidates

> In order to get on the ballot, a candidate for president of the United States must meet a variety of complex, state-specific filing requirements and deadlines. These regulations, known as ballot access laws, determine whether a candidate or party will appear on an election ballot. These laws are set at the state level. A presidential candidate must prepare to meet ballot access requirements well in advance of primaries, caucuses, and the general election.

Here's a set of such rules in Minnesota:

,"Your example is a completely different situation and is inapplicable.

The issue here isn't whether or not a candidate can be prevented from being sworn in.  The issue is whether or not their name will be printed on the ballot.  

Federally, there are only three requirements for a person to be elected president (as spelled out in the constitution):  They must be a natural born citizen, they must be at least 35 years old, and they must have been living in the US for at least the last 14 years.  Technically, *anybody* meeting those requirements can declare themselves a candidate, and anybody winning a plurality of electoral votes wins the election.  You don't *need* your name printed on any ballot to win - provided you can convince a few tens of millions of people to write it in.

Obviously in reality, having your name printed on the ballot certainly helps.  The federal government has no requirements one way or the other regarding who is or isn't on a ballot - that's left entirely up to the states.  The states, as with most things, [each do things their own way.](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_presidential_candidates)

>[This question was asked last month and the majority opinion was that this would be unconstitutional](https://np.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/at8vkd/new_jersey_is_considering_a_bill_that_would_take/) 

I STRONGLY disagree that a ""majority opinion"" determined it would be unconstitutional. By in large, it is potentially constitutional, but many believe it is waters not worth testing (i.e., a slippery slope). But many legal scholars believe such a consideration is legal **as the allocation of electors is an exclusive right given the the legislators of the several states**.

>What is the legal reasoning a State could use to justify excluding a Presidential candidate, particularly one who had already been elected once, had been nominated for a a second run, and wasn't excluded from other states, from their Presidential ballot?

There is one important thing to remember: States are free to allocate their electorate vote however the legislature decides:

>**Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct...**

States are not required to run elections. They can allocate them themselves, they can allow the people to vote. They can do anything their own legislative wisdom allows. 

In Bush v. Gore (2000) the Supreme Court writes:

>The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the Electoral College. ... This is the source for the statement in McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 35 (1892), **that the State legislature’s power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary; it may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself, which indeed was the manner used by State legislatures in several States for many years after the Framing of our Constitution.** 

In McPherson v. Blacker (1892), the Court writes:

>Under the second clause of Article II of the Constitution, the legislatures of the several states **have exclusive power to direct the manner in which the electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed**....

In Bush v. Gore, the issue was not that Florida was not allowed to choose electors as it wishes, rather, Florida cannot ignite a fair election and ""change the rules"" after the fact. The Court writes in Bush v. Gore

>Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over that of another.

That said, nothing in Bush v. Gore prohibits a state from excluding electors on principles of its choosing, rather, if the State gives the decision to the will of the people, it cannot subtly violate the Equal Protection by favoring one person over another ***after the fact*****.** 

In the early 19th century, states' legislators often directly chose their electors. While this might seem in contrast to Bush v. Gore, those decision makers were elected by the people, under Equal Protection, to make that decision. In the same way, any decision to include or exclude candidates are made by the same decision makers, provided they adhere to Equal Protection. They are allowed to pass any amount of that decision, in whole or part, onto the people or any body they direct, so long as that procedure is followed.

The Bill most likely does not violate Equal Protection. It

1) applies to all candidates equally, 2) does not impact the ability for a group to nominate and vote for a candidate that fits their interests and 3) does not limit ballot access to any set of people.

>What challenges could Trump and other lawmakers use to counter this?

There are challenges Trump can make. The overall motif of these challenges is that a state-mandated limit for ballot access must pass the muster of Equal Protection: no majority can be boosted at the expense of a minority. For instance,

1. A state cannot place significantly more burdens on different candidates. The main issue at Anderson v. Celebrezze ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson\_v.\_Celebrezze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Celebrezze)) was that established parties had a substantially easier time qualifying their candidate for the ballot over lesser known parties or independent candidates.

Trump could challenge the requirement that the requirement places a substantial burden on him more so than other candidates. Trump could demonstrate that the requirement unfairly applies to him. There is no denying the legislation was created in response to Trump, but he would have to demonstrate that such legislation is above and beyond the almost absolute legislative right the states have to allocate their electoral votes.

To do this, Trump must effectively argue that states have the right to allocate electors BUT NOT the right to deny the allocation of electors.

2. In Williams v. Rhodes, the Court found that a State cannot unduly burden the rights of its people to petition the government. In most case law regarding ballot access, one factor is not whether or not it is fair to the candidate, but rather it is fair to the people. Here, if a group of voters are unable to get *any* of the candidates on the ballot, then arguably, they are limited from fully petitioning the government.  


With that Trump could argue that since the State is allocating the electoral votes according to the will of the people, they can not unduly abridge any of the rights of the people. This is the most likely argument. If a bill is passed with the presumed intention of disqualifying a republican candidate, then Republicans are disenfranchised. The problem with this argument is that Trump would have to argue that there is no suitable replacement candidate- that HE IS the Republican party and/or all other suitable replacement candidates will also be affected by the limitation.  

3. In state and local elections, the Court held that a filling fee of $8,900 (or about $50,000 today) was discriminatory (Bullock v. Carter). Currently, it appears that no state requires a filling fee for President, provided enough signatures are collected. ([https://ballotpedia.org/Filing\_deadlines\_and\_signature\_requirements\_for\_independent\_presidential\_candidates,\_2016](https://ballotpedia.org/Filing_deadlines_and_signature_requirements_for_independent_presidential_candidates,_2016))

The court held that such a filling fee prohibited most people from holding office thereby violating Equal Protection.

Trump could challenge the law by arguing that releasing his returns places an undue burden on him and severely limits his Equal Protection of running for office. The main counter argument here is that even if one (or several) states placed limitations, there is nothing preventing him from earning electoral votes in other states. He would have to argue that the ability to earn the electoral votes trumps the supreme right of legislators allocating those electoral votes. 

>Moreover, does complicating the process of voting for a candidate by essentially forcing voters to put him/her as a write-in (potentially dissuading voters from voting in the first place and likely damaging the candidate's party's downballot votes) count as voter suppression?

Most likely not. He would have to show that the move specifically have irreversible, uncorrectable effects for down ballot voters, these effects violate Equal Protection, there are not suitable alternative candidates AND such suppression trumps the legislators' right of appointing electors. That is a tall order and is unlikely to fly. If for nothing else preventing a candidate to be on the ballot in one race **does not take away the right for people to vote in another**. The right to vote in a Presidential election is not absolute, it is only granted to the people by the legislature; since people are not entitled to it, its presence or absence should have no bearing on other rights.",FrankLaPuof,,bcfm2x,ekqj129

All of the listed restrictions here are related to confirming constitutional eligibility.

This seems to be further complicated by the fact that most defeated law I'm finding relates to restricting *otherwise eligible candidates*, ie: by delisting people who have won before as a *de facto* way to restrict their term count, as opposed to simply adding bureaucratic steps to the application. This is likely substantial as a requirement that all valid candidates would meet (anyone who has 14 years of residency has tax returns) could be argued to not be ""restrictive"" in any sense. 

Or, very simply put: **It's unclear to me if this has actually been tested before, as all comparable law simply mandates the federal requirements at a state level.** State law cannot be used to restrict valid candidates (ie: [Arkansas](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-1456.ZO.html)), but I'm unaware of non-restrictive legislation that is not simply an extension of the constitution.

To be clear, the book absolutely sees the high turnover as hurting the country, and the Obamas have purchased the book's rights to produce a Netflix series. 

That said, it does provide abundant details and interviews that suggest a disturbing common pattern in Trump's apointees: they lack basic expertise despite replacing bureaucrats performing critical government functions (e.g. tracking nuclear waste worldwide to keep dirty bombs from reaching and being used in US soil), and do not reveal even ideologically-based policies or ambitions for how their department should be run, instead witholding leadership entirely by simply not showing up. 

This is an account that, while well-researched, nevertheless only covers the early days of the Trump administration. However, given that the book makes a strong argument regarding the importance of transition periods and briefings for undisrupted functionality during leadership changes in government bureaucracies, and the intervals between many of these recent turnover cases are not really sufficient for such efficient transitions to take place, I find it hard to believe this trend could be helping the government function, regardless of how well qualified any number of individual replacements may be.",tweaker20,,bc04va,ekmvl2t

I'd say you also have a loss of institutional knowledge any time you remove long time employees.

,"So, here is your problem. The Alaska permanent fund payout is funded by oil revenues paid by the companies exploting the resource.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund

Residents get around $2,000 by being an Alaska resident, with an annual payout of around 1.3 billion dollars.

https://www.fool.com/taxes/2017/11/18/whats-an-alaska-permanent-fund-dividend-and-how-ca.aspx

The question is how Andrew Yangs 'fund' will generate cash. There is a notion of a VAT to be added to automation companies.

So, lets do the math. In rough numbers, 75% of the US population is over 18 and therefore eligible for the UBI payout. That in people numbers is around 245 million people. Each one of those people get $12,000 per year.

The cost of this is astronomical - 3 TRILLION dollars, every year for just this.

His sources of funding are optimistic.

1) Optional elimination of welfare/snap/disability benefits. The problem is those benefits are likely worth *more* than the UBI would be. So you are cutting UBI cost but you are not making ground on expenditures.

2) VAT. Adding any new taxes to raise the prices of good will impact the economy. It will also hit the lowest income groups the hardest. I think the impact is under estimated and the money generated is over estimated.

3) New revenue - or more importantly, the money given out getting taxed by things like VAT in #2. This only works if the 'new' spending is greater than the shrinkage observed by introducing the VAT. 

4) Optimistic idea people would change behaviors. I see zero evidence this would be the case. I even have data to back this up

,"2 major problems come to mind:

1. my economics degree tells me that if you give every American $1,000.00 of additional income, the costs of living will go up by $1,000.00 - reflected in prices.  The entire macro economy is a dynamic model and you can't just make all consumers richer at the same time.  Prices reflect what people are willing to pay, and what they are willing to pay is a function of how much money they have.  If you raise all income the same amount (adding $1,000 per month to it), after  prices adjust, the average income will purchase the same basket of goods it purchased before the UBI.  It is the same as if we all took sharpies and added a zero to every dollar in our wallets.  It is not real wealth and would not raise standards of living.  I believe we can see this in action already in Alaska - I always wondered why Alaska has an abnormally high cost of living.

2. It seems unarguable that the government does not produce wealth.  For every dollar it would pay out in UBI, it must tax citizens (or leverage their future with debt).  Our federal income taxes are graduated and based on percentages, so that those who earn the most are taxed the highest, and something like 40% of households already don't pay income taxes, being under the threshold.  Assuming everyone gets the same UBI, those under the threshold will keep it, and those over will pay taxes.  So UBI looks to me like a giant shift of wealth from the earners, to the non-earners.  However, UBI is a wonderful idea for politicians hoping to ""get out the vote"" of the non-producers.",TheRealJDubb,,bb4ub9,el44n5s

If you take their alleged role in [aiding Hezbollah](http://jcpa.org/attack-golan-irans-along-israels-borders/), [Hamas](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/world/middleeast/01rockets.html) as well as the accusation of [arms delivery through the Persian Gulf](https://web.archive.org/web/20121106020940/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/11/29/iran.navy/index.html#) I'd think they seem to occupy niche as the American CIA or the Isreali Mossad.

,"> Is the designation of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization an accurate characterization

The characterization is essentially a political determination. Here's the [law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1189) that specifies the requirements to designate something a terrorist organization. It is deliberately vague and basically just says that the organization needs to be foreign, do terrorist things, and do those terrorist things in opposition to Americans and American interests.

So the IRGC technically fulfills that criteria, but lots of other organizations also would fulfill that criteria that aren't so labeled. Moreover, the mechanism for declaring a terrorist organization has generally not referred to state entities, which the IRGC is.

Ultimately, the terrorist organization declaration is a political decision. It's not like the designated organization can sue in a US court. But in the past it's also been used more in a bipartisan, de-politicized fashion with government experts and bureaucrats deciding

**The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard**

Next, let's look at what the IRGC actually *is*. Rather than conforming to the relatively strict definitions of Western government agencies, the IRGC is what's broadly referred to as a ""security service/force"". It's a combination of paramilitary, military force, intelligence agency, police force, personal guard, investment bank, protection racket, and more. Formed to safeguard the 1979 Revolution and the person of the Ayatollah, it gained a significant degree of internal power during the Iran-Iraq War, both for fighting anti-regime insurgencies in Iran and on the Iraqi front where its paramilitary Basij militia were known for their fanatical attacks against Iraqi forces

Today, the IRGC has its fingers in every single pie in Iran and Iran's foreign policy. It's in essence a shadow state within Iran, and is the core of the Iranian foreign policy and military establishment. The IRGC has influence over who gets appointed to clerical positions, over the nominally extant civilian intelligence services, the Iranian military, the civilian economy, policing, etc. Two elements of particular notoriety for our purposes are the IRGC's economic influence, and its principal foreign operations arm, the Quds Force.

I'm not going to do in-line citations, but these are two great sources about the IRGC. The first is from the [Counter-Extremism Project](https://www.counterextremism.com/threat/islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-irgc) which represents a center-right/respectable republican view with more of an emphasis of the IRGC as a terrorist group, while the second is a [Stratfor report](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-part-1-unconventional-military) that's a little out of date, but emphasizes the IRGC's status within the Iranian state

**The IRGC and the Iranian Economy**

In terms of its economic influence, as mentioned the IRGC is part of every sector of the Iranian economy. Former Guard commanders often retire relatively young (50s) and many are top executives or officials within Iran's industries, including oil, construction, and manufacturing. While Iran has been under longstanding US sanctions and varying degrees of international sanction, it isn't a closed economy and many countries have done varying degrees of business with Iranian firms - therefore doing business with the IRGC. A second element is underground operations - as a state under economic sanction, Iran has resorted to extralegal economic activities, something the IRGC is deeply involved with given its clandestine nature and strong economic base. An extremely ironic example of this is the[ Trump family investment in a building in Baku](https://www.salon.com/2019/04/08/does-donald-trump-have-business-entanglements-with-irans-revolutionary-guard_partner/), which was almost certainly used as a money laundering front for the IRGC

**The Quds Force**

The Quds force is what most US policymakers focus on when it comes to the IRGC. Essentially the Quds force is the foreign intelligence arm of the IRGC. Its main focus is providing arms, equipment, funds, and training to various Iranian clients and allies throughout the Middle East - especially the Assad regime and the pro-government militia that make up its military, Shiite militia in Iraq fighting the Islamic State, the Yemeni Houthis currently fighting the Saudis and GCC forces in Yemen, Lebanese Hezbollah, and Hamas in Gaza. As a part of those organizations, it's been implicated in various war crimes and attacks on civilians associated with those groups. It's also been associated with other more clearly terroristic groups and acts - most notably the 2011 assassination attempt against the Saudi ambassador in DC. Important to note - the Quds Force itself has been designated a terrorist group by the US since 2007

> What is the strategic value of this designation and what is the intended outcome?

This is the hard question to answer. The answer is...nobody knows. Designating the IRGC a terrorist organization has long been a right wing foreign policy priority, in keeping with their broader hostility to Iran. Conservative proponents point to the IRGC's long track record of anti-american intelligence activities (something nobody would disagree with), and rightfully point out that designating the Quds Force a terrorist organization but not the IRGC is a toothless gesture, considering how intertwined the two are. 

But it also can't be avoided that the IRGC in many ways *is* the Iranian state. Iran may be a state hostile the US and US allies, but it isn't a rogue regime by any means. Iran kept up its end of the bargain in the nuclear deal, and while many foreign intelligence agencies are active against US interests (Russian and Chinese intelligence foremost), none of those are designated terrorist groups because we (rightfully) tend to draw a line between ""hostile state actor"" and ""hostile terror group""

If there's a specific policy goal in mind, it's likely to help cripple the Iranian economy. The Iran deal lifted many of the global sanctions against Iran, and the Trump administration has been unsuccessful in convincing US allies, let alone US rivals, from reinstating the sanction regime once they withdrew from the agreement. This terror designation in some ways could take the place of sanctions - as the IRGC has a role in every single part of the Iranian economy, any foreign company that does business with Iran is effectively doing business with the IRGC. And if the IRGC is a terrorist organization, that opens up firms to punitive action by the US government. While that might not matter for Chinese or Russian companies with minimal US footprints, that will certainly add risk to any European companies, like Airbus or Siemens, that expressed interest in the Iranian market. Basically, it runs the risk of technically ""funding a terrorist group"" if you do something like sell an airplane to Iran, and running the legal risks of that in the US

It's also unavoidable that this itself is another front of the culture wars. Conservative opposition to Iran often goes beyond narrow US interests and into more cultural rhetoric about Israel, something that the right-wing Israeli government has encouraged as the IRGC is a significant source of funding for their antagonists in Hamas and Hezbollah. This is one of the few foreign policy moves that can play into evangelical christian domestic political opinion

Finally, as for Iran's reaction to this, it likely depends on how serious the US is about enforcing the terror designation. If the US keeps the designation largely symbolic, the IRGC might keep their reaction largely to a symbolic attack or demonstration. Perhaps a shipment of missiles to the Houthis or something like that. But if the US starts using (or abusing depending on your viewpoint) the designation as a cudgel against the Iranian economy as a whole, the IRGC might seek to impose economic or political costs on the US or US allies in some way",Hoyarugby,,bav0rl,ekfrej0

,"It would not be constitutional in my opinion.  Beginning in 1875, the Supreme Court endorsed a view of the Fourteenth Amendment that flatly rejected granting redress to private actions because white citizens did not enjoy the same protection as black citizens.  This precedent is still active in American common law and was reinforced in 2000 when the Supreme Court relied on the same *Civil Rights Cases* (see *United States v. Stanley; United States v. Ryan; United States v. Nichols; United States v. Singleton; Robinson et ux. v. Memphis & Charleston R.R. Co.*)^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Cases).

>Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which permits Congress
to enforce by appropriate legislation the constitutional guarantee
that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without
due process, or deny any person equal protection of the laws, City
of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517, also does not give Congress the
authority to enact § 13981. Petitioners' assertion that there is pervasive
bias in various state justice systems against victims of gender motivated
violence is supported by a voluminous congressional record.
**However, the Fourteenth Amendment places limitations on the manner
in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct. Foremost
among them is the principle that the Amendment prohibits only state
action, not private conduct.** This was the conclusion reached in United
States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3,
which were both decided shortly after the Amendment's adoption.
The force of the doctrine of stare decisis behind these decisions stems
not only from the length of time they have been on the books, but also
from the insight attributable to the Members of the Court at that time,
who all had intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding
the Amendment's adoption. Neither United States v. Guest,
383 U. S. 745, nor District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U. S. 418, casts
any doubt on the enduring vitality of the Civil Rights Cases and Harris.
Assuming that there has been gender-based disparate treatment by
state authorities in these cases, it would not be enough to save § 13981's
civil remedy, which is directed not at a State or state actor but at individuals
who have committed criminal acts motivated by gender bias.
Section 13981 visits no consequence on any Virginia public official involved
in investigating or prosecuting Brzonkala's assault, and it is
thus unlike any of the § 5 remedies this Court has previously upheld.
See, e. g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301. Section 13981
is also different from previously upheld remedies in that it applies uniformly
throughout the Nation, even though Congress' findings indicate
that the problem addressed does not exist in all, or even most, States.
In contrast, the § 5 remedy in Katzenbach was directed only to those
States in which Congress found that there had been discrimination.

Slavery was a private enterprise, not state-action, and consequently reparations would most assuredly be unconstitutional under this precedent.
