approvecomment,"I need this sub back so much.

I posted an article to r/news about how Twitter's CEO was pledging $1 billion to help fight COVID-19.

It was auto-blocked because it was talking about the coronavirus. When I asked the mods to allow it, they said that it was a ""blog"" even though it was from Forbes.

Before I could respond with the several other sources covering the story (CNBC, Reuters, etc.) they soft-banned me for 72 hours so I couldn't reply.

There are several times something breaking happens and it's never on r/news because it has to go through an insane vetting process to get it posted.

And by the time it does get through, it's considered old news and doesn't get posted anyway.

At least here if there was a biased bs article, the people in the comments would say so. And that went for both sides.

approvecomment,">It was auto-blocked because it was talking about the coronavirus. When I asked the mods to allow it, they said that it was a ""blog"" even though it was from Forbes.

Not sure if you are aware, but Forbes hosts blogs. It catches people off guard because they see the forbes url and large brand name, but they are blogs. Haven't seen one in a while but they use to say the authors name in the url I believe, which is how news catches them. They also say contributing poster or something instead of the normal byline. Its not even an oped, the forbes site doesnt check them.

approvecomment,"The intensity of the outbreak in the five worst ranking US states in daily cases (Arizona, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Florida) reminded me of an article highlighting a higher predicted propensity of conservatives over liberals to use precaution in reaction to a pandemic, but found partisanship (D/R) to be a stronger factor.

>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/opinion/coronavirus-trump-partisanship.html

>The Graham-Haidt study suggests that conservatives would show a higher level of fear of the pandemic and a readiness to comply with restrictions on interpersonal contact.

>A group of four California-based scholars is exploring why this is not the case.

>In an intriguing ongoing study, Colin Holbrook, a professor of cognitive science at the University of California-Merced, and Daniel M. T. Fessler, Theodore Samore and Adam Sparks, all of the anthropology department at U.C.L.A., find a sharp split in the behavior of conservative Democrats and conservative Republicans.

>Holbrook wrote by email that he and his colleagues

>""assessed disgust sensitivity and found conservatism in our present sample predicted greater disgust-proneness. The emotion of disgust functions to curtail disease-transmission, suggesting that conservatives should, all else equal, be likely to take greater disease precautions.""

>They then â€œmeasured precautionary behaviors, such as hand-washing, mask-wearing, social distancing, seeking cleaning supplies, etc.â€� and found that

>""conservatism, measured in a number of distinct ways, positively and highly significantly predicts precautionary behaviors among the Democrats in our sample, but not among the Republicans.""

>Holbrook wrote that this apparent contradiction grows out of the responsiveness of the conservative Republicans

>""to authority messaging, from the president as well as other conservative political and media figures. There are theoretical reasons to expect that, had conservative authority figures encouraged them to do so, conservative Republicans would be as likely â€” perhaps even more likely â€” as conservative Democrats to engage in precautionary behaviors.

>Put another way, loyalty to Trump and others on the right was more powerful than the strong inclination among these Republican voters to take steps to insulate themselves from the threat of the coronavirus.

>Jesse Graham, in an email, wrote that â€œwhen people ask me the question â€˜if conservatives are more concerned with purity, why are red states being so slow to act against a viral contagion?â€™â€� he replies:

>""I donâ€™t think these political differences are due to any underlying values differences between liberals and conservatives. I think itâ€™s due to the almost immediate politicization of the threat, with Trump and Fox News downplaying the seriousness of Covid-19, and â€˜left-leaningâ€™ reality-based sources issuing the more dire warnings.

>Ditto puts the matter succinctly: â€œIn 21st century American politics, truth is tribal.â€�

>In other words, the pandemic has become another example of Trumpâ€™s mastery over his most loyal subjects, his ability to manipulate them into violating their own instincts.

Regarding the black/white list, have the mods considered using news guard as well? I haven't heard of the MBFC before, and don't have the time at the moment to look into it. I have been using the news guard extension for a long time now and it gives a generally good breakdown on whether a site is reliable (as you noted in the post, this is based on factual reporting, not bias).

Additionally, for those smaller or local sites that aren't covered, the mods could evaluate them as is mentioned. Since mods themselves have biases and since, at least in NP, seem to be quite fair, a solution could be to have a mod of either affiliation evaluate the site prior to acceptance/declination. A dispute could be resolved by a third mod, if needed.

Lastly, for the scenario above, clear criteria for acceptance/declination should be provided and the users should be able to appeal a decision.

These subreddit are badly needed in today's environment. Thanks for the hard work.

Otherwise, for many users it's just a headline of an article.

removecomment,"WASHINGTONâ€”The Supreme Court ordered changes to a government consumer-finance watchdog created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, ruling the agencyâ€™s structure was unconstitutional because its director held too much unchecked power.

To address the problem, the court held that the president can remove the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for any reason. The court rejected broader legal arguments that it should strike down the bureau altogether.

The decision on Monday caps a 10-year legal battle over the CFPB, which was designed to protect consumers from abusive financial-industry practices on products like mortgages, student loans and credit cards.

In a 5-4 ruling, the court said Congress overstepped constitutional lines in 2010 when it created the CFPB and placed it under the control of a single director who was insulated from the White Houseâ€™s political direction. Lawmakers, attempting to give the bureau a buffer from political influence, said the director could only be removed by the president for â€œinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.â€�

But the court, in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, said the setup meant the CFPBâ€™s director was unaccountable to the executive branch, creating an unconstitutional reduction of presidential power.

â€œThe CFPBâ€™s single-director structure contravenes this carefully calibrated system by vesting significant governmental power in the hands of a single individual accountable to no one,â€� the chief justice wrote.

Kathy Kraninger, the current CFPB director, on Twitter said the ruling â€œfinally brings certainty to the operations of the Bureau. We will continue with our important mission of protecting consumers with no question that we are fully accountable to the President.â€�

â€œConsumers and market participants should understand that the same rules continue to govern the consumer financial marketplace,â€� Ms. Kraninger said.

The bureau, the brainchild of former Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, has been politically polarizing, with Democrats citing a need to combat financial-industry excesses and Republicans warning of runaway government regulation.

The Trump administration declined to defend the CFPB and agreed with legal challengers who argued its structure was unlawful, abandoning the legal position of the Obama administration.

The central portion of Mondayâ€™s decision against the CFPBâ€™s structure split the court along ideological lines, with conservatives in the majority. Joining Chief Justice Roberts were Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The courtâ€™s four liberal justices dissented.

â€œTodayâ€™s decision wipes out a feature of that agency its creators thought fundamental to its missionâ€”a measure of independence from political pressure,â€� Justice Elena Kagan wrote. Joining her dissent were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.",264db330beb6c1f3e3a9b504592a016b,Rule 5: top-level comment has no links,hi4x3g,5efa35854af4320009442168

removecomment,">The case began in 2015 when the Montana Legislature passed a bill providing a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for individuals who donate to organizations that provide scholarship money to students in private schools. An organization called Big Sky began raising money to fund these scholarships, using the tax credit as an incentive. Of the 13 schools that got scholarship money from Big Sky, 12 were religious schools. Indeed, 70% of all private schools in Montana are religiously affiliated.

>Ultimately, the Montana Supreme Court struck down the entire tax credit program for all private schools, religious and nonreligious alike. It said the tax credit conflicted with the state constitution, which bars all state aid for religious education, whether direct or indirect, including tax subsidies like this one.

So the Montana Supreme Court shut down the program, and now the Federal Supreme Court is making them start it back up?

I wonder if the Supreme Court ruling would stop the state legislature from passing a law to abandon the program.",097c7b5d27537777cb28063b3e7b485f,Rule 5: top-level comment has no links,hioh3o,5efb7ef54af4320009444897

Seriously though how dope would a UPS extension that is just a shipping company be? Considering shipping is necessary to almost all Americans getting food having a baseline infrastructure to get food where it is needed no mater what would be very good in emergencies, wartime, and just when the economy crashes once again. Thatâ€™s what the government should provide, safety and infrastructure. Those are what we build society on! I donâ€™t need 17 more tanks personally, but regular food shipments to my grocery store would be nice, especially if the truck driver is given good healthcare and not overworked so our supply chain is built strong.

5.	Almost immediately on twitter and reddit, I saw a significant amount of people claiming the driver was black and this couldnâ€™t be a hate crime, that the protestors should not be protesting on the freeway, and that they hoped the car was ok and that he had good insurance.

removecomment,"You will never get it even 1% higher.  Compliance declines with each passing day.

The optimal outcome was stay-at-home + social distancing.  But *given that people will not stay at home or social distance*, then the next optimal outcome is achieved by reopening immediately, because it provides tax revenue and generates economic activity. 

People's refusal to (and the government's legal and constitutional  inability to enforce) stay-at-home orders means infections will rise *even when the economy is closed*. And so will hospitalizations and deaths.  This literally cannot be stopped now.  New York is not the case study, Wisconsin is.  So we might as well open the economy and put everyone back to work so that there is income and taxes to pay for the fallout.

Masks are pointless as a public health measure if only half of the people wear them.  In places in florida, no one is wearing them.  

So stop trying to achieve the best possible result.  We should try to achieve the best possible result *given the reality of the situation*.  Americans don't care about each other.  They just don't.  And it isn't just the Trump people.  Whose idea was it to schedule a nationwide series of urban protests in the middle of an infectious disease pandemic?  

Given the levels of ignorance, obesity, alcohol and drug abuse, Americans barely care about themselves, they certainly don't care about the greater good.

* They take positions that American students won't get, but who's parents pay taxes to support. 

* Allow the universities to to use foreign grad students (Masters and PHDs) as indentured servants while ignoring American students who won't put up with the low pay, long hours, etc because they don't need an eventual greed card. 

* Discourages Americans from getting masters and PHDs because the field is so saturated with foreigners that the salaries in private sector are low. This was actually a talking point used by Congress when deciding on these policies years ago - industry wanted cheaper employees with PHDs, and the best way to do that would be to flood the market with foreigners. 

* Allows universities, who are charted and given huge public subsidies to educate America citizens, to sell off citizenship via unlimited H1B visas, Opt program, Green Card giveaways, etc. This is the job of the elected Congress and executive branch to make these immigration decisions, not unelected university officials who are massively profiting off the system. 

* The OPT visa allows recent grads to take millions of entry level jobs of American grads, especially when the unemployment rate is higher than ever before.  The US government actually encourages US entry level workers  being fucked over in the job market by not requiring foreign students and US employers to pay FICA taxes that American employers and employees have to pay.

I can assure you of two things:

* There are few educated jobs out there in rural America that are going unfilled because of lack of workers. At best, there is a need for doctors in some areas, but there are actually American trained med students out there who cannot work because too many foreign medical students took up the limited amount of residencies. 

* For high tech, finance, and other high paying jobs, these are not located anywhere but the big hub cities. They are already flooded with foreign workers, and Americans have been angry about this for two decades. In fact, Donald Trump may just owe his 2016 win on promising to end the H1B and other visa scams, which he just did ban temporarily. 

Trust me, there is no shortage of jobs in the US. There is only a shortage of jobs being paid the very low wages that employers want to pay.

The closing of the border was never meant to do anything other than stop one of the worst contagion vectors. So it have been very effective at doing its job

(Do you see a difference here between the aim of the US closing and the European?, Hint: The virus was already in the US when Trump closed the border.)

>Tourists are there to see things and do stuff, normally places with a lot of people.

This is the reason tourists are a very bad worst contagion vector.

>Where as people returning home have a home where they can quarantine until tested/14 days.

Is the information you are missing that this was the general recommendation or law (depending on time and location)

>Either sufficient citizen follow the guidelines to protect their countrymen or rules have been put place to ensure they do. So some have mandatory quarantine, but I don't think any country have been required to enforce it on entry.

Well if so... Enough people coming home did what they where meant to do or rules where made to make them do what they where meant to do.

The US, on the other hand, has a much more transparent environment of Government/press/culture, but we do have a president who seems hell bent on pretending that COVID isnâ€™t really a big deal, and we have the respect of most other nations.

approvecomment,">I think Trump and the US are just assuming that the CDC and NIH will be able to perform whatever tasks the WHO were performing for the US

To add to your point about staying in WHO, I do want to point out how the CDC can (and has) messed up in handling pandemics, and has the vulnerability of being influenced by the executive branches administration. 

First, the CDC [royally messed up on developing tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.amp.html) in the early stages of COVID, leaving us in a pretty difficult spot during a critical time period. For those who donâ€™t knowâ€” WHO already had a test ready to go in January, but the CDC decided to develop their own test. This is actually a normal procedure during pandemics, but the test the CDC developed was generating tons of false positives at independent labs throughout the country, so each and every test had to be shipped to the CDC lab before they could actually tell the person the results of their test, resulting in each person having to wait about a week before getting their test results. This lasted **over a month** (again, at the very beginning of the pandemic, when we had a very small, but crucial, span of time to get it under control) before they fixed the error. 

Recently, [they admitted to](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/499085-cdc-acknowledges-mixing-up-coronavirus-testing-data?amp) combining the results from viral and antibody COVID-19 tests when reporting the country's testing totals, despite marked differences between the tests, in their public reporting. Seemingly at the behest of the White House administration. 

And after Trump and the current CDC Director were definitely at odds during a press conference in late April, [Jeffrey Koplan, a former CDC Director](https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/where-is-the-cdc-trump-covid-19-pandemic), described the current situation regarding the CDCs relationship with the executive branch as â€œfull of frustration and embarrassment. Itâ€™s like youâ€™re an accomplished violinist playing in a quartet and youâ€™re told you canâ€™t use your right arm. Thatâ€™s the feeling.â€�


So while it might not compare to being â€œcompromisedâ€� by China, thereâ€™s still a lot of iffy possibilities that come out of relying solely on our national health organizationsâ€” namely the fact that the CDC is not entirely independent seeing as its director serves at the pleasure of the President and may be fired and replaced without Senate confirmation at any timeâ€”So if we have a president who wants to downplay the severity of a pandemic, he/she has the authority to do so and indirectly compel organizations like the CDC and NIH to do so as well.",03bfabfcc8b989cee48257c071b21640,confirm_ham,hn1me3,5f0585454af432000944acf1

**Robert Mueller: Roger Stone remains a convicted felon, and rightly so**

Robert S. Mueller III, July 11, 2020

*Robert S. Mueller III served as special counsel for the Justice Department from 2017 to 2019.*

â€œThe work of the special counselâ€™s office â€” its report, indictments, guilty pleas and convictions â€” should speak for itself. But I feel compelled to respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office. The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so.

Russiaâ€™s actions were a threat to Americaâ€™s democracy. It was critical that they be investigated and understood. By late 2016, the FBI had evidence that the Russians had signaled to a Trump campaign adviser that they could assist the campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to the Democratic candidate. And the FBI knew that the Russians had done just that: Beginning in July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails stolen by Russian military intelligence officers from the Clinton campaign. Other online personas using false names â€” fronts for Russian military intelligence â€” also released Clinton campaign emails.

Following FBI Director James B. Comeyâ€™s termination in May 2017, the acting attorney general named me as special counsel and directed the special counselâ€™s office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The order specified lines of investigation for us to pursue, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. One of our cases involved Stone, an official on the campaign until mid-2015 and a supporter of the campaign throughout 2016. Stone became a central figure in our investigation for two key reasons: He communicated in 2016 with individuals known to us to be Russian intelligence officers, and he claimed advance knowledge of WikiLeaksâ€™ release of emails stolen by those Russian intelligence officers.

We now have a detailed picture of Russiaâ€™s interference in the 2016 presidential election. The special counselâ€™s office identified two principal operations directed at our election: hacking and dumping Clinton campaign emails, and an online social media campaign to disparage the Democratic candidate. We also identified numerous links between the Russian government and Trump campaign personnel â€” Stone among them. We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities. The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.

Uncovering and tracing Russian outreach and interference activities was a complex task. The investigation to understand these activities took two years and substantial effort. Based on our work, eight individuals pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial, and more than two dozen Russian individuals and entities, including senior Russian intelligence officers, were charged with federal crimes.

Congress also investigated and sought information from Stone. A jury later determined he lied repeatedly to members of Congress. He lied about the identity of his intermediary to WikiLeaks. He lied about the existence of written communications with his intermediary. He lied by denying he had communicated with the Trump campaign about the timing of WikiLeaksâ€™ releases. He in fact updated senior campaign officials repeatedly about WikiLeaks. And he tampered with a witness, imploring him to stonewall Congress.

The jury ultimately convicted Stone of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress and tampering with a witness. Because his sentence has been commuted, he will not go to prison. But his conviction stands.

Russian efforts to interfere in our political system, and the essential question of whether those efforts involved the Trump campaign, required investigation. In that investigation, it was critical for us (and, before us, the FBI) to obtain full and accurate information. Likewise, it was critical for Congress to obtain accurate information from its witnesses. When a subject lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of the governmentâ€™s efforts to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable. It may ultimately impede those efforts.

We made every decision in Stoneâ€™s case, as in all our cases, based solely on the facts and the law and in accordance with the rule of law. The women and men who conducted these investigations and prosecutions acted with the highest integrity. Claims to the contrary are false.â€�",03bfabfcc8b989cee48257c071b21640,confirm_ham,hpjk4b,5f0a8bf14af432000944da25

[You can certainly even apply some of the same objectivity we often think of applying to facts to values ](http://greensprout.homelinux.com/OldSalt/MyOldSalt/www.virtualsalt.com/int/factvalue.pdf)


>	Facts and values, instead of being utterly separate, are often entangled and inseparable.
â€¢ Values, far from being matters of taste, are integral to the process of knowing. In other words, values are essential to the realm of facts. Michael Polanyi notes that â€œscience itself can be pursued and transmitted to succeeding generations only within an elaborate system of traditional beliefs and values, just as traditional beliefs have proved indispensable throughout the life of society.â€�65
â€¢ Evaluation is often an essential part of description and therefore values are a necessary part of an accurate description of reality.
â€¢ Both facts and values can be discussed and handled rationally.
â€¢ Value statements (or value-judgments) can be objective.
â€¢ Verificationism and falsificationism have both been either abandoned
or modified in the arena of fact in order to allow scientific claims that cannot be verified or falsified. So it is unreasonable to insist that verificationism or falsificationism must apply to the arena of valuesâ€” to the arena of non-empirical but objective facts and values.
â€¢ It is incorrect to assign all non-empirical truth claims to the realm of values.

removecomment,"I will not waste my time criticizing or insulting Dr. Anthony Fauci as 1) he is unlikely to change, and 2) Fauci probably revels in the letters of shock and repulsion that he regularly receives. Instead, I will focus on his truculent hatchet jobs, which, after all, are the things that give furciferous ruffians far more credibility than they deserve. Let's get down to brass tacks: If his criticisms were intended as a joke, he forgot to include the punchline. I believe I have found my calling. My calling is to reveal the constant tension between centripetal and centrifugal forces of dialogized heteroglossia resulting from his prevarications. And just let him try and stop me. I receive a great deal of correspondence from people all over the world. One of the things that impresses me about all of it is the massive number of people who realize that Fauci is extremely negligent. In fact, my handy-dandy Negligent-O-Meter confirms that Fauci has secretly been allowing federally funded research to mushroom into a hotheaded, grossly inefficient system, hampered by maleficent, impertinent chumps and sick peddlers of snake-oil remedies. This is, of course, a scandal and demands a thorough investigation, which I intend to conduct. I expect to find that Fauci feels that we need â€œdiversity counselorsâ€� to orchestrate our feelings and opinions. However, he cannot tolerate the world as it is. He needs to live in a world of fantasies. To be more specific, some people have indicated that the main thing that I'm trying to get at here is that we all have gifts, qualities, and talents that must be put to use to objurgate Fauci for sounding the standard â€œthey're out to get usâ€� call and rallying his provocateurs to vilify our history, character, values, and traditions. I can neither confirm nor deny that statement, but I can say that the implications of this are obvious. To spell it out, though, if today we don't ensure that we survive and emerge triumphant out of the coming chaos and destruction, then tomorrow we'll have to put up with Fauci operating in the gray area between legitimate activity and fusty McCarthyism. Let me now leave you with some parting advice: Fix your thoughts on that which is true and honorable and right and pure and lovely and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. For now, put aside the fact that squalid utopians are the lowest form of human life. And with that advice, go in peace.

Holy moly, you didn't even try not to straw man his entire argument.

> That cases don't mean death, or even illness?


[Here are some charts] (https://imgur.com/a/Ys8P6ve), courtesy of the NY Times.

Some top level takeaways:

- Florida, Arizona, Texas, and California (included specifically to deflect accusations of partisanship, though the trendline is notably less bad) all are showing a rolling 7-day average increasing as of recently.

- Georgia indeed looks fine.

Some caveats

- States can be inaccurately reporting COVID deaths, either out of malice (to make their numbers better) or out of difficulties with testing. Excess mortality rate can help us understand a statistical upper bound on these death rates. Sadly I can't find my source, but I recall reading California was at 40% lower and Texas and Florida were at 55-60%.

- Deaths lag infections/ hospitalizations by a month or so. As cases are at an all time high now, we expect an all time high in deaths to occur in a month.

- Death rates spike when hospitals get overloaded. Not necessarily just in ICU capacity but medicine (e.g. [remdesivir shortages in Florida](https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2020/07/08/coronavirus-florida-hospitals-face-shortage-covid-19-drug-redesivir/5384660002/)) or especially staff.

- On a bright note, doctors have gotten better at treating patients, which should lower death rates relative to what we saw in NY (and Italy/Spain before) at the worst.

- [Date of reporting VS Actual Date](https://twitter.com/kylamb8/status/1283077123796799488/photo/1). A bit hard to read but you'll see that, for example, of the 4,286 deaths reported (orange bar at top) for the week of 7/4/2020, **only 302** (red bottom) were from that week. Rest are backdated. Take this into account when looking at that 7 day rolling average. (not divided by state unfortunately)
- Also take in the fact that these numbers don't differentiate cause ""from"" or ""with"" covid. And some of those excess mortalities are now being listed as ""suspected"" getting them into these numbers. 
- As for those excess mortalities, consider people not going to hospitals due to fear/lockdown, preventable things causing excess death. In [nine hospitals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gracemarieturner/2020/05/22/600-physicians-say-lockdowns-are-a-mass-casualty-incident/#5f531e5850fa), heart attacks being treated have dropped *40%* since march.  
- As far as I can tell US is back to [baseline mortality](https://twitter.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1282811156785135618/photo/2)
- As for ""overwhelmed hospitals"" media tends not [to give full context](https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1283100342557827073). Also consider the pent up demand, everyone is tested, and therefore being admitted as positive cases even though that's not why they're there. (eg. knee surgery with an asymptomatic case of cov2). The [reality on the ground](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/hln17z/4_tampa_bay_fl_hospitals_run_out_of_icu_beds/fx0o8jx/) is quite different. 
- Yeah, in NY [they were dropping just about anybody onto a damaging vent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ). And dubious nursing home strategy. Look at the difference in [NY vs FL mortality](https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1282776782660304898). This barely hit epidemic levels outside of [some specific states](https://twitter.com/boriquagato/status/1280683258397642764)...
- California sees same surge despite masking and lockdowns for months
- Sweden on same curve as everywhere else, no lockdown, now at basically zero deaths (and increase in cases). [Very interesting article](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/whitney-looks-sweden-was-right-after-all) regarding ""Herd Immunity Threshold"" being 10-20% due to most of population already having T-cell immunity. Or hear it from the [doctors](https://unherd.com/thepost/swedish-doctor-t-cell-immunity-and-the-truth-about-covid-19-in-sweden/) themselves. This is all with Sweden's very [broad counting policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCirclejerk/comments/hn06pd/sweden_has_become_the_worlds_cautionary_tale/fx8dwxp/). This also explains the huge amount of asymptomatic cases.
- Cases have already been [rising for a month](https://twitter.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1283092982795841537/photo/1), but we always need to wait longer...

> Hard to know what is going on here.

To me, all this paints a narrative that the virus will run through populations, only being slowed a bit by lockdowns. With a herd immunity threshold of ~20-30% (like *most other virus*). The virus itself is not that deadly, the reactions to it and poor treatment were (NY vs FL). The sunbelt is now seeing it's ""first wave"", with many mild/asymptomatic cases being captured due to increased testing. An increase in ""confirmed cases"" is largely no cause for concern. As the data science article said, we've probably already had *30 million cases* and are on our way to *60 million*. By the end of the year I'm sure he will be proven correct with regards to excess mortality. We are living in a totally farcical ""pandemic"" narrative, based on data illiteracy as per that article. We might have destroyed the economy and having all this ongoing hysteria for nothing. Sweden has not fallen into the sea. I'm really starting to think doing nothing besides asking those able to work from home to do so, would have been the best option.",ebb75a49c4d17db4de6ddea95b8b74fe,remove,hqj618,5f0e4a894af432000945015d

Solid analysis from June, [sadly that was when cases were at an all time low] (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html). Cases have only risen since then.

[One can certainly even apply some of the same objectivity we often think of applying to facts to values ](http://greensprout.homelinux.com/OldSalt/MyOldSalt/www.virtualsalt.com/int/factvalue.pdf)


>	Facts and values, instead of being utterly separate, are often entangled and inseparable.
â€¢ Values, far from being matters of taste, are integral to the process of knowing. In other words, values are essential to the realm of facts. Michael Polanyi notes that â€œscience itself can be pursued and transmitted to succeeding generations only within an elaborate system of traditional beliefs and values, just as traditional beliefs have proved indispensable throughout the life of society.â€�65
â€¢ Evaluation is often an essential part of description and therefore values are a necessary part of an accurate description of reality.
â€¢ Both facts and values can be discussed and handled rationally.
â€¢ Value statements (or value-judgments) can be objective.
â€¢ Verificationism and falsificationism have both been either abandoned
or modified in the arena of fact in order to allow scientific claims that cannot be verified or falsified. So it is unreasonable to insist that verificationism or falsificationism must apply to the arena of valuesâ€” to the arena of non-empirical but objective facts and values.
â€¢ It is incorrect to assign all non-empirical truth claims to the realm of values.

Compared to a lot of the world's population I am a winner, but I also follow the science of climate change and can see how much momentum the counter movement has. It will be 100 years of lawsuits before we get big oil into line. 

The oceans will die before that, so will the Amazon. In what remains of my middle aged lifetime. Tha Arctic will thaw not by 2100 which we initially predicted, but within 10 years, driving a feedback loop that will rapidly warm the oceans meaning less arctic ice will freeze again each winter.

Then there's what's frozen in the ice, bacteria, viruses and god knows what (prions?). Now look at how the world is coping with the covid19 pandemic, when they should be treating this as practice for what's to come.

Life isn't gonna be fun for the next generations. Global famines, wars, mass extinctions as the eco system collapses, mass casualty weather events becomming normal... on and on. All the while if I was to describe the world's current view on this - it would be denial.

It seems to be this whole article is just dancing around one of the well-known problems with two-income and single-parent families: daycare and nannies are a poor substitute for a stay-at-home parent and they affect children negatively.

approvecomment,"Fertility is highly sensitive to socio-economic conditions. Itâ€™s not â€œnatural selectionâ€�. The fertility rate is determined by the sum total of the economic choices of people acting in their rational self-interest.

In underdeveloped societies, child mortality is high, access to health care is low, the cost of living is low, the need for agricultural and low-skilled labor is great, there are no social security or pension systems, and girls are devalued relative to boys and are married off young. In response to all these conditions, people choose to have many children as they possibly can because they know that many of those children will likely die young, and half will be girls, and they need to have spares in order to ensure that they will have enough adult sons to provide for them in their old age. 

As a society moves up the socio-economic development scale, its fertility rate first spikes, and then its fertility rate crashes.

The initial spike in infertility occurs when the infant mortality rates drops as a result of better access to modern health care services. People are still having lots of babies, but those babies no longer die. The population booms. 

Then the crash comes when couples, who are now confident that their children will not likely die, opt to have fewer children utilizing birth control and other family planning methods. They then invest more of their resources into the health and education of the few children they do have in order to push them up the socio-economic ladder, out of low-income agriculture and manual labor sectors and into high-income skilled labor sectors. This rise in demand for education also causes the marginal cost of each additional child to rise as well.

Then, compounding on top of this, as girls are receiving betters educations, they put off child-bearing to join the labor force. As the educational attainment and labor participation rate of women increases, their fertility rate is further suppressed. 

Finally, because developed economies have various retirement schemes, social safety nets, and third party elder care services, elderly people are less reliant on having adult children to provide for them, so having children becomes less of a life-or-death necessity. This is why advanced economies have below-replacement level fertility rates. 

All countries are rising up the socio-economic development scale at varying rates. European countries saw their fertility rates spike In the 19th century and crash in the 20th century. Asian countries saw their fertility rates spike in the 20th century and they are crashing now in the 21st century. African countries are spiking right now, and they are expected to crash in the coming century.",35d1c9c242d36de72dc30379e4c7a627,confirm_ham,hrpxqn,5f10ed874af4320009451f19

There are several examples of times when presidents or Presidential candidates haven't accepted the result of an election - Gore v. Bush for example, and the recounts and lawsuits over the ballots. Another example is Jill Stein contesting the 2016 election results with support from Hillary Clinton.

So yes, one possible reading of Trump's statement is ""I won't leave office peacefully,"" but a more reasonable interpretation is ""if the race is close I won't immediately concede the election"" which is legal, appropriate, and an action taken by both parties when dealing with a close election result.",5d51a79515159fc30e916d205dc24a31,confirm_ham,hu2rko,5f14edc14af4320009453c23

If they continue the refuse, he'd ask any number of other federal law enforcement agencies to escort the former president out of the building. 

If they all refuse, again, which they wouldn't, he would call the military because now he's annoyed and the former president is trying to stage a coup against the government of the United States. 

If the military refused, the coup was successful and we're fucked.

There's virtually zero chance we would ever get past step #1. The secret service would put Trump in a car, drive him to Andrews AFB, fly him wherever he wants to go, drive him to his destination, and be done with it. 

In the alternative, say Trump actually convinces people to question the legitimacy of the election and the chief justice is enjoined from or otherwise refuses to swear in the winner of the election, Trump's term is still up and he's out, so we start down the order of presidential succession. There's no VP, so the next active office in the line gets sworn in. Then they request the secret service remove Trump and we go through all the silliness above

>Heâ€™s a Grammy-winning musical genius. Heâ€™s a MAGA hat-wearing booster for President Trump. Wait, no â€” he took the hat off. But he still thinks Trump is pretty great. Westâ€™s music â€” sounding like an exposed nerve at times and a blood-slicked blade at others â€” has spoken to the black communityâ€™s triumphs and tragedies. Then he said that the 400 years of enslavement African Americans endured sounded â€œlike a choice.â€� He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He proudly does not take his prescribed medication.

...

>The mistake the media makes, added Ikpi â€” who is vocal about her own bipolar diagnosis â€” is divorcing Westâ€™s most grandiose and off-the-wall proclamations from mental health. Being bipolar amplifies oneâ€™s personality while also removing oneâ€™s filter. Itâ€™s not an excuse for Westâ€™s behavior, she added, but a reason for it. So, while heâ€™s telling Forbes magazine that vaccines are the â€œmark of the beastâ€� and Planned Parenthood does â€œthe Devilâ€™s work,â€� there should be a parallel conversation about his mental health.

>â€œIt contextualizes what he says and why heâ€™s saying it,â€� Ikpi said.

>At this point in the narrative, the question of whether the media can or should ignore West is almost irrelevant. The 43-year-old music and fashion mogul is one of the most famous people on the planet right now. Millions buy his shoes, listen to his music, hang on his every tweet. He has one of the loudest bullhorns on the globe. Add to that Kim Kardashian-Westâ€™s own political muscle in criminal justice reform. Add to that her familyâ€™s collective social media influence. And Westâ€™s reach goes even further.

>Whatâ€™s more, to sway the vote in certain battleground states, West doesnâ€™t need millions to write in his name, more like thousands, according to Woodbury. Eleven thousand votes in Michigan could change the color of that state in November. Six thousand people flocked to Westâ€™s Sunday Service concert in Detroit in September with less than a dayâ€™s notice.

>The voters West could sway are the â€œnone of the aboveâ€� cohort, said Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, who thinks Westâ€™s candidacy could help Trump.

>â€œTrumpâ€™s play is to make the election as messy as possible in the hope that heâ€™s got enough votes here and there,â€� Simmons said. â€œFor him, the more chaotic, the more likely people will choose not to participate. And if Kanye is telling people itâ€™s a mess and you canâ€™t trust either one of them, that is actually a Trump message.â€�",19d78b9526e86863c82874d36d70b948,confirm_ham,huke8e,5f15ab984af432000945406a

Maybe if you have ever visited and read the words emblazoned on it and then actually looked at the statue and the type of people it depicts *while also* reflecting on our states history that you readily admit is racist you might start to see the connection [others see quite clearly](https://cyclotram.blogspot.com/2009/01/promised-land.html) [Trigger warning if you hate progressives]. If you haven't seen the statue up close and instead need a better vetted source to back up my claim, [then here you go.](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-04-03-me-41677-story.html)

>  Also I liked the elk statue, didn't see any reason for it to be set on fire.

The Elk statue was [taken down by Portland City to avoid damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk_\(sculpture\)), it wasn't toppled like others were by protestors. They set fires around the base of the statue itself afterwards. This certainly doesn't mean it wouldn't have been damaged or toppled (erroneously) but don't mistake something the city did for something the protestors did.

> but I don't see how some jackasses fucking with them is a good thing. 

Because the people who reside in a city don't always get to help make the choice about what shit gets put up around town. Yea they might elect assholes who *do* go and put these statues up but a [lot of statues are donated or commissioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Statues_in_Portland,_Oregon) by groups that voters don't elect. Many of these statues have been in place for 40+ years and may not represent the sentiments or attitudes of the people who reside there today. Yea it *is* sort of shitty that they are being toppled through unofficial means, but I certainly don't blame them and ultimately - maybe more importantly - what the fuck skin do **you** have in it? Do you *actually* love these statues being torn down and care about them as much as the people toppling them **hate** them for making them feel excluded and unwelcome?

> I guess the mob gets to decide what statues we can and cannot have. What else do they get to determine?

The ""mob"" are the **people** of the city. The ""mob"" are the *majority* of the incredible City of Portland, Oregon. The ""mob"" never really got to vote on these statues in the first place either because of their age or because they were often not given a chance. Again, the ""mob"" are the fucking **people** of Portland showing what is important to them and what doesn't fucking matter at all. If you give a shit then go out and chain yourself to these statues you care so much about. Show the rest of Portland, and the world, that you have even HALF the guts of the people who have been out protesting week after week.

So you know what? The ""mob"" is making it clear they are not being heard and when elections come around, you can bet your ass they are going to get to determine what is best for the city because the ""mob"" are the **American people of Portland** showing the kind of activism our founders would be proud of (Boston Tea Party anyone?

approvecomment,"If you just read the headline you'd think the guy was just enjoying a nice, peaceful protest, decided to stroll up to the police while everything was nice and calm, and then the police beat the shit out of him because they're evil.  Watch the video and you see that he's approaching police that are actively trying to clear out an area, using gas and violence to do so.

I don't agree with the police use of force here; if it were up to me they'd be arrested and charged.  However it's not just some calm, summer stroll that ended in a beating like it seems many are making it out to be.  This is the issue I'm talking about.  Luckily we have a video here which seems to give good context, but I've seen plenty of ""they gassed peaceful protestors!"" threads on r/portland, with no context other than the people saying police moved in for no reason and on the other side the right wingers bitching about rioters, with no evidence to which side is more truthful.

Again I'm totally for police reform.  I'm a libertarian (like actual kind, not 'cool Republican' kind) and fully believe we need to do more to limit police and federal powers.  With mass surveillance becoming even cheaper and easier, shits going to be even more scary in the future.  If we can't come together and limit the state soon then I'm worried we won't have another real chance.  Things are already to the point of a Stasi wetdream, just takes enough political will to put it into action and we are all very fucked.  IMO we won't come together unless we can really get the truth out there.  The more we hide to make side A or B like good/bad, the more both sides are going to stay polarized.  The longer we stay separated and distrusting each other, the easier it will be for our government to push for invasive measures.

I still believe that West is motivated by something, possibly many things, up to and including doing what he can to support the president (whom he has proactively supported for years).

https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-long-lasting-violence-portland


There is editorializing throughout this entire piece.  Take, for instance, the author's account of what happened on the night of July 4:

>On July 4th, Portlandâ€™s thirty-ninth consecutive night of protests, more than a thousand people assembled in front of the Justice Center and Federal Courthouse downtown. They began launching dozens of commercial-grade fireworks into the concrete facades of both buildings, prompting a response from the police and federal agents inside both buildings. 

>What followed resembled nothing so much as a medieval siege. The windows of both government buildings had been covered in plywood weeks ago, after the first riots. Officers inside fired out through murder holes cut in the plywood, pumping rubber bullets, pepper balls and foam rounds into the crowd, while the crowd formed phalanxes of shield-bearers to protect the men and women launching fireworks back in response. Federal agents dumped tear gas into the street, but Portlandâ€™s frontline activists had long since lost their fear of gas. The feds and the police were eventually forced to sally out with batons to drive the crowd back. 

>I reported on the fighting in Mosul back in 2017, and what happened that night in the streets of Portland was, of course, not nearly as brutal or dangerous as actual combat. Yet it was about as close as you can get without using live ammunition. At times, dozens of flash-bangs and fireworks would detonate within feet of us over the course of a few minutes. My ears rang for days afterwards. My hands shook. I could not write for days.

>The whole situation prompted the first major federal response to Portlandâ€™s nightly protests. It started in the media, with CBP commissioner Mark Morgan going on Fox News to denounce local activists as â€œcriminals.â€� 

>    â€œThese are not protesters, these are criminals, who got together and actually brought weapons, they brought shields, they brought frozen water bottles, rocks, lasers, weapons with the intent to destroy a federal building and harm law enforcement officers.â€�

>I take some issue with this, because there was never any real chance of either the Federal Courthouse or the Justice Center being seriously damaged by fireworks. Both buildings are, at this stage in the protests, essentially fortresses. 


That whole spiel about medieval sieges is pure editorializing.  Apparently, the author also doesn't seem to like the fact the CBP commissioner Mark Morgan called the perpetrators of that night's violence ""criminals"" because ""there was never any real chance of either the Federal Courthouse or the Justice Center being seriously damaged by fireworks"".  That statement conveniently forgets the fact that those fireworks could have very easily hit the occupants of those buildings and seriously hurt or killed someone inside.

That's not the only instance of the author editorializing.  Near the end of the piece he calls out the DHS list of incidents in Portland as being misleading and says that "" the vast majority of the crimes he attributes to them are simple acts of vandalism"".  While he is right that the DHS is putting their own spin on the events in Portland (and that spin should be acknowledged), the author addresses the DHS's spin by putting his own spin on the events.  He completely ignores the incidents on the DHS list which aren't graffiti.  I'll copy and paste a few of those incidents below.

>Violent anarchists surrounded and blocked law enforcement from the area as extremists proceeded to attack police with thrown projectiles and large mortar style fireworks.

>Two Portland Police Bureau officers were injured by the crowd (possible concussion). 
>Portland Police Bureau took five into custody for directing lasers against aircraft.
>Violent anarchists set fires in front of Hatfield Courthouse and Chapman park.
>At the entrance of Hatfield Courthouse, Violent Anarchists fired large fireworks and threw other dangerous objects toward the entrance and the personnel protecting it.
>Violent anarchists assaulted construction crews by targeting them with fireworks while they repaired Hatfield Building.
>Violent anarchists held a â€œNight of Rage,â€� in which a 400-500-person protest devolved into riots, assaulting law enforcement officers and federal property.
>Approximately 200 violent anarchists began pursuing law enforcement officers to disrupt enforcement actions, assaulting them with rocks and bottles.
>Around 150 violent anarchists in front of the Justice Center began attacking personnel with lasers and peppered the area with fireworks.

These are some of the most serious accusations of violence that the DHS levies against their opponents in Portland.  The author doesn't address these accusations.  He doesn't make an effort to show why the DHS is wrong or is lying about these incidents.  The only time he seems to actually talk about them is in the section I copied above about the night of July 4, where he straight up says that he took issue with the characterization of the activities of July 4 being the actions of criminals.  Apparently launching fireworks at occupied buildings doesn't qualify as a criminal action to the author.

>But thus far, the only escalation seen recently has been the federal agents now roaming the streets of downtown Portland in rented vans, arresting activists seemingly at random. 

If this guy wants to call out police brutality, that's fine, but he shouldn't act like the protestors and rioters in Portland have the moral high ground when they are also engaging in violent behavior.  Protests can be done without having to resort to arson, vandalism, and launching fireworks at other people.  That sort of behavior does nothing to help their cause.  Because the author makes no effort to acknowledge that fact, I get the impression that he wrote this to be puff-piece editorial instead of an objective and even handed account of what is happening in Portland.",d6448b6561fde6457a8bc4fea3709ab5,confirm_ham,hv149r,5f171f144af4320009454b78

I don't know if there is a law requiring that officers should be able to be identified when they are making an arrest.  If there is one and it isn't being followed then that is wrong.  If there isn't a law stating that or something similar then I don't actually think it matters if the officers themselves are personally identifiable when the arrests are being made.

Original Comment:

As another commenter said, protecting the privacy of the arresting officers is the justification for the minimal personal ID on the officers.  The unmarked cars are used so that those cars are not specifically targeted by criminals.  If arrests are visible to the large mobs in Portland, then there is a very real chance that they will be violently interrupted.  

For whatever reason, local police have failed to protect/police federal property, so federal law enforcement agencies have been tasked with picking up the slack.  If the federal police abandon the area, then the vandalism and arson which is occurring around those federal properties will be allowed to happen unopposed.  Whatever the injustices perpetrated by the government and its various enforcement arms, there's no excuse for behavior like this.",d6448b6561fde6457a8bc4fea3709ab5,unspam,hvhcop,5f181fb84af432000945546e

That was definitely unexpected and refreshing really, almost makes one wonder if he's worried it would affect his reelection chances, since so many red states have been having a harder time than most with the pandemic. But in predictable Trumpian manner, he had to throw his two cents in:

>Still, he painted a mostly positive picture of the response to the pandemic, saying that the U.S. had produced ""thousands"" of ventilators per day and arguing that the American response had been ""better than most."" He also claimed that none of the 50 governors in the country ""need anything right now"" to address new outbreaks.

.

>Although where he is going with his shout-out to pedophile sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell is a mystery to me

Agree. The response he gave had flavors of ""Roger Stone can sleep well"" but, if I were to put on my mafioso hat (not well calibrated, see edit below) to interpret ""wishing her well,"" that sounds more like a send off than a good omen.

The census serves many, many purposes. For example, if youâ€™re an urban planner looking to upgrade a cityâ€™s wastewater treatment system and the census shows there are 100,000 residents in the city, youâ€™ll design a wastewater treatment system that can handle a nominal of 1,000 people all flushing at the same time, with a peak capacity of 10,000 people.  The system is supposed to run autonomously, unmanned, for the next 12 months.  It'll be examined 1 month before its end of life before it has to be revaluated.

But the census did not give you an accurate number.  Instead of 100,000 residents, there are an additional 10,000 residents that the census did not include, some are immigrants, some homeless, some not included for various reasons.

So your wastewater treatment system is constantly handling 1,100 people all flushing at the same time.  While it is within scope, it is slightly strained, the wear and tear are very slightly but insignificantly more.   By month 10 the system is near its life-end, but the routine inspection wasn't even scheduled.  Month 11 you go in to inspect the system.  The wastewater pipe spew a leak.

approvecomment,">Take the photographs here. It's clearly not just camouflaged body armor, but actual camouflaged clothing which is not part of their regular uniforms (source the podcast mentioned above)

What is their regular uniform?  I've searched the DHS website and I can't seem to find anything on uniform rules or regulations.  If they have a uniform policy that's been broken, then that should be addressed.  If they don't have a set of rules that govern what their uniforms should be, then I will ask again why does it matter if the uniforms are camouflaged?

>I'm sorry but it doesn't explain that because they are not performing CBP duties. There are cars parked illegally in Seattle, but the fact it is on the border wouldn't explain CBP being out ticketing cars. It wouldn't explain CBP investigating rapes or assaults unrelated to the border. We don't see CBP fighting regular federal crime in NYC or Houston. Again podcast source above for one stop source.

I've listened to the podcast in its entirety.  It is interesting, but the hosts don't say what the laws and court cases they are referencing are, so it is very hard to actually look them up and read them.  Getting to hear the perspective of some lawyers on these sorts of issues is nice, but without reading the laws, regulations, and court cases they reference then it is ultimately just an interesting podcast.

Regardless, I saying that the reason that CBP is out in Portland is because they've been given broad powers to do, essentially, whatever they want in terms of questioning and detaining people within that 100 mile radius.  Go to the ACLU link and look up the US law that it cites in the very first sentence of the first paragraph (8 U.S.C. Â§ 1357).  If you read that law you will find the following passage:

(5) to make arrestsâ€”
(A) for any offense against the United States, if the offense is committed in the officerâ€™s or employeeâ€™s presence, or
(B) for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States, if the officer or employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a felony,
if the officer or employee is performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest and if there is a likelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.

That's the authority that the CBP thinks it has.  That's the legal justification they use.  

>If I linked to an example of non-escalatory uniformed policing in English protests, would you accept it as proof that the police tactics here are clearly misguided?

If you linked to an example of police in another country employing non-escalatory tactics as a means of dealing with a situation similar anarchy in Portland then I would be more than willing to read about it, see how it could be utilized here, and change my view.  Is there something wrong with my Korea example?

>Because I have given ample examples, again podcast above is a good source for one thing to check, that this is not what the feds are doing in this case. I'm not asking you to defend every decision this administration is making, but you are broadly defending their actions whilst claiming to not support any of their specific acts.

I haven't claimed to not support any specific act.  I have always supported the decision to hide the identities of the arresting officers in Portland.  My support for that specific act has been in every one of my comments in this thread.  The whole reason that I've been telling you about my support for that specific act is because in your very first comment in this thread you asked why someone would support it (""What is the justification for the camouflaged gear, minimal identification, and unmarked cars, vs traditional community police?"").

>To restate - the administration has picked a fight with this city, ramped up the federal presence using extraordinary methods, and then is making political hay from the resulting clashes, and getting it splashed all over certain media outlets And using that to justify their actions of sending in agents in the first place. Violence created through escalation is being used to justify further escalation. 

What would you have the feds do?  Their courthouse is getting attacked every night.  People are trying to light fires on their barricades, people are attacking federal agents when they make arrests, and the local police departments have shown that they won't arrest the people committing these crimes.  Even if people are arrested, it seems like they'll just be immediately released anyways, as the links I've posted in my comments have shown.  Portland has been like this for 2 months now.  The feds started getting directly involved this month.

May as well petition to block facebook right? And a lot of major, national news networks.. and Twitter and Instagram and fuckin linkedin and literally anywhere ideas can be spread.. which is pretty much everything.

I signed cus why not, but I'm like 99.999% sure that petitioning to block the airing of one specific story on local television networks is 1. not gonna work and 2. arguably not worth the effort of the petition-makers. It's worth the effort of a signature cus it's just a signature but I honestly feel bad saying you're probably wasting your time.. and not the sort of ""probably wasting your time"" which can be refuted with ""well, it's worth a shot even if it's unlikely"".. no, I don't think this is even likely enough to be worth a shot.

It's just because it's not gonna do anything, you're trying to stop an idea from spreading and a petition won't do that at all. Ideas are transmitted through more than just local news broadcasts, they infect people from literally every angle you can think of. A petition won't stop that.

Now I'm putting a damper on your party but I really want you to know, I appreciate your effort and the sentiment behind it.

Instead of trying to censor shit like this and block it, we need to be doing proactive stuff like trying to reason with people that are susceptible to garbage bullshit conspiracy 'news' stories like this. 

Trying to stop an idea from spreading is insanely difficult, and a petition would just be a few speckles of piss in the wind. Instead of stopping the idea, you have to counter the idea with a better one. That's what needs to be done about shit like this.. not petitions.

Whoa, whoa. Pump the breaks, here. The federal government has the right to assist local law enforcement *at their request*. Otherwise, engaging federal forces - against the will of the local government - [is generally unconstitutional](https://www.justsecurity.org/71512/portlands-pretext-barrs-long-history-manipulating-law-to-put-federal-forces-on-u-s-streets/). The federal government does not police local crime, the federal government does not have justification or jurisdiction to do so.

The justification used here is that the federal officers are ""protecting federal functions"". So on a random day, if someone tries to break into the federal courthouse, he'll be arrested by federal Marshals and charged with a federal crime. However, that exception is *limited to its purpose*. So if Trump wants to post some people around the federal courthouse in Chicago, for example, so be it. If they witnesses other crimes taking place, they can initiate an arrest.

The devil is in the details, here. Having federal authorities on city streets making arrests for vandalism is not the ordinary course of business, even when protests are out of control.",5422f5e61e9b20fd44416323c7b4aa8f,confirm_ham,hwg5me,5f20c565ee857d0009960dde

approvecomment,">This is absolutely twisting the statistics. It claims that racist hate crimes qualify as right wing terrorist attacks. 

I mean, yes and no. The definition of right wing extremism/right wing terrorism does include white supremacist ideologies, but the definition is more complex than than that. Also, the authors arenâ€™t exactly making up this definition off the top of their heads, they drew from a variety of pre-existing definitions of right wing extremism, namely the way the government itself classifies it (as noted in both my quote below, and the sources the other commenter has provided). 

>This analysis focuses on terrorism: the deliberate useâ€”or threatâ€”of violence by non-state actors in order to achieve political goals and create a broad psychological impact. Violenceâ€”and the threat of violenceâ€”are important components of terrorism. Overall, this analysis divides terrorism into four broad categories: right-wing, left-wing, religious, and ethnonationalist. **To be clear, terms like right-wing and left-wing terrorism do notâ€”in any wayâ€”correspond to mainstream political parties in the United States, such as the Republican and Democratic parties, which eschew terrorism. Instead, terrorism is orchestrated by a small minority of extremists.**

*side note, you might want to look into the difference between right wing and left wing without comparing it to the current US political parties*. 

>**First, right-wing terrorism refers to the use or threat of violence by sub-national or non-state entities whose goals may include racial or ethnic supremacy; opposition to government authority; anger at women, including from the incel (â€œinvoluntary celibateâ€�) movement; and outrage against certain policies, such as abortion. This analysis uses the term â€œright-wing terrorismâ€� rather than â€œracially- and ethnically-motivated violent extremism,â€� or REMVE, which is used by some in the U.S. government.** Second, left-wing terrorism involves the use or threat of violence by sub-national or non-state entities that oppose capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism; pursue environmental or animal rights issues; espouse pro-communist or pro-socialist beliefs; or support a decentralized social and political system such as anarchism. Third, religious terrorism includes violence in support of a faith-based belief system, such as Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and Hinduism, among many others. As highlighted in the next section, the primary threat from religious terrorists comes from Salafi-jihadists inspired by the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. Fourth, ethnonationalist terrorism refers to violence in support of ethnic or nationalist goalsâ€”often struggles of self-determination and separatism along ethnic or nationalist lines.

>**In examining terrorism, this analysis does not specifically address several related phenomena. For example, it does not focus on hate crimes**. There is overlap between terrorism and hate crimes, since some hate crimes include the use or threat of violence.8 But hate crimes can also include non-violent incidents such as graffiti and verbal abuse. Hate crimes are obviously concerning and a threat to society, but this analysis concentrates only on terrorism and the useâ€”or threatâ€”of violence to achieve political objectives.


>Thatâ€™s the same as saying all gang shootings are left wing terrorist attacks because most intercity citizens are democrat.

Do â€œgangâ€� crimes often aim to achieve political goals or have a political motive? Because absent of that, itâ€™s not what theyâ€™re discussing in this report.",03bfabfcc8b989cee48257c071b21640,confirm_ham,hyubiw,5f20d5ccee857d0009960e76

Thereâ€™s a line that they are crossing in order to intentionally create further chaos which I believe is part of a larger agenda for the current administration. If the point is to calm the situation..... they arenâ€™t accomplishing that. Also there is a greater point that the federal government isnâ€™t supposed to send troops into American cities without being asked by the mayor and governor.

I would agree that the main article is unnecessarily inflammatory since all they ruled was the process to remove it was flawed. (Though the SC did specifically say Duke's decision was arbitrary and capricious).

And quoted section:

> Acting Secretary Dukeâ€™s rescission memorandum failed to consider important aspects of the problem before the agency. Although
Duke was bound by the Attorney Generalâ€™s determination that DACA
is illegal, see 8 U. S. C. Â§1103(a)(1), deciding how best to address that
determination involved important policy choices reserved for DHS.
Acting Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretionary authority
in winding down the program, but she did not appreciate the full scope
of her discretion. The Attorney General concluded that the legal defects in DACA mirrored those that the courts had recognized in DAPA.
The Fifth Circuit, the highest court to offer a reasoned opinion on
DAPAâ€™s legality, found that DAPA violated the INA because it extended eligibility for benefits to a class of unauthorized aliens. But the
defining feature of DAPA (and DACA) is DHSâ€™s decision to defer removal, and the Fifth Circuit carefully distinguished that forbearance
component from the associated benefits eligibility. Eliminating benefits eligibility while continuing forbearance thus remained squarely
within Dukeâ€™s discretion. Yet, rather than addressing forbearance in
her decision, Duke treated the Attorney Generalâ€™s conclusion regarding the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both benefits and
forbearance, without explanation. That reasoning repeated the error
in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc.
v. State Farmâ€” treating a rationale that applied to only part of a policy
as sufficient to rescind the entire policy. 463 U. S. 29, 51. While DHS was not required to â€œconsider all policy alternatives,â€� ibid., deferred
action was â€œwithin the ambit of the existingâ€� policy, ibid.; indeed, it
was the centerpiece of the policy. In failing to consider the option to
retain deferred action, Duke â€œfailed to supply the requisite â€˜reasoned
analysis.â€™ â€� Id., at 57.
That omission alone renders Dukeâ€™s decision arbitrary and capricious, but it was not the only defect. Duke also failed to address
whether there was â€œlegitimate relianceâ€� on the DACA Memorandum.
Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742. Certain
features of the DACA policy may affect the strength of any reliance
interests, but those features are for the agency to consider in the first
instance. DHS has flexibility in addressing any reliance interests and
could have considered various accommodations. While the agency was
not required to pursue these accommodations, it was required to assess
the existence and strength of any reliance interests, and weigh them
against competing policy concerns. Its failure to do so was arbitrary
and capricious. Pp. 17â€“26.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER,
and JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that respondentsâ€™ claims fail
to establish a plausible inference that the rescission was motivated by
animus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth
Amendment. Pp. 27â€“29.",5cad675fe5861a585bd6bd6c6b7a3307,URL shortener or image hosting site,i00tfi,5f219605ee857d00099615ad

As it is, [people like Nadler already pretend that antifa violence is a ""myth](https://nypost.com/2020/07/27/jerry-nadler-calls-violence-from-antifa-in-portland-a-myth/)"", which is absurd.

The problem is in how antifa is defined. Some people still say that somehow antifa isn't real. Some say that it isn't an organized group, but made up of thousands of random individuals like a hivemind (despite the facts that [they have actual recruitment websites](https://www.rosecityantifa.org/) and [coordinated attacks on police](https://www.dailywire.com/news/watch-chicago-police-release-video-of-antifa-using-protest-as-cover-changing-to-all-black-arming-against-cops) that prove otherwise).

It's obvious by nature of the act, but no legal definitive proof in most cases.

With the rise in hate crimes towards white people and Trump supporters, logic would assume that these acts are being done by blm and antifa supporters. At what point does an antifa ""supporter"" attacking police and Trump fans become a legitimate ""anti-fascist""?

is illegal, see 8 U. S. C. Â§1103(a)(1), deciding how best to address that
determination involved important policy choices reserved for DHS.
Acting Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretionary authority
in winding down the program, but she did not appreciate the full scope
of her discretion. The Attorney General concluded that the legal defects in DACA mirrored those that the courts had recognized in DAPA.
The Fifth Circuit, the highest court to offer a reasoned opinion on
DAPAâ€™s legality, found that DAPA violated the INA because it extended eligibility for benefits to a class of unauthorized aliens. But the
defining feature of DAPA (and DACA) is DHSâ€™s decision to defer removal, and the Fifth Circuit carefully distinguished that forbearance
component from the associated benefits eligibility. Eliminating benefits eligibility while continuing forbearance thus remained squarely
within Dukeâ€™s discretion. Yet, rather than addressing forbearance in
her decision, Duke treated the Attorney Generalâ€™s conclusion regarding the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both benefits and
forbearance, without explanation. That reasoning repeated the error
in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc.
v. State Farmâ€” treating a rationale that applied to only part of a policy
as sufficient to rescind the entire policy. 463 U. S. 29, 51. While DHS was not required to â€œconsider all policy alternatives,â€� ibid., deferred
action was â€œwithin the ambit of the existingâ€� policy, ibid.; indeed, it
was the centerpiece of the policy. In failing to consider the option to
retain deferred action, Duke â€œfailed to supply the requisite â€˜reasoned
analysis.â€™ â€� Id., at 57.
That omission alone renders Dukeâ€™s decision arbitrary and capricious, but it was not the only defect. Duke also failed to address
whether there was â€œlegitimate relianceâ€� on the DACA Memorandum.
Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742. Certain
features of the DACA policy may affect the strength of any reliance
interests, but those features are for the agency to consider in the first
instance. DHS has flexibility in addressing any reliance interests and
could have considered various accommodations. While the agency was
not required to pursue these accommodations, it was required to assess
the existence and strength of any reliance interests, and weigh them
against competing policy concerns. Its failure to do so was arbitrary
and capricious. Pp. 17â€“26.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER,
and JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that respondentsâ€™ claims fail
to establish a plausible inference that the rescission was motivated by
animus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth
Amendment. Pp. 27â€“29.",5cad675fe5861a585bd6bd6c6b7a3307,unspam,i00tfi,5f21dfd0ee857d00099619e1

You seem to have missed my original comment so I have included it above. The only claim I made (and sourced with a quote from the article) was that the writer included the fact that the person who was arrested was trans. I then asked two questions. Why does it matter? And does it contribute to the article?

You answered me saying yes it does matter, didn't cite anything that supported your claim and then told me to prove that it doesn't. I don't think you quite understand how the burden of proof works. 

Did my questions really make you that uncomfortable?

removecomment,"No, they are on duty for this stuff.  They don't hire officers, they 'hire' the police department.  Basically, they say ""hey we need some security for this event, we believe there is credible risk of blah blah blah"", or something to that effect, then the department invoices them whatever amount it will be (and it is typically expensive, as such extra duties tend to have either base pay well above normal salary for an officer, or the officers will be racking up overtime for the duration.) and that's that.  Whether there is any sort of negotiation as to how many officers are deployed or if that is something where the department states that they need x number of officers to do the job and there is no negotiation, I do not know in this particular case.  

However there are some events (such as some: parades, sporting events, conventions, concerts, etc) where getting a permit to perform the event is conditional on x number of constables and y number of supervisors and z number of vehicles is required for the police to fulfill the security role, and then the event organizers are on the hook for that^(1).  In this sort of set up, the officers are technically off duty, however they are beholden to the same standards of conduct and performance as if they were on duty.

At least, that is how I understand this sort of thing to be.  Admittedly, my actual knowledge of the specifics is limited to Canada, and there is also far less variation^2 in how things are done from province to province when compared to how much variance there is between states.  However given the nature of the event in question and the fact that there is negotiation over what the acceptable crowd control methods are it is likely that this is a case of contracting the department.

Now, it's true that this still isn't the same as what the OP has posted, but there's no way for us to know if there are any other edits in the article's history. What happens for the mods, is there's some leeway for the titles not to be exact by measuring the distance between the posted title and the titles visible in the article's html. This can allow for slight misspellings, punctuation changes, slight context additions, or word substitution.

It's astonishing to me the disconnect that the general public has with what is currently procedurally happening in Washington. But then humans will often act against their own best interests. The Easter Islanders destroyed themselves too.

> Protesters in support of Black Lives Matter once again rallied near the federal courthouse that became a flashpoint, and the scene of nightly battles amid the swirl of tear gas, after Donald Trump dispatched agents to end what he called anarchy in the city after weeks of demonstrations.

> But in the absence of the federal officers, Thursday nightâ€™s protest passed off without major incident or intervention by the police.

> On Wednesday, Oregonâ€™s governor, Kate Brown, agreed with the White House that the state police would take over responsibility for guarding the courthouse after weeks of escalating protests. She said that â€œTrumpâ€™s troopsâ€� were behaving like an occupying army in Portland and provoking unrest with heavy-handed tactics.

> In contrast, the state troopers did not intervene even when the scale of the protest on Thursday night passed the point, as demonstrators shook the fence around the courthouse, at which in early demonstrations the federal agents generally fired tear gas, stun grenades and baton rounds.

While I don't agree with rioting as an effective method , it's worth thinking about being  part of a community that feels marginalized and ignored and to see hard evidence this is leading to the law working in different ways for those disinfranchised including resultimg in death for those in that community.

The trigger lock is simple. It locks over the trigger so that the trigger cannot be pulled. You can still keep the gun loaded in a closet (or unloaded if you prefer) but a kid is unable to do any harm, accidental or on purpose.

The other one, the cable lock is similar in that it [locks the gun open](https://images.app.goo.gl/aFuF12Vt24DLoFbT9) this means the gun cannot fully close, ensuring a round cannot be chambered, nor fired unless removed.

approvecomment,"Personally, I'm much less worried about the person walking around with a gun at their hip than the person walking with one concealed in a hoodie illegally, and the latter is much more difficult to detect. I'm sure most police would also agree, even the racist ones.

Also, people with concealed carry permits tend to commit fewer crimes. A lot of this is the background check and registration, but part of it is probably the mandatory gun safety class.

But yeah, fear is counter-productive and often results in escalation of force. However, we can choose how to direct police to respond to it. By default, they'll probably respond with more fear, which is bad, but police *should* respond with more openness and training.

Edit: R2 - [here's a Daily Wire article about crimes committed by the general public, police, and concealed carry permit holders](https://www.dailywire.com/news/report-concealed-carry-permit-holders-are-most-law-aaron-bandler).

Ouch. That is a rather choice word selection there.

Per capita? Or because there are far less people with concealed carry permits versus the general population? I would appreciate a Rule 2 there for that claim. You don't seem so sure of it yourself for why that is.

> we can choose how to direct police to respond to it

""We"" can? How? I generally agree there needs to be more deescalation training, that we put too much on officers to deal with, and that we don't give them appropriate downtime from what is an extremely stressful job. While I do not agree with everything [Jocko Willink says in his visit to Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUhdc1GAddk) in his analysis of policing in the US and the ""Defund"" movement (I believe he has his own blind spots for social work), he does make some good points.",fae191b67c5299841aefe5a84b442ddb,confirm_ham,i38x2w,5f29966cee857d0009966159
approvecomment,"OK, I took the hoodie comment for subtly implying a stereotypical ""black thug"" or other generalization, especially when juxtaposed against the ""open carry"" stereotype -- white and privileged in their ability to open carry without issue or retaliation by law enforcement.

So a hoodie is more than just a piece of clothing. It can be interpreted as a symbol of something -- or [a dog whistle](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/dog-whistle-political-meaning). But I will give you the benefit of the doubt.

Daily Wire tends to lean right on issues.  It's not as bad as Brietbart, but you need good media literacy to parse its bias. It is also not what I would consider a high-quality source given its founder: Ben Shapiro is a watered-down Fox News-style pundit. Ben made a name for himself on YouTube doing debates where he punched down on ignorant left-leaning college kids. The students who attended his sessions weren't prepared to deal with someone as experienced as Ben and made bad arguments; even the good arguments Ben would use rhetorical tricks or other methods to appear ""right."" It was like an NBA team playing against a high school basketball team.

Ben is a pro, and I was initially smitten with his style, but he withers under scrutiny. I don't think I have seen Ben engaged in an honest debate outside his US conservative media echo chamber where he puts himself and his positions at risk... except once, and it gave his entire game away.

EDIT: I tried to find more info on the Andy Ngo events.  The man made a career out of trying to convince the public that Antifa was the Big Bad all along and his claims were repeatedly debunked.

1. [Good summary of his career](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/andy-ngo-right-wing-troll-antifa-877914/)
2. [No evidence that anyone, let alone Ngo, was hit with a cement milkshake](https://www.wweek.com/news/courts/2019/07/10/is-it-possible-to-mix-cement-into-a-vegan-milkshake-we-did-it/)
3. [Ngo made unsubstantiated claims that Antifa was going to ""converge on El Paso"" for a military training exercise which ultimately turned into the conspiracy theory that the Far Right mass shooting in El Paso was an Antifa operation](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/08/03/analysis/far-right-targets-immigration-activists-after-deadly-el-paso-shooting)
4.

If you honestly believe that then it throws your KKK argument out the window.  Maybe they aren't actually declining in numbers but de-centralizing to avoid repercussions.

> Are you arguing that ANTIFA is not violent?

If you are acknowledging that there isn't an ""ANTIFA"" then how can you prescribe violence to them?  Some people that are anti-fascist may be getting violent but not all anti-fascists are violent.

removecomment,"So, a couple of things.

First, there is [no ANTIFA organization](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/06/11/what-is-antifa-trump-protests).  There are smaller groups who have adopted the term Antifa into their name but they aren't affiliated with each other or some bigger organization.  So there is no organization to designate anything, unlike the KKK that do have a nationally recognized organization.

Second, in your arson link, the only mentions of ANTIFA are in quotes by Trump and Barr.  No one claiming to be antifa claims responsibility for those arsons.  It appears to just be some pissed off individuals lashing out in the only way they know how.  Or opportunists just looking to burn shit.  Your ""beating reporters"" link is pay walled but seeing how its an opinion piece I don't imagine it has anything too damning.  However a quick look at [Andy Ngo's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ngo) reveals some info i personally found enlightening:

> **Andy Cuong NgÃ´** (born c.â€‰1986) is an American conservative social media activist[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ngo#cite_note-Buzzfeed-2) and journalist[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ngo#cite_note-:5-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ngo#cite_note-:6-4) best known for covering street protests in [Portland, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon). He is editor at large of [*The Post Millennial*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Post_Millennial), a Canadian conservative news website. **Ngo received national attention in June 2019 when he was assaulted by unidentified assailants who appeared to be** [**antifa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_(United_States)) **protesters while covering a counter protest to a** [**Proud Boys**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Boys) **march in Portland, and later due to alleged connections with the far-right groups** [**Patriot Prayer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Prayer) **and Proud Boys.** 

The emphasis is mine.  We could spend days going over the details but the fact that he was attacked while covering (probably favorably based on his connections) a white supremacist rally reveals that his attack was likely a mistake at best, instigated at worst.

removecomment,"I think its bizare to think that we can go from a system where we all buy newspapers to one where we read the news for free and not expect a drop in quality. News agencies warned us this would happen. We need to look beyond news as a profit driven exercise and look for an alternative. Also, this comment section is a graveyard so I don't think the mods like people talking about the neutrality and accuracy of certain sources in here for some reason. I think the socialization of news, whether it be Facebook or Reddit, and the power of a few moderators of those communities is a major part of this growing attitude of our news system being fundamentally broken.

Personally I have a hardening attitude against media because it is either becoming less accurate and more corporate (due to funding issues) or those inaccurate statements more often become news themselves than in the past. Either way this is an issue that needs reflecting on not only by us plebs, but by people making and editing news stories, and the platforms that they now come to us through. 

Stories like this that seem defensive about being called out for lying more often these days do not help the credibility of the news media either. I trust  AP, but the issue is with more editorialized outlets, and the increasingly blurred line between fact and opinion (and for that matter opinion and corporate interest).",70ed3b19e9b825cee2b6db818a511367,remove,i3uttm,5f2afd04ee857d0009966dbd

As an example Bernie Sanders is only ever called â€œleftl in comparison to a Democrat, otherwise he is labelled â€œprogressiveâ€� or â€œliberalâ€�. Likewise Ted Cruz is almost always branded a â€œconservativeâ€� unless he is put in comparison to Romney or McConnel. 

I think the problem people on the right are having is that â€œright-leaning viewsâ€� arenâ€™t being discussed in a serious fashion in the same way that â€œleft leaning viewsâ€� arenâ€™t being discussed in a serious fashion.

I am. I'm not quite sure what argument you're defending. I'm not arguing his lawsuit.

>The National Rifle Association (NRA) is an American corporate shill political action group that has sold more guns than Sam Colt and Bill Ruger.[4] Originally (until the 1977 Revolt on Cincinnati[5]) it functioned as a relatively moderate organisation,[6] sometimes said to focus on rifle marksmanship and not even mentioning the Second Amendment or gun laws (although the latter has been disputed).[7] The History News Network has stated that once, at least from the 1930s, they basically concern-trolled about ""bad"" and ""unreasonable"" gun laws while presenting themselves as supporters of ""reasonable"" firearms controls and fear mongering about the â€œattempted dictation of anti-gun cranks and pacifists who are â€˜out to outlaw firearmsâ€™â€�, thus watering down much proposed gun legislation.[8][9] But... the NRA no longer represents hunters and collectors, having been taken over by investment groups which own large percentages of most firearms/ammo companies.[10][11] Not surprisingly, it promotes ownership of guns in the United States at all costs (as long as the industry receives your costs of course), has a knee-jerk reaction against the most mild proposals for gun-control legislation, or even against the enforcement of existing gun laws.

>They are not well known for teaching their members how to properly debate (shout at) proponents of increased gun control, and as a result, most NRA members resort to clichÃ©s such as ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"", ""the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy/woman/toddler(?)[12][13] with a gun"",[note 1] and other empty platitudes. Their ultimate goal is to bring about a world where it's socially acceptable to be armed at all times,[15][16] and if a ""citizen"" circling your neighborhood with a boomstick makes you uncomfortable, you're a cuck who hates freedom.[17] (Of course, if it was a good black guy doing the same thing with the same motive, the situation would be handled much differently.)[18] Achieving a world where everyone is armed at all times is to have everyone buy guns, hence the NRA pushes hard for unrestricted gun-ownership.",19d78b9526e86863c82874d36d70b948,remove,i4ucjp,5f2c8b73ee857d0009967a16

> Trump: I havenâ€™t spoken to the post office about it, but I donâ€™t know how they could possibly be prepared.

Maybe start by talking to the Post Office, and ensuring they are prepared...

> There are also concerns that a top Trump donor now running the Postal Service is cutting costs right before the election in a way that will make the job even harder.

Well that explains why Trump wouldn't want to confirm they will be prepared.


> Trump: ""Floridaâ€™s a very well-run state. Low taxes, low everything. Theyâ€™ve done a great job, really, a great job. And the two governors between the both of them, theyâ€™ve really got a great system of absentee ballots. And even in the case of mail-in ballots, the Postal Services are built up there.""

> Trump is suggesting that policies, like tax rates, affect how elections are run. Also, â€œthe Postal Services are built up thereâ€� makes no sense. Why would the U.S. Postal Service operate better in Florida than any other state?

Just blathering, but in a dangerous, ""sacrifice future confidence in American democracy to protect my ego"" kind of way. Trump is strip mining democracy for short term personal benefit. In a few years he'll be dead, and other generations will be doing the work to recover and rebuild trust in government.

Meanwhile, what's the payoff for his supporters? Tax cuts for rich people? A bit of a wall? Pardons for Trumps friends who have done nothing for Americans?",38e2216dc3dc2cb196cbf4bab0d83541,confirm_ham,i46ep0,5f2cb34bee857d0009967b92

That means **the science has been changing because more experiments have been run and better models have been developed.**

Science around surgical masks was pretty decent as of March, but the problem was just that it was focused on droplet spread in a surgical suite and not in everyday use. For example, you technically aren't supposed to talk in a surgical suite because the moisture your talking emits breaks down the barrier faster so it's no longer at the spec of a surgical suite.

...well, turns out when you have an infectious pandemic your goals change from *zero* droplet transmission to *lowering it as much as you can* in a larger variety of use-cases.

The future of the Republican party isn't looking too bright with these highly controversial officials winning elections. 

Just a couple of years ago, accused child molester Roy Moore won a Republican primary, got [endorsed by Donald](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568274917/removing-any-qualifications-trump-endorses-roy-moore), and then [lost a Senate seat to Democrat Doug Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZRumh4HQxM). Now there's Greene, who's likely going to make it to Congress, where she'll be able to showcase her inflammatory views on the national stage and indicate to all American voters that the GOP is the party of racists and conspiracy theorists.

The GOP establishment realizes that people like this scare away voters, especially since our country is becoming more and more racially and ethnically diverse, as well as more educated.

[Early Benchmarks Show â€˜Post-Millennialsâ€™ on Track to Be Most Diverse, Best-Educated Generation Yet](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/11/15/early-benchmarks-show-post-millennials-on-track-to-be-most-diverse-best-educated-generation-yet/)

>A new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data finds that the â€œpost-Millennialâ€� generation is already the most racially and ethnically diverse generation, as a bare majority of 6- to 21-year-olds (52%) are non-Hispanic whites. And while most are still pursuing their K-12 education, the oldest post-Millennials are enrolling in college at a significantly higher rate than Millennials were at a comparable age.

The GOP knows that the long-term health of their party is in serious jeopardy if they don't appeal to more types of voters, so they're fighting - meekly - against folks like Greene. But at the moment, it isn't working.

>  
>â€œIf Republicans want to win in 2020, they need to listen the message that Iâ€™m speaking,"" Greene told cheering supporters in a victory speech that railed against â€œspineless Republicansâ€� and â€œanti-American leftists.â€� Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she said: â€œWeâ€™re going to kick that b - - - - out of Congress.â€�.

The NRA has long supported the regulation of fire arms. One NRA president testified that ""I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons. I seldom carry one. ... I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses"" in favor of the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the NRA continued to support regulation through the Gun Control Act of 1968. 

The over politicized gun themed propaganda machine now known as the NRA is a huge bastardization of the organization and a shame.

I have no idea if thatâ€™s right. I would have assumed that the Democrats would have checked that out.â€� â€” news conference Thursday.

> THE FACTS: Harris, a senator from California, is without question eligible.

Trump made no statements here to fact check. He basically said, ""I'm aware of the claims, I don't know."" 

> TRUMP CAMPAIGN: â€œNot long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received.â€� -- statement Tuesday from Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 senior adviser.

> THE FACTS: She never called Biden a racist.

She heavily implied he was a racist. ""you're not a racist but you seem to really admire these racists"". This would be enough for many liberals to call someone a racist and people got that implication at the time which is why it was such a notable line from the debates. Technically she didn't call him a racist but she attacked him viciously on his race record. There were reports during the VP selection process that Biden went to here seeking an apology and she brushed him off. Obviously there's something there if Biden wants an apology. That sequence of events is omitted from the article.

""THE FACTS"" are literally just repeating what Trump said. So I guess he gets a ""100% true"" checkmark on that?

The great â€” the great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing, where they lost, anywhere from 50 to 100 million people. Probably ended the Second World War; all the soldiers were sick.â€� â€” news briefing Monday.

> THE FACTS: He got the year wrong for the Spanish flu, as he routinely does, and may have overstated deaths from it. The pandemic spread from early 1918 to late 1920. It killed an estimated 50 million worldwide, with about 675,000 of the deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

> That pandemic did not end World War II, which came two decades later.

He's off by one on the year, was accurate (as far as I can tell?) on the deaths yet they still bring it up and clearly mis-spoke on which world war it was.


You see how, with the first question, they have to read into the statement and imply what he meant to call him a birther and yet, on the last question, they take everything he says super literally so they can call him wrong as much as possible? If you were to flip the strategies on those two question, he's telling the truth on both. That's the bias.

That's what bias looks like. There's zero consistency in the philosophy of the fact checker in what qualifies as a lie except to maximize the amount of lies found.

I'm a guy looking for a news source that approaches things that way (not hypothetically, I really am) and I don't know where to look. Trump lies a shitload.

> TRUMP, asked about social media claims that Harris is not eligible to run for vice president because her parents were immigrants to the U.S.: â€œI heard it today that she doesnâ€™t meet the requirements. ... I have no idea if thatâ€™s right. I would have assumed that the Democrats would have checked that out.â€� â€” news conference Thursday.

> THE FACTS: Harris, a senator from California, is without question eligible.

Trump made no statements here to fact check. He basically said, ""I'm aware of the claims, I don't know."" 

> TRUMP CAMPAIGN: â€œNot long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received.â€� -- statement Tuesday from Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 senior adviser.

> THE FACTS: She never called Biden a racist.

She heavily implied he was a racist. ""you're not a racist but you seem to really admire these racists"". This would be enough for many liberals to call someone a racist and people got that implication at the time which is why it was such a notable line from the debates. Technically she didn't call him a racist but she attacked him viciously on his race record. There were reports during the VP selection process that Biden went to here seeking an apology and she brushed him off. Obviously there's something there if Biden wants an apology. That sequence of events is omitted from the article.

""THE FACTS"" are literally just repeating what Trump said. So I guess he gets a ""100% true"" checkmark on that?

> THE FACTS: He got the year wrong for the Spanish flu, as he routinely does, and may have overstated deaths from it. The pandemic spread from early 1918 to late 1920. It killed an estimated 50 million worldwide, with about 675,000 of the deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

> That pandemic did not end World War II, which came two decades later.

He's off by one on the year, was accurate (as far as I can tell?) on the deaths yet they still bring it up and clearly mis-spoke on which world war it was.


You see how, with the first question, they have to read into the statement and imply what he meant to call him a birther and yet, on the last question, they take everything he says super literally so they can call him wrong as much as possible? If you were to flip the strategies on those two question, he's telling the truth on both. That's the bias.

That's what bias looks like. There's zero consistency in the philosophy of the fact checker in what qualifies as a lie except to maximize the amount of lies found.

I'm a guy looking for a news source that approaches things that way (not hypothetically, I really am) and I don't know where to look. Trump lies a shitload. More than enough to fill this article yet they feel the need to exaggerate the slightest missteps or exaggerations which allows people to dismiss the _entire_ article as bias because they don't know which points they can trust when they read through a few that are obviously pedantic/biased/etc.",8fb4b20b9ee5b05a4464e6f777832f71,remove,ia7d83,5f38aa94ee857d000996e84a

The difficulties of death figures
This table aims to provide a complete picture on the topic, but it very much relies on data that has become more difficult to compare.

>If you want to say the Democrats could have done more, I might agree with you, but the idea that both are equally complicit is a poor one. One party was actively pushing for this change, the other had other priorities. Not the same, not even close.

If you take a look at the ""priorities"" that superseded saving, arguably, the most important public utility that has been around since 1774 (older than the US itself)... you start to see where your argument seems laughable. 

It's worth noting when looking up some of the things that were held as ""priorities"" over helping the USPS that Obama also wrote ""[Presidential Memorandums](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/16/obama-presidential-memoranda-executive-orders/20191805/)"" that were considered to hold similar power as EO's.

https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/#
>Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Once more deliberately vague language, still no clue of what an assault weapon is. Must be trying to stop mass shootings. To bad only 25% are committed with rifles. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States



>the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that donâ€™t limit the weaponâ€™s lethality.

It's a fucking gun. It is supposed to be as lethal as possible. 

>Both candidates support programs to divert mental health calls away from police and first responders, and both propose partnering mental health specialists with police. 

I hope they're not thinking of just sending out a social worker on mental health calls. It's a dangerous situation for first responders and it'll be dangerous for them, too. 

Both are paid like shit, too, as an aside.

approvecomment,"I see what you're saying, but I see that approach as fundamentally addressing the symptoms of systemic racism, rather than the root cause. You seem to be confining the term ""racism"" to ""A person or organization explicitly stating their intent is to discriminate by race"". Realistically, this just isn't how most common racism is perpetuated in our society. Allow me to quote the Republican Strategist Lee Atwater when discussing the Southern Strategy:

""You start out in 1954 by saying, ""Nigger, nigger, nigger"". By 1968 you can't say ""nigger""â€”that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow meâ€”because obviously sitting around saying, ""We want to cut this"", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than ""Nigger, nigger"". So, any way you look at it, race is coming on the back-burner.""

Much of the most damaging modern day racism is explicitly designed to appear non-racist. So my hesitation with denying even calling racism by it's name, is you eliminate it from being an explanation and subsequently play right into the hand of those who are designing racist policies.",a8b8209731c82e714159d8276a65f399,confirm_ham,ib12pg,5f3b4560f32e7900092bf6bf

So my hesitation with denying even calling racism by it's name, is you eliminate it from being an explanation and subsequently play right into the hand of those who are designing racist policies.

You provide no sources for your claims.

Let's assume, however, for the sake of argument that most racism is designed to appear non-racist. 

It simply doesn't matter.  We can never stop racist thoughts from everyone.  All we can do is ensure what the law says and that racist action doesn't happen.

 If racist action is illegal, and we agree the problem from previous racist action is, for example Generational Poverty, or the [Cycle of Poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_of_poverty) and we then put policies in place to help *everyone* in those circumstances regardless of race using strict objective measurements, then we have removed the ability to use race as a tool to deny the aid.  It's a black and white answer of ""were policies followed to the letter""

For policies, they are created by duly elected politicians.  If the people don't think their objective measures of good enough, then it can be campaigned to be changed.  By keeping it neutral and not at all race-based, you won't foster resentment by saying one race needs help while another one is also in the same cycle of poverty.  You just ask and answer the question of if the metrics are enough to help break the cycle and it helps *everyone* in that situation.

But the simple fact of the matter is that we can never, ever achieve MLK's [Dream](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm) if we continue to make decisions based on the color of someone's skin.  Every time you justify an action based on the color of skin, you lend power to others to justify other actions -- including ones you might not like -- based on the color of skin.

  That is a vicious cycle, and the only way to break it is to stop it completely and say it is ***never*** okay do do something based on the color of someone's skin.  You completely remove it as justistification.  [White Only](https://americanhistory.si.edu/brown/history/1-segregated/white-only-1.html) and [Black Only](https://disrn.com/news/video-shows-black-only-segregated-areas-within-chaz) are equally bad and shouldn't be done -- Not because the material harm that can be measured, but because the immeasurable harm that comes from reducing anyone down to their skin color and granting or denying them something based on that.",73d03c2bf48d94c118a0ba7d4700e105,confirm_ham,ib12pg,5f3c4e37f32e7900092c009f

Here is the super short summary:

* Russians were actively trying to find access into the campaign, but mostly unsuccessfully, except for Manafort whose conduct is certainly very problematic and suspicous, but even there it's unclear how much if any impact it had on anything
* Trump and the campaign welcomed DNC leaks but there is no evidence of any collusion or any prior to knowledge (or in fact any knowledge that the leaks were done by Russans)
* Trump's team did reach out to Roger Stone to learn more about the leaks, and if more were coming, but it's unclear if he actually had any access or if they learnt anything through that
* Few of the meetings were investigated but didn't produce any smoking guns 
* There is a criticism of FBI conduct including not cooperating with DNC and taking Steele's dossier at face value

> * The president has tried to turn DHS, the nationâ€™s largest law enforcement agency, into a tool used for his political benefit. He insisted on a near-total focus on issues that he said were central to his reelection â€” in particular building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Though he was often talked out of bad ideas at the last moment, the president would make obviously partisan requests of DHS, including when he told us to close the California-Mexico border during a March 28, 2019, Oval Office meeting â€” it would be better for him politically, he said, than closing long stretches of the Texas or Arizona border â€” or **to â€œdumpâ€� illegal immigrants in Democratic-leaning sanctuary cities and states to overload their authorities, as he insisted on several times**.

> * Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced, at the White Houseâ€™s urging, a â€œzero toleranceâ€� policy to prosecute anyone who crossed the border illegally. The agencies involved were unprepared to implement the policy, causing a disastrous backlog of detentions that ultimately left migrant parents and their children separated. Incredibly, after this ill-conceived operation was rightly halted, in the following months the president repeatedly exhorted DHS officials to restart it and to implement a more deliberate policy of **pulling migrant families apart en masse**, so that adults would be deterred from coming to the border for fear of losing their children. The president was visibly furious on multiple occasions when my boss, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, refused.

> * Top DHS officials were regularly diverted from dealing with genuine security threats by the chore of responding to these inappropriate and often absurd executive requests, at all hours of the day and night. One morning it might be a demand to shut off congressionally appropriated funds to a foreign ally that had angered him, and that evening it might be a **request to sharpen the spikes atop the border wall so theyâ€™d be more damaging to human flesh (â€œHow much would that cost us?â€�)**. Meanwhile, Trump showed vanishingly little interest in subjects of vital national security interest, including cybersecurity, domestic terrorism and malicious foreign interference in U.S. affairs.

> **By retweeting material that the** ***US government has already labeled as propaganda*** -- and doing so with the 2020 Democratic National Convention kicking off on Monday -- **Trump demonstrated once again that he is willing to capitalize on foreign election meddling for his own political gain**.

> There is no proof of wrongdoing on the tapes of Biden and Poroshenko. But Trump and his allies, as well as Kremlin-controlled media outlets, have used the tapes to foment conspiracies about Biden's dealings with Ukraine.

...

> The recordings are of Biden's dealings with Poroshenko, the former Ukrainian President, and they appear authentic. But the material reinforces Biden's claims that he promoted US interests and didn't do anything improper in Ukraine. There is no proof of wrongdoing on the tapes, and the Biden campaign maintains that these releases are blatant Russian meddling against the former vice president.

>Trump's willingness to capitalize on Russian meddling in the 2020 election is a similar tactic to the one that Trump's campaign embraced in 2016, as Trump advisers strategized around WikiLeaks disclosures that were facilitated by Russia, according to special counsel Robert Mueller.

> Four years ago, the first WikiLeaks releases arrived on the eve of the Democratic convention in July 2016, and Trump used the stolen emails to inflame divisions within the Democratic Party, tweeting, ""The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her."" Mueller's investigation later revealed that this intraparty tension was exactly what the Russians were hoping to stoke.

> While the GRU and WikiLeaks were releasing hacked documents, the Trump Campaign sought to maximize the impact of those leaks to aid Trump's electoral prospects. Staff on the Trump Campaign sought advance notice about WikiLeaks releases, created messaging strategies to promote and share the materials in anticipation of and following thdr release, and encouraged further leaks. The Trump Campaign publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia and was indifferent to whether it and WikiLeaks were furthering a Russian election interference effort. The Committee found no evidence that Campaign officials received an authoritative government notification that the hack was perpetrated by the Russian government before October 7, 2016, when the ODNI and DHS issued a joint statement to that effect. However, the Campaign was aware of the extensive media reporting and other private sector attribution of the hack to Russian actors prior to that point.",700594b109fc2ef9bffc0a4ee2cbebe7,confirm_ham,ics0fc,5f3e57b3f32e7900092c0fbe

The point of contention is:

>> Are you saying that these Republican officials are only denouncing Trump because they feel that having a Democrat such as Biden elected would better serve their pro-war interests? Even though it would be against most of their other interests since Republicans and Democrats tend to be pretty divided on numerous issues? And also view each other quite negatively? That seems kind of unlikely to me with these things in mind. 

Basically, what matters is whether not this group is (or is not) more likely to be pro-war in action.  I think this matters big time, whereas you had written a convincing opposing idea.  To me, this is a potential risk increase so I disagree, and explain why.

> And *it is indeed not necessarily false* which is why I said that it's ""unlikely"" rather than saying a word like, ""definitely"". 

I'm writing more so with respect to third party readers.  I don't believe I can change your mind to be more risk wary, but perhaps I can add a different perspective to how others consider the world.  So, I tried to make this option more visible.  (It's also objectively true, just so we're clear.)

> But also, pointing out that we don't know with absolute certainty why these officials are attempting to denounce Trump isn't really useful towards conversation about it either

Oh?  Is there a list somewhere of what points are and are not allowed?  To me this involves the military, therefore risk to people's lives, therefore it should be discussed.  I unironically think that military affairs are serious business.

If one takes the simplistic view that an accurate measurement of ""military operations"" consists of simply counting troop deployments.  That's certainly not the level of detail military strategists think in.

Now here's an interesting situation:  are you aware of the various layers of complexity involved in military operations, but chose to overlook it?  Were you unaware?

One an organization has demonstrated (based on body count) that their word (and the media who covers their tracks) cannot be trusted, it takes time to earn it back.  For me, the US Military body count is high enough in my lifetime that I will never full trust them again.   But trust isn't a binary, so I wouldn't oppose all military options necessarily, but I lean very heavily against war.

Of course.  It was a risky tactic, but I think it was worth a try.  I'd rather we *try* to do something with North Korea rather than let it continue to fester.  There's risk whatever you do.

Depends whether you know that the numbers that are revealed and the narratives told by the experts are only a sliver of the actual underlying story.  You can take whatever story you're told at face value (babies being stolen from incubators, for example), I'm going to *also* pay attention to whether the narrative makes sense, what obviously relevant parts are being left out, who has what to gain, what are the potential ""unintended"" (and unmentioned) consequences etc.

approvecomment,"From the summary of the law:

> (13) The Equal Access to Public Property Act of 2012 makes it a Class A misdemeanor for a person to camp on state property that is not specifically designated as a camping area. Present law provides various examples of what constitutes camping. This bill specifies that camping occurs between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., and revises and expands the examples of what constitutes camping. This bill adds that, in order to commit an offense, a person must have received an official warning not to engage in camping on state property and either continued to camp on state property or returned within 24 hours of the warning to continue to engage in camping. Under present law, items used to illegally camp on state property are subject to seizure and forfeiture. This bill instead establishes a process by which any items used to illegally camp on state property may be taken into state custody and disposed of; provided, notice of the seizing agency's contact information is posted near the scene of the seizure, the property is held for 90 days during which time the owner may reclaim the property after payment of a reasonable storage fee, and the property is not needed for evidence in a criminal proceeding. This bill provides immunity from liability to state government agencies and their agents who are involved in seizing property that is used to illegally camp on state property. This bill increases the punishment for illegal camping on state property from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class E felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 days imprisonment and an order of restitution for any property damage or loss incurred as a result of the offense;

So illegal camping - as defined by a 2012 law - is still illegal; but it's now more illegal.

You still get a warning, though, and you have to ignore that before you face charges; and there's still no penalty for peacefully protesting during the day.

The shooter was being attacked. The first man shot threw a molotov at him and attacked him.  After defending himself from the first attacker he was rushed by the mob. He was struck in the head  and fell. 

>It is not neutral to omit that the violence was from a militia member firing on unarmed protesters.

Of course Fauci, the member of the task force that is the most â€œoutspoken criticâ€� of Trumps handling of the pandemic, was the one who was absent for these deliberations (also, Iâ€™m being generous when I say heâ€™s an â€œoutspoken criticâ€�. Heâ€™s clearly maintained a very high degree of professionalism and has chosen to approach things as a â€œlet me clarify what Trump is saying hereâ€� manner. Heâ€™s basically the voice of respectful dissent). 

With that said, I want to say that the Trump administration has brought the presidency down to an uncomfortably relatable level. 

For context: I work at a startup company that grew way too quickly for its own good, so very few people in leadership roles actually had leadership skillsâ€”they were just good at the job they held before and were promoted without further training. When I got my first leadership role at this company (and I actually have a lot of experience in management before this company, just not in the industry Iâ€™m working in), decisions were frequently made when those who were most willing to dissent from the majority were absent. I noticed this trend continue as I worked my way up and eventually became one of those dissenting voices, and the only thing that ended this trend was a new CEO who actually recognized the problem with management and brought over new dept managers from our sister company to help fix things. 

Anyway, itâ€™s just insane to me that the state department seems to be handling a pandemic that has killed millions and destroyed our economy in basically the same way that the start up digital marketing company I work for handles somewhat consequential management decisions.",03bfabfcc8b989cee48257c071b21640,confirm_ham,ih9mqu,5f47ba0bf32e7900092c758c

approvecomment,"Bit more nuanced and detailed than that.

A different study, focussing only on Arizona looked at those who tested positive for the antibodies:

> To determine the infection fatality rate in Arizona, we divided the percentage of the stateâ€™s population who had died from Covid-19 as of July 30, 2020, by the 12.9% of the population that was infected based on antibody testing between July 20 and July 26, 2020. Antibody testing captures the total percentage of the population that had been infected with Covid-19 from the beginning of the outbreak. We then calculated and applied a standard correction factor for the delay between case diagnosis and death. This yielded an infection fatality rate of 0.63%, which is not significantly different from the CDCâ€™s best estimate of 0.65% for the U.S. in the Spring of 2020.

[This is congruent with previous estimates.](https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/24/infection-fatality-rate-shows-covid-19-isnt-getting-less-deadly/)

> The most likely explanation is that the large increase in testing since the spring has increased the number of diagnosed cases several fold. The reported fatality rate is calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of diagnosed cases. A larger number of diagnosed cases due to more testing would decrease the reported fatality rate. This conclusion is consistent with a CDC report that the true number of infections was underestimated in the U.S. during the March-to-May period by as much as 10 fold.

As per the source interview, to get the lower number 0.1-0.4% they went through a more rigorous examination of the data and eliminated deaths that clearly were not due to the coronavirus, just because they died with it, for example [motor vehicle accidents](https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/governor-questions-traffic-fatality-classified-covid-19-death/) and controlled for how some cases get [double-counted if a person gets tested multiple times](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/virginia-begin-double-counting-positive-coronavirus-cases) and other details",73d03c2bf48d94c118a0ba7d4700e105,confirm_ham,ihf2wt,5f47f4a3f32e7900092c7874

I've seen a video of a guy commiting a robbery jump off a motorcycle with a gun, start shooting at his victims only to be shot himself and instantly paralyzed from the waist down. The robber/shooter doesn't stop shooting at all. He falls to the ground and continues firing his weapon until he is out of ammunition. It's a perfect example of why you should NEVER shoot to wound but until the threat is eliminated and the only sure fire way to know the threat is eliminated it to not stop shooting until they stop all movement.

I'm looking for the video now, but not having much luck.

As someone who carries concealed, the same applies to my defensive use of a firearm as well. 

I can't draw my firearm and hold someone at gun point. That's potentially brandishing. I can't shoot to wound. That's potentially attempted homicide and could also mean that it was premeditated... If I had time to aim for a leg, I could have had time to turn and run.

Aren't most large cities in America predominantly Democratic-leaning, thus they'd be subject to Democratic leadership? I would absolutely be interested to see how Republican-led major cities have responded to these incidents and how their responses have contrasted with Democratic-led cities.

> Dems have certainly been strangely silenton the matter of violent protests.

Agreed, and that's been a very large problem throughout this whole thing. Almost nobody on the Democratic side has even come close to criticizing the violent protesters, like we have here in Portland, who are nothing more than opportunistic assholes looking for violence.

removecomment,"There are unfortunately far too many instances where somebody is killed when they don't represent a threat, but this specific instance wasn't nearly as black and white as the murder of George Floyd or Breonna Taylor. This is my understanding of what happened:

The police responding were told by a 9-1-1 dispatcher that Jacob Blake had taken the caller's keys, and was on her property without her permission. Police were also informed on the way that he had an outstanding warrant for third-degree sexual assault (this does not mean he raped a minor as some right wing pundits are saying) meaning he had to be taken into custody. Upon arriving and informing him that they needed to take him into custody, a fight broke out with Blake and officers struggling on the ground. Police deployed a taser in an attempt to non-lethally pacify him, but it didn't work. Blake then walked to his car with weapons trained on him, then appeared to reach either between the seats or for the glovebox.

 * [S 29.593](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/29/VIII/593) is the law pertaining requiring a permit to hunt.

[The police responding were told by a 9-1-1 dispatcher that Jacob Blake had taken the caller's keys, and was on her property without her permission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS0XolHcw14&t=320s).

Upon arriving and informing him that they needed to take him into custody, a fight broke out with Blake and officers struggling on the ground. Police deployed a taser in an attempt to non-lethally pacify him, but it didn't work. Blake then walked to his car with weapons trained on him, then appeared to reach either between the seats or for the glovebox. At this point, I believe police were reasonable in assuming he was reaching for a weapon and were justified in using lethal force.

As an example, imagine a family of 4, including two children away at college.  Dad is politically interested, wife is moderately, and college kids (as is the norm) aren't interested in voting yet.  Suddenly, the father can vote for at least himself and the two kids and possibly the wife as well.  That triples or quadruples his voting power.

approvecomment,"Signature verification does less to secure ballots than it does to cause real ballots with non matching signatures to get rejected. Many people have signatures which have evolved or changed over time. When people's signatures change, their votes are getting rejected and often they were not being informed - in one case the ACLU won a court case for a person whose vote was rejected and they were entirely unaware it had been until the ACLU contacted them.

The people who are matching the signatures are not experts at handwriting analysis. I looked hard for studies on whether signature verification is actually reliable and couldn't find much.


The HEROES act suggested replacing some forms of identification with a sworn signed statement. I'm not sure quite how that matches up with your claim that it removes signature analysis. If anything it seems to do the opposite. Can you quote where your source supports your claim?

Similarly your second source says the lawsuit (not by Democrats) seeks to give votes a chance to correct their if they are rejected based on signatures. Does that seem reasonable?

In my view you're sources don't support your claims. Rather they say something quite different. This is becoming a pattern.

Where do you get that idea? The man & the people around him [regularly and frequently lie](https://bit.ly/2QFGv0r) and mislead the public.

>how many are republican?

How is that relevant to Joe Biden's leadership? He's not President. He's not the one who's been saying he'll quell the riots by force. Beside that, the fact that these events are transpiring nationwide means the reason for the events must transcend localities. I can't imagine a justification for holding local officials accountable for nationwide events.

You still haven't answered my original questions. How are examples of (other) news outlets misleading their audience at all relevant to the RNC using footage from last year in Spain with the implication that it's America, now? Are you implying that the footage is actually from America, now, & that NBC is lying about the video? If so, you really need to find some supporting evidence for that claim, namely, you'll need to find the source for the RNC footage & somehow show that it's from America.

Regardless, how would any of that be Biden's fault as future President if the ongoing riots are not Trump's fault as current President? Biden holds no blame for a current issue when he doesn't even have the job, yet. Either the riots right now are Trump's fault, or if the riots continue under Biden, they're not his fault. It can't go both ways. It's the same job; either the President is responsible for riots under his watch, or he's not.",e36e72a1ef1011d7b6d81f53c829a279,URL shortener or image hosting site,ijnwn0,5f4d57f0f32e7900092cace8

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session

The aim of a struggle session was to shape public opinion and humiliate, persecute, or execute political rivals and those deemed class enemies.[1]

In general, the victim of a struggle session was forced to admit various crimes before a crowd of people who would verbally and physically abuse the victim until he or she confessed. Struggle sessions were often held at the workplace of the accused, but they were sometimes conducted in sports stadiums where large crowds would gather if the target was well-known

Struggle campaigns emerged as a tactic to secure the allegiance of the Chinese people 


https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8664345/Aggressive-crowd-BLM-protesters-accost-white-diners-outside-DC-restaurants.html

A large crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters have accosted white diners outside several Washington, D.C. restaurants, demanding that they raise their fists to show solidarity with the movement. 

Footage showing the demonstrators aggressively yelling at one woman in the Adams Morgan neighborhood went viral on social media and sparked a widespread backlash.  

Many accused the protesters of acting like an 'aggressive mob' and using 'intimidation tactics' to order diners into submission.  Responding to the footage, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough described the activists as 'horrible people'.

In my response to you in another post, you use the 94% underlying illnesses as the reason why Corona is nothing to worry about, yet when I show you the same statistic from the CDC and how it affects 200 million in the US, you mention that diseases aren't illnesses. According to your initial source (which you say is the CDC) they are referring to diseases which you are calling illnesses. I don't assume the wordplay is intentional, but the same data doesn't mean anything different if you change illness with disease. The impact is that the majority of the US has to worry about COVID-19 because the majority of the US has an underlying health condition. 



Here's a great [countersource](https://www.axios.com/cdc-covid-deaths-contributing-health-conditions-3315196c-986f-4ae3-ba35-2075fd64bce1.html) to your initial claim as to why contributing health conditions should be factored in.

approvecomment,"You can say whatever you want about Trump and whether or not he has defended White Nationalists or violence from the right or not, but the fact remains that this man does everything he can to divide this country as much as possible instead of unite us whenever an opportunity presents itself - that is a fact and it is supported by history and the facts.

[General James Mattis said it best](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869262728/read-the-full-statement-from-jim-mattis)

> Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people â€” does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.

There have been so many opportunities for Trump to put his ego aside, put politics and partisanship aside and try to unite this country, but at each opportunity, he has chosen to further inflame tensions and create more divide and anger between Americans. For example, just last night, [a reporter asked if he'd condemn the murder of 2 people in Kenosha, and Trump wouldn't, and then *defended* the murderer](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/31/908137377/trump-defends-kenosha-shooting-suspect). We all know of the infamous [""very fine people"" press conference](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/15/543769884/transcript-trump-shifts-tone-again-on-white-nationalist-rally-in-charlottesville), where Trump couldn't even bring himself to coherently condemn Neo-Nazis because he *had* to say there was also ""very fine people"" within that group, and that ""the other side"" was to blame as well. I mean, after a woman was ran over by a Neo-Nazi, the guy said there was violence ""on many sides"".

Not only that, but 2 more examples, per the article OP posted:

> The president similarly defended members of a Trump-backing caravan of trucks and cars that took on protesters Saturday night in Portland, firing paintballs and other projectiles at them as they roared past. â€œPaint is a defensive mechanism,â€� Trump said. â€œPaint is not bullets.â€� 

> The president also seemed to express sympathy with police officers who kill unarmed civilians, many of them Black, in the line of duty, saying they have just a split second to make a decision and sometimes â€œchoke.â€�

The President isn't supposed to be the President only for the people who support him, but that's where we are. So when Biden says Trump is a ""toxic presence"", just think about",ee00b21adaa3148db7cd23de6e13d5c8,confirm_ham,ikbrh9,5f4e8198f32e7900092cb735

You're engaging in utter sophistry.

1. u/EatATaco claimed we can know Fauci's intent because he states it in the original article. ""(H)is intent is known. He just made it known. It's in the article.""

2. You claimed his intent was declared, but that we cannot know whether or not he was lying and that individuals might not even know their own intent. ""A casual review of history will reveal that politicians are not always truthful. Furthermore, psychology, neurology, and philosophy cast doubt on the idea that it is even possible for an individual to truly know the full ""intent"" behind their own actions.""

3. EatATaco asked you to provide proof of this. ""Okay, sure, he could be lying. Do you have any evidence of this or are you just blindly speculating?""

4. You insinuated (though did not overtly claim) that EatATaco is the one making an assertion. ""Which one of us is making an assertion, and which one of us is challenging an assertion? In such situations, with which party does the burden of proof lie (in general, and according to this subreddit's guidelines)?""

This is our context. We're no longer talking about linguistics and propaganda, not at the moment. We're talking about your claim that Fauci is lying and your claim that the burden of proof lies on someone else to challenge you. For some reason you argue the status quo is your assertion that the person we're discussing acted in bad faith, and not that the person we're discussing acted in good faith, to which you could offer a negative argument if you felt like it.

Of course the status quo and objective reality aren't synonymous. I don't see that as having anything to do with the discussion at hand.

I disagree.  Can you point to any discrete statements I've made that are objectively untrue?  To me, this seems a bit like the pot calling the kettle black.

> u/EatATaco claimed we can know Fauci's intent because he states it in the original article. ""(H)is intent is known. He just made it known. It's in the article.""

I think a conclusive claim requires supernatural abilities.  

If you'd like to up the stakes, I could introduce into evidence the interesting details of Fauci's confessed intent when advising the public to not wear masks at the outset of the pandemic.

> You claimed his intent was declared, but that we cannot know whether or not he was lying and that individuals might not even know their own intent.

If you believe this is not true, I welcome you to post evidence proving it so.

> EatATaco asked you to provide proof of this.

I believe such a proof requires supernatural abilities which I do not have.  

> You insinuated (though did not overtly claim) that EatATaco is the one making an assertion.

If he would like to explicitly note that he was speculating, I think it would improve the quality of discourse and more closely align opinions.

> We're no longer talking about linguistics and propaganda, not at the moment.

What we are talking about is complex.  I am introducing strict epistemic standards into the discussion, which seems to be unpopular lately.

> We're talking about your claim that Fauci is lying

I don't think I made any such claim.

> and your claim that the burden of proof lies on someone else to challenge you.

I don't think I made any such claim.  The burden of proof is on the person *actually* making an assertion.

> For some reason you argue the status quo is your assertion 

Not true - please refer to the recorded transcript of the conversation and quote my words if you believe I am mistaken.

> Of course the status quo and objective reality aren't synonymous. I don't see that as having anything to do with the discussion at hand. 

I was under the impression that the two were conflated.

Beyond that, the number of COVID cases is surely higher than the positive tests show, a review from influenza-like symptoms being diagnosed in March shows that as many as 80% of the cases of **symptomatic** COVID may have gone untested and undiagnosed.^[2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-millions-cases-u-s-may-have-gone-undiagnosed-march)

Biden has said many things.  Your individual perception may be one of clarity, mine is otherwise, and objective reality is something else entirely.

> He has said he condemns all violence from both sides and has not put out any statements that contradict that. 

I've said lots of things in the past that I know are not true, and I doubt I'm the only one.  Can we find any examples in the past where a politician knowingly said something that was not true?  Could it happen again?  Might something similar happening here?  The answer to such questions are often not known.

I am not opposed to speculation, provided it is explicit.  As the sidebar says:  ""Source your facts. If you're claiming something to be true, you need to back it up by linking to a qualified and relevant source There is no ""common knowledge"" exception, and anecdotal evidence is not allowed.""  I would add ""*Clearly* distinguish between opinion and fact (and be mindful of the ever present difference)"" to that, but I suspect I have higher epistemic standards than the average political junkie.",17a8c0f6945e933c4881b4b3b716e77f,remove,ikbrh9,5f4ed97bf32e7900092cbba7

approvecomment,"You can say whatever you want about Trump and whether or not he has defended White Nationalists or violence from the right or not, but the fact remains that this man does everything he can to divide this country as much as possible instead of unite us whenever an opportunity presents itself - that is a fact and it is supported by history and the facts.

[General James Mattis said it best](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/04/869262728/read-the-full-statement-from-jim-mattis)

> Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people â€” does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.

There have been so many opportunities for Trump to put his ego aside, put politics and partisanship aside and try to unite this country, but at each opportunity, he has chosen to further inflame tensions and create more divide and anger between Americans. For example, just last night, [a reporter asked if he'd condemn the murder of 2 people in Kenosha, and Trump wouldn't, and then *defended* the murderer](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/31/908137377/trump-defends-kenosha-shooting-suspect). We all know of the infamous [""very fine people"" press conference](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/15/543769884/transcript-trump-shifts-tone-again-on-white-nationalist-rally-in-charlottesville), where Trump couldn't even bring himself to coherently condemn Neo-Nazis because he *had* to say there was also ""very fine people"" within that group, and that ""the other side"" was to blame as well. I mean, after a woman was ran over by a Neo-Nazi, the guy said there was violence ""on many sides"".

Not only that, but 2 more examples, per the article OP posted:

> The president similarly defended members of a Trump-backing caravan of trucks and cars that took on protesters Saturday night in Portland, firing paintballs and other projectiles at them as they roared past. â€œPaint is a defensive mechanism,â€� Trump said. â€œPaint is not bullets.â€� 

> The president also seemed to express sympathy with police officers who kill unarmed civilians, many of them Black, in the line of duty, saying they have just a split second to make a decision and sometimes â€œchoke.â€�

The President isn't supposed to be the President only for the people who support him, but that's where we are. So when Biden says Trump is a ""toxic presence"", just think about",ee00b21adaa3148db7cd23de6e13d5c8,confirm_ham,ikbrh9,5f4ed97bf32e7900092cbbaa

The first part that you bolded about him being wrongfully prosecuted has absolutely nothing to do with why I posted the decision.  I didn't think that *his* speech was the same as Trumps, I was pointing out that the decision put a tighter definition on imminent in that it requires a ""definite time"" in which the lawless action is to be committed.  The rest of what you bolded *literally proves me right*.  Trump isn't advocating that people commit an act of lawlessness *at some point in time*, he's advocating that they commit an act of lawlessness (in two parts) between now and November 3rd 2020 and then *very definitely* on November 3rd, 2020.  That isn't ""some indefinite time in the future"" that is a *very definite window of time with a specific beginning and specific end*.

Also, in response to something you said below about it being arguable that he is inciting lawless action please use *Trump's quotes, not people from his campaign:*

>**So let them send it in and let them go vote**, and if their system's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote. **If it isn't tabulated, they'll be able to vote**

>If it's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote. If it isn't tabulated, they'll be able to vote. So that's the way it is. **And that's what they should do.**

>

>**...and if they haven't counted it you can vote.**

[In many states a mail-in ballot doesn't have to be received until sometime in the afternoon or evening of Election Day or, in some outlier cases, several days after Election Day.](https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/)  Also, in at least some states like California, [you can bring your mail-in vote into a polling place and if you had requested a mail in ballot but didn't bring it with you to a polling place you get a provisional ballot which will only be counted once they confirm you didn't mail in your mail-in ballot.](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/voting-california/if-you-applied/)  

So to *intentionally* go into a polling place after mailing in a ballot that may or may not have been received and processed by the state yet to *double cast your vote as* ***instructed by the president*** would be election fraud and Trump instructing the American people to do so is inciting lawless action.

approvecomment,"The bolded lines in that source prove my point.  The first part

>In a per curiam decision, the **Court overturned Hessâ€™s conviction**, ruling that he had been w**rongly prosecuted because his speech was protected**.

is irrelevant to my argument.  I didn't think that *his* speech was the same as Trumps, I was pointing out that the decision put a tighter definition on ""imminent"" in that it requires a ""definite time"" in which the lawless action is to be committed; Hess' conviction was overturned, as stated in the decision, because his speech advocated for lawlessness in some *indefinite* future.  It's that bit, that it was overturned because of its *indefinite* timeline that *proves my point*.  Trump isn't advocating that people commit an act of lawlessness *at some point in time*, he's advocating that they commit an act of lawlessness (in two parts) between now and November 3rd 2020 and then *very definitely* on November 3rd, 2020.  That isn't ""some indefinite time in the future"" that is a *very definite window of time with a specific beginning and specific end*.

In response to usage of his campaign official's quotes I request that everyone read *Trump's own quotes*, not ones from people in his campaign:

>**So let them send it in and let them go vote**, and if their system's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote. **If it isn't tabulated, they'll be able to vote**  
>  
>If it's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote. If it isn't tabulated, they'll be able to vote. So that's the way it is. **And that's what they should do.**  
>  
>**...and if they haven't counted it you can vote.**

[In many states a mail-in ballot doesn't have to be received until sometime in the afternoon or evening of Election Day or, in some outlier cases, several days after Election Day.](https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/)  Also, in at least some states like California, [you can bring your mail-in vote into a polling place and if you had requested a mail in ballot but didn't bring it with you to a polling place you get a provisional ballot which will only be counted once they confirm you didn't mail in your mail-in ballot.](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/voting-california/if-you-applied/)

So to *intentionally* go into a polling place after mailing in a ballot that may or may not have been received and processed by the state yet to *double cast your vote as* ***instructed by the president*** would be election fraud and Trump instructing the American people to do so is inciting lawless action.

2. Trivialization/Mischaracterization:  The most recent example I can think of was during the beginning to middle part of the lock down.  [Some small business owners were really hurting](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/06/11/small-businesses-struggle-with-the-pandemic-and-protests/) and [having a difficult times making ends mee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/small-firms-die-quietly-leaving-thousands-of-failures-uncounted)t and began a protest.

3. Hypocrisy:  Want to gather in large groups at a rally or to protest the lock downs?  You're [spreading the virus](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/lockdown-protests-spread-coronavirus-cellphone-data).

So much for testing and tracing , I guess.  Maybe the virus evaluates the righteousness of the underlying cause of the rally and chooses not to infect the righteous.

For instance, your 4.25 GPA is relative to your school whereas the valedictorian with the 3.98 from another school may or may not actually be â€œbetterâ€� than you because of the differing qualities in schools and grade inflation (or lack thereof). 

An SAT score would help highlight the differences in education levels and hint at which schools are inflating grades. Theoretically, in a perfectly balanced world, people with the same GPA would score similarly on the SAT because their GPAâ€™s and SAT scores would be correlated. Taking the assumption that the world isnâ€™t balanced, SAT scores or similar tests would be the only way to make it an apples to apples normalization of the studentsâ€™ performance.

Despite some claims about excited delirium not being a recognized medical diagnosis, it remains a well documented phenomenon and is directly associated with rhabdomylosis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, both of which are fatal conditions [2]. We can make academic arguments about what does and does not constitute excited delirium all day long, however, the fact remains that the ingestion of psychoactive substances can lead to a state of aggression, agitation, paranoia, violence, and unexplained physical strength [2]. People suffering from this condition often cannot be reasoned with and are extremely aggressive toward any attempted intervention [3]. As easy as it may be to leave these individuals to their own devices, they more often than not present a danger to themselves and the people around them and will do irreparable harm if not appropriately intervened. 

Itâ€™s also worth noting that excited delirium is not a â€œmental health crisisâ€� and labeling it as such does a disservice to to anyone who actually suffers from a mental health disorder. It is a self-induced psychosis that comes as a risk of abusing psychoactive substances.

It's interesting that they chose this metric. The US not only has done the most number of total tests but the most tests per capita population. They've objectively tested more than any other country. ""Tests per confirmed case"" only shows that other countries have less confirmed cases per capita than we do and have tested more healthy people while the US appears to be testing more unhealthy people or people with symptoms.  All this metric does is prove that we have a lot more confirmed cases than other countries which has nothing to do with the total amount of testing done or per capita testing done. 
  
 This was an accurate statement from Trump and is a good example of how bias makes its way into fact checks that appear unbiased on the surface.

Yes, which costs money. Money they donâ€™t have. Because, again, maybe let me repeat this in case you missed it, but 97% of their budget is salaries and benefits. If you think police officers are rolling in excess dough, youâ€™re more delusional and out of touch than any conservative Iâ€™ve ever met. 

You know why there are so many shitty cops? Because anyone who walks through the door wanting to become a cop who can get through their (simple, insufficient) training can become a cop. Itâ€™s not a competitive role where they have the luxury of filtering out everyone with a big ego or a hot head or a power complex. You know why itâ€™s not a competitive role? Because it pays like shit. 

So if you want better cops, you need 1) competitive salaries and 2) comprehensive training. Both of these things cost money. Remind me again where weâ€™re going to get this money, when all the current budget goes to paying their currently inadequate salaries and benefits?",5170af5d0623878bd663cbf93bf85664,remove,im36cp,5f5236d0f32e7900092cdbc0

Can you point to a few examples of municipalities, states, or the federal government responding more to extreme slogans like ""defund police"" or ""abolish police"" versus the more grounded arguments for police reform people have been making for decades? One of the most glaring failures of the recent BLM protests has been a lack of real change produced by local officials. I can't think of a single place that has implemented real police reform in response to the George Floyd protests. The only thing you get are politicians making empty promises. So, on that front I fail to see the difference between moderate and extreme messaging when the outcome is effectively identical.

What would make you say that?

Hereâ€™s just one except:

>â€œThe corresponding instrumental variables estimates imply that an additional officer per 10,000 residents reduces victimization costs by about $35 per capita, with an implied crime-police elasticity of -1.17.

removecomment,"Thatâ€™s actually how provisional voting works in a few states, including mine of Ca.

Every citizen is entitled to know whether or not their vote was tabulated by some free means. And you are allowed to request a mail in ballot and show up at the polls and request a provisional ballot if your vote has not yet been counted.

The way it is supposed to work is they donâ€™t count the provisional vote until they know whether or not your mail in vote was received. If it has they donâ€™t count the provisional vote. If it hasnâ€™t they do.

The purpose of provisional ballots is for if you didnâ€™t send in your mail in ballot for some reason and the check is to hold it to the side to make sure it didnâ€™t get turned in.

It is unclear whether â€œsuspected mail tamperingâ€� qualifies as a valid justification for filling out a provisional ballot.

Regardless the system is supposed to ensure no voter can vote twice even if they try to.

If the system is flawed and both votes get counted, then Trump is 100% right about voter fraud being a huge issue.

If the system is not flawed in this way, you make more work for polls and no vote is double counted. But IMO, itâ€™s well worth doubling or multiplying by 10 the work of poll workers to prove the election is valid. The US government has a responsibility to fund the polls which means you should be paying for it indirectly anyways.

Of course, this only gets at the double voting kind of fraud. If anyone moved and did not change their registration, it is possible the new resident of their old location could receive a mail in ballot and turn it in illegally and this vote should be counted instead of the actual personâ€™s provisional vote. This is the so called â€œdead people votingâ€� issue. Which would mean residents of recently rented homes could have a disproportionately higher percentage of the vote by virtue of voting on behalf of people who no longer live there. And if the people who moved donâ€™t vote in the election, there is zero possibility of tracking down that kind of election fraud.

If youâ€™re dumb enough to not register your current location, you need to be smart enough to figure to check to see if your provisional vote was counted. If you donâ€™t, then there is /also/ no way to check for electoral fraud. And my guess is if you were dumb and lazy once, you wonâ€™t check that your vote was counted.

Thereâ€™s also the issue of people entering a multiple polling locations under different identities and voting for other people.

Ultimately, all kinds of voter fraud, except dead people voting, could be detected if EVERYONE voted. But since only a half of the US actually bother, that leaves a ton of room for widespread undetectable fraud.",7435a541bcc2a54d81b57e8d6967d8a3,remove,im8jmm,5f53018bf32e7900092ce364

Lets look at the atlantic.  The majority owner is also one of the largest donors to joe biden.  She is also in regular contact with the editor-in-chief.  The atlantic was caught recently publishing a story about a cop who shot a kid and received no legal punishment, but it turned out it was a security guard who shot an adult and went to jail.  Also the news organization just laid off 17% of their workers, definitely a cause to run any story that could help the bottom line.

approvecomment,"Thatâ€™s actually how provisional voting works in a few states, including mine of Ca.

Every citizen is entitled to know whether or not their vote was tabulated by some free means. And you are allowed to request a mail in ballot and show up at the polls and request a provisional ballot if your vote has not yet been counted.

The way it is supposed to work is they donâ€™t count the provisional vote until they know whether or not your mail in vote was received. If it has they donâ€™t count the provisional vote. If it hasnâ€™t they do.

The purpose of provisional ballots is for if you didnâ€™t send in your mail in ballot for some reason and the check is to hold it to the side to make sure it didnâ€™t get turned in.

It is unclear whether â€œsuspected mail tamperingâ€� qualifies as a valid justification for filling out a provisional ballot.

Regardless the system is supposed to ensure no voter can vote twice even if they try to.

If the system is flawed and both votes get counted, then Trump is 100% right about voter fraud being a huge issue.

If the system is not flawed in this way, you make more work for polls and no vote is double counted. But IMO, itâ€™s well worth doubling or multiplying by 10 the work of poll workers to prove the election is valid. The US government has a responsibility to fund the polls which means you should be paying for it indirectly anyways.

Of course, this only gets at the double voting kind of fraud. If anyone moved and did not change their registration, it is possible the new resident of their old location could receive a mail in ballot and turn it in illegally and this vote should be counted instead of the actual personâ€™s provisional vote. This is the so called â€œdead people votingâ€� issue. Which would mean residents of recently rented homes could have a disproportionately higher percentage of the vote by virtue of voting on behalf of people who no longer live there. And if the people who moved donâ€™t vote in the election, there is zero possibility of tracking down that kind of election fraud.

If youâ€™re dumb enough to not register your current location, you need to be smart enough to figure to check to see if your provisional vote was counted. If you donâ€™t, then there is /also/ no way to check for electoral fraud. And my guess is if you were dumb and lazy once, you wonâ€™t check that your vote was counted.

Thereâ€™s also the issue of people entering a multiple polling locations under different identities and voting for other people.

Ultimately, all kinds of voter fraud, except dead people voting, could be detected if EVERYONE voted. But since only a half of the US actually bother, that leaves a ton of room for widespread undetectable fraud.

>	limit the police that are allowed to make an arrest (they should be allowed to detain, but without force)

So then whatâ€™s a cop supposed to do when they pull over someone with a warrant out for their arrest for a violent crime? This situation happens every day. What about when they pull over someone who is transporting a human trafficking victim? Or a kidnapper with a child in the back seat screaming to you that the driver isnâ€™t their father?

>	If your average police officer can't arrest you, you have a lot less to lose by talking to them.

Doesnâ€™t mean you wonâ€™t kill them anyway. Plenty of these incidents have been over routine traffic stops:

>	only that they aren't issued firearms or given any special permission to use them

What kind of job isnâ€™t allowed to give you the necessary equipment to perform your duties? Thatâ€™s insanity. 

>	It's hard to be friendly to someone who is legally allowed to hurt you even if you're innocent

Then end qualified immunity. Thatâ€™s a good argument. Everything else you said isnâ€™t. 

The real world isnâ€™t as clean or simple as you seem to want to make it.

In our current environment, the cop would immediately have you exit the vehicle, put your hands on your head, and cuff you. Theyâ€™d have their hand poised by their gun in case you tried anything. If a cop canâ€™t do any of those things, youâ€™re going to see a lot more dead cops and a lot more criminals getting away.

Let's not waste time arguing about whether the protests are violent, but why so many people are upset enough to consider violence.

>Wasowâ€™s study fits into a broader consensus that nonviolent protests tend to yield outcomes that achieve a movementâ€™s goals better than violent protests do. But there is some research that pushes back on this. For instance, another recent study by political scientists Ryan Enos, Aaron Kaufman and Melissa Sands found that the 1992 Los Angeles uprising â€” a violent reaction to the acquittal of four police officers caught on camera beating Rodney King, a black man â€” didnâ€™t spark a backlash. Instead, they found that the protests may have led to an increase in support for funding local public schools. Similarly, the Black Lives Matter protests following the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers seemed to have led to decreased racial resentment among white Americans â€” especially among younger people â€” even though there was violence associated with some of the protests.

[links in the article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-protests-can-do/)

>One important thing to remember here is that **minority-led protests historically tend to draw more of a police presence than predominantly white protests, and the police are often more likely to use force against minority-led protests.** So in many instances, the violence we may associate with these protests isnâ€™t because these protests are inherently more violent; itâ€™s because they draw more intense police contact to begin with. So if the research from the 1992 uprising and recent Black Lives Matter protests is any indication, itâ€™s possible that violence in some protests may not entirely upend a movementâ€™s goals.",e947431f2bb5a45fb0345a0ca99a9b09,URL shortener or image hosting site,ink4j7,5f5508aff32e7900092cf417

>Wasowâ€™s study fits into a broader consensus that nonviolent protests tend to yield outcomes that achieve a movementâ€™s goals better than violent protests do. But there is some research that pushes back on this. For instance, another recent study by political scientists Ryan Enos, Aaron Kaufman and Melissa Sands found that the 1992 Los Angeles uprising â€” a violent reaction to the acquittal of four police officers caught on camera beating Rodney King, a black man â€” didnâ€™t spark a backlash. Instead, they found that the protests may have led to an increase in support for funding local public schools. Similarly, the Black Lives Matter protests following the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers seemed to have led to decreased racial resentment among white Americans â€” especially among younger people â€” even though there was violence associated with some of the protests.

>One important thing to remember here is that **minority-led protests historically tend to draw more of a police presence than predominantly white protests, and the police are often more likely to use force against minority-led protests.** So in many instances, the violence we may associate with these protests isnâ€™t because these protests are inherently more violent; itâ€™s because they draw more intense police contact to begin with. So if the research from the 1992 uprising and recent Black Lives Matter protests is any indication, itâ€™s possible that violence in some protests may not entirely upend a movementâ€™s goals.",e947431f2bb5a45fb0345a0ca99a9b09,unspam,ink4j7,5f5509dbf32e7900092cf427

removecomment,">Even if this is true, a 7% rate of violence is really high. If 7% of Trump rallies ended up with looting and arson I guarantee they would not get the ""overwhelmingly peaceful"" label

I don't see how the two are comparable, to be honest. Rallies are not protests.

The closest Trump's supporters have come to protesting in large groups were the ""Liberate Michigan"" style protests where a bunch of cars honked their way into cities' downtowns, and a some armed folks walked inside the capital buildings while open-carrying. They lasted for a day, then the ""protests"" stopped.

In that way, sure, I think the Conservative-driven protests have been more peaceful. They're also incredibly short and ineffective. If the Conservatives who had occupied state capital buildings  and jammed roads had tried to do so for 100 days and nights, then they may have turned less peaceful.",59085f288aa03462be32b3892a0328db,remove,ink4j7,5f550b07f32e7900092cf436

removecomment,"I'm not saying that.

""For all we know"" is an expression which means ""we don't know whether or not"".

We don't know whether or not police responses to protests are causing violence because the article doesn't assign blaim. It only measures the rates at which protests become violent, not why.

And that is not the ""null hypothesis"". That's your default position. The null hypothesis is a scientific term meaning the hypothesis that the thing being tested has no effect.

> the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between specified populations, any observed difference being due to sampling or experimental error.

You are saying that your *starting position* is that it's not the fault of the police, and you want evidence to be convinced otherwise. Which is fine, but your starting bias is not the same as other people's bias, and therefore the only thing which happens if nobody provides evidence to change your mind is that your view remains the same. It doesn't change the basis of the converation for other people, and your position doesn't win by default.

Regardless, my point is just to recognise the article describes the rate of violence, not the cause. Hence why you can walk away with whatever bias you want because no evidence is provided. Other than the minimal statements that *some* violence is cause by police and *some* by protestors and *some* by outside actors.",38e2216dc3dc2cb196cbf4bab0d83541,remove,ink4j7,5f551211f32e7900092cf486

Ok, fine, I will try, even though I am very skeptical that this would help.

Conservatives, by definition, want to stop things from changing. Progressives, also by definition, want to change things. The effectiveness of either cannot be â€œmeasuredâ€� by giving random examples when one succeeded and the other failed (I would add, done in a complete unsystematic and probably really biased way; for example, AWB in VA did NOT happen, likely because of the 2a process, but you are not mentioning that). The effectiveness of conservative protests is the ratio of the number of things that did not change to the number of things that people pushed to change. The effectiveness of progressive protests is similarly a ratio of the number of things that changed to the number of things that people pushed to change. Whether one is more effective than the other would depend on which ratio is bigger.",8d2c305d10ea2550ed010a62fc2c82e0,remove,ink4j7,5f551467f32e7900092cf4aa

removecomment,"Despite the fact that I disagree with most of Navalny's politics, I wish him a speedy recovery and wouldn't want anyone to suffer such a fate. My prayers go out to his family.

The main question is qui prodest, who benefits? If a person was poisoned and he is a public figure, then someone needs it. 

According to the widely accepted premise, they acted to assassinate him in a very public and scandalous way, with a nerve agent that would so obviously tie the murder to Russia. Then, instead of finishing what they started during the 40 hours he was in Omsk, they arrange for him to be sent to Germany, despite the borders still being closed.

Why is it that in a country where the government, according to the West, control everything in a totalitarian way, could not, I apologize for the cynicism, finish the job? If this was an operation by the Russian special services, then why did the plane land in Omsk so that the doctors there could treat him? Why did the authorities extradite him to the West, despite all the quarantine measures? It was possible to use them as an excuse to leave Navalny in the country. But the West completely ignores everything that nullifies their version.

Once again, why would they sent him to Germany? So that Germany could find the Novichok and then  Russia gets punished for it? To sabotage the Nord Stream 2 project that will be crucial to the Russian economy? During an economically and politically unstable time where the popularity of the government is at record lows?

For what? To take out an opposition leader that doesn't pose a threat to Putin's power whatsoever? Once again, in a way that would obviously tie the murder to Russia and draw the attention of the West?

 If the content he released on his channel bothered them so much, Roskomnadzor would have closed it years ago.

How does Putin benefit from any of this?

This narrative was made for the Western consumer, to justify new sanctions and a halt to Nord Stream 2.

Also it's a very good way to further destabilize the political situation in Russia during a time that is already unstable.


Say what you want about our government, and believe me, there are many bad things to say about it, but I don't think that they are such near-sighted idiots.


The government is already quite unpopular because of its handling of the economy. The Ruble is weak, and the unpopular pension reform is still fresh in people's minds. The President is not as popular as he once was.

Now would be a perfect time to impose tough sanctions on Russia. The events in Belarus, the situation with the COVID vaccine, the Nord Stream pipeline. It will especially be damaging now with the unstable economy as a result of the COVID crisis, weak ruble and low oil prices. 

Navalny, even with his growing support, does not pose a real threat to Putin's power. He will occassionally release a video about some politician's multi-million euro apartment in London, but that's about it. 

For Putin, this situation has way more downsides than benefits. The opposition will have a martyr to rally around, and the West will go all out on sanctions. The economy will take quite a beating, seeing that it is already weak, which will make the government even more unpopular.

All the consequences I mentioned do pose a threat to Putin's power. And that risk certainly outweighs the benefit of a single opposition leader being silenced (when someone else will just take his place).

A very likely possibility for me that it was someone from the regional government acting on his own accord, or some other politician that Navalny has compromising material on. Whoever it was, this situation is very inconvenient for the Federal Government.

Or could it be foreign interference, to destabilize the internal political situation in Russia? Perhaps, but unlike everyone else, I will not jump to any conclusions.

Alright, I'm finished. You may now call me a Kremlin bot.",01c862c0ab0e22758647b1cc6e4e2bb7,remove,il7in0,5f5746e7f32e7900092d04c1

I think there has to be a better way to accomplish the goal of ""trying to learn from witnesses, uncover details, or improve legislation"" without removing cameras altogether, because sometimes cameras capture moments that amplify how important something was, such as the [John McCain thumbs down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWeayFHsH90). Certain moments can't adequately be captured in writing, and the video helps relay the information better. However, I think it is important to acknowledge the problem that exists, which is that often times during testimony, Senators or House Reps don't even pretend to be interested in what the witness is saying. You can watch basically any Senate or House hearing with witnesses in the last several years and it's just....painful to watch, quite frankly. 

For example, [Robert Mueller's Testimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFIoVAMSLX0). Specifically, watch how prominent Republicans such as Jim Jordan question Mr. Mueller.

The Dr. Fauci interview mentioned in the realclearpolitics.com article was on Feb. 29, when there were still a lot of unknowns about the virus. In an interview with ['60 Minutes' on Mar. 8th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t_e7dgI), Dr. Fauci had started to say that some people should wear masks: ""...when you think masks, you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill.""

In a [May 15th interview with FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/outdated-fauci-video-on-face-masks-shared-out-of-context/), Dr. Dean Winslow explained that the science around the novel coronavirus had evolved since Dr. Fauci's Mar. 8th interview: ""In early March, so few patients had been tested that public health officials didnâ€™t yet know that people could spread the virus without showing symptoms. That was just not known at that point.""

And by [Apr. 3](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-dr-fauci-wants-you-to-know-about-face-masks-and-staying-home-as-virus-spreads#transcript), Dr. Fauci was recommending that ""...when people go out and are in a situation where they might come into closer contact, that they wear that mask."" So, it appears that as Dr. Fauci and other health officials gained more information, their recommendations changed. But at an April 3 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump was [still downplaying the virus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/facts-check-trump-coronavirus-briefing-april-3/index.html) and stating that it would go away, not changing his stance much despite the information we now know he had.

Dr. Fauci's recent comments that Trump never distorted anything that he spoke to Trump about isn't directly related to anything Trump said in Woodward's interviews. It's also just his opinion. In my opinion, the fact Trump refused to wear a mask for so long went directly against what Dr. Fauci and the CDC were recommending, and thus distorted the message.",6e4a41284a15ab76d765d032b940d19e,confirm_ham,ipjzsk,5f595897f32e7900092d189b

To wit:

1. Was Cohen engaged in a professional capacity or was this simply a favor for a friend?  If the former, isn't this a violation of attorney/client privilege?  If the latter, this isn't illegal, but it sure doesn't make Cohen look great if he's selling his friend(s) out in order to turn a buck.
2. According to the story, Cohen told CNN â€œthere is absolutely no connection between the photos and my personal request to the Falwells to assist the Trump campaign.â€�   Now he's intimating the opposite.  That means he was was either lying then or he's lying now.  Now exactly a great source.
3. Cohen, of course, has other credibility issues.  Most notably, his tenuous relationship with the truth.

4. It's notable that Cohen stops juuuuust short of completing the linkage between the suppression of the photos and the endorsement.  This seems to be both important and by design.

So was California removing civil rights

https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_16,_Repeal_Proposition_209_Affirmative_Action_Amendment_(2020)

Proposition 16 is a constitutional amendment that would repealÂ Proposition 209, passed inÂ 1996, from theÂ California Constitution. Proposition 209 stated that discrimination and preferential treatment were prohibited in public employment, public education, and public contracting on account of a person's or group's race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. Therefore, Proposition 209 banned the use ofÂ affirmative actionÂ involving race-based or sex-based preferences in California.[1]
Without Proposition 209, the state government, local governments, public universities, and other political subdivisions and public entities wouldâ€”within the limits of federal lawâ€”be allowed to develop and use affirmative action programs that grant preferences based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, and national origin in public employment, public education, and public contracting.[1]

For the same reason the CDC [lied  about the effectiveness of masks](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/502890-fauci-why-the-public-wasnt-told-to-wear-masks) in order to stop people from hoarding them and  depriving life-saving medical professionals from accessing them.

A society is a psychology engine, and one that doesn't always act rationally. I'm old enough to remember May of this year. Like most places around the country, many people in my neighborhood were hoarding food and water...as though Covid would somehow shutdown the local water processing plants, even though media and politicians [said that wasn't necessary.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/there-s-no-good-reason-to-hoard-anything-especially-food) My local grocery store was completely sold out of toilet paper and many other common items.

Early on, it was thought that Covid could have a fatality rate of 10%, but medical experts warned  that this was likely wrong because [early on in a pandemic it's difficult to gauge fatality](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/13/case-fatality-rate-coronavirus-severity/) because most infections aren't reported, and only the most extreme cases go to a hospital where they can be tracked.

If Trump had run around telling everyone that 10% x 330 million = 33 million Americans would die, you really think that would have been a smart thing for him to do?

I get that this sub is frequently mostly by people who hate Trump,  and even though this whole ""Trump downplayed Covid"" is an [old political attack from last spring](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/33-times-trump-downplayed-the-coronavirus/2020/03/05/790f5afb-4dda-48bf-abe1-b7d152d5138c_video.html),  you really should think about it scientifically.

I'm not sure what you're asking here. Democrats aren't downplaying the virus *now*.

Just days after the China travel ban, Biden called Trump [xenophobic](https://www.statesman.com/news/20200330/fact-check-did-biden-call-trump-lsquoxenophobicrsquo-for-china-travel-restrictions), which the media later tried to rewrite as just a general comment about Trump and not specifically addressing the travel ban.

approvecomment,">~~Yes, please advertise how Trump enacted effective policy that Democrats  everywhere now follow while also stopping people from panicking.~~

The ""effectiveness"" of the policy is not mentioned or implied in the article. The point being made is that while Trump was making ""ineffective"" policy changes (I think I can claim they were ineffective if you look at the [much higher rates of infection in the US](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)), he was lying to the American public and down-playing the danger of the virus. In my opinion that is an important finding. It would imply you cannot believe what Trump says, even when it comes to something that might kill you.

The Dr. Fauci interview mentioned in the realclearpolitics.com article was on Feb. 29, when there were still a lot of unknowns about the virus. In an interview with ['60 Minutes' on Mar. 8th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t_e7dgI), Dr. Fauci had started to say that some people should wear masks: ""...when you think masks, you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill.""

In a [May 15th interview with FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/outdated-fauci-video-on-face-masks-shared-out-of-context/), Dr. Dean Winslow explained that the science around the novel coronavirus had evolved since Dr. Fauci's Mar. 8th interview: ""In early March, so few patients had been tested that public health officials didnâ€™t yet know that people could spread the virus without showing symptoms. That was just not known at that point.""

And by [Apr. 3](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-dr-fauci-wants-you-to-know-about-face-masks-and-staying-home-as-virus-spreads#transcript), Dr. Fauci was recommending that ""...when people go out and are in a situation where they might come into closer contact, that they wear that mask."" So, it appears that as Dr. Fauci and other health officials gained more information, their recommendations changed. But at an April 3 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump was [still downplaying the virus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/facts-check-trump-coronavirus-briefing-april-3/index.html) and stating that it would go away, not changing his stance much despite the information we now know he had.

Dr. Fauci's recent comments that Trump never distorted anything that he spoke to Trump about isn't directly related to anything Trump said in Woodward's interviews. It's also just his opinion. In my opinion, the fact Trump refused to wear a mask for so long went directly against what Dr. Fauci and the CDC were recommending, and thus distorted the message.",6e4a41284a15ab76d765d032b940d19e,confirm_ham,ipjzsk,5f5a99b0f32e7900092d238d

Spouting (unfounded) ""public optimism"" is in no way whatsoever anywhere near the same to what Trump said on tape to Woodward.

Trump has handled the crisis poorly and with ignorance.

The issue of COVID and wearing masks should not have to be something that is politicized, yet Trump has [continually done so](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-coronavirus-democrats-new-hoax-n1145721).",86d18e8d7341a66d3e5a4a5f004f922c,remove,iq2ppp,5f5a99b0f32e7900092d2399

And while he technically was in his home countryâ€™s soil by visiting a Saudi Embassy in Istanbul, itâ€™s not the same and enough to say this is an extrajudicial assassination and not simply enforcing the law.

I also want to be a little clearer as to what Iâ€™m criticizing here. Not imposing sanctions for this (which we would can assume is the usual â€˜protectionâ€™ a single US resident/citizen would have) is absolutely within Trumpâ€™s purview. Protecting MBS from consequences is not. That (and not warning him if they had intelligence to indicate this was happening) is what violates the the protection implied by issuing the visa and therefore exile.

Imagine if a Chinese journalist did exactly the same thing. They were being persecuted and sought exile by means of getting a visa. They got hired by the Post and briefly went to a Chinese embassy in Japan or another country without direct political ties to China. If they were kidnapped and murdered, the president can  choose whether impose sanctions while balancing a larger foreign policy strategy. If the US helped China get out trouble for it, this clearly suggests that the visa and exile granted is worthless.

Even outside of moral reasons, why would you grant a visa if you support the Saudiâ€™s persecution of him?",c3b61b6abe2d242cb4be2ced32c2d39d,remove,iqbfy1,5f5ace6cf32e7900092d254f

removecomment,"That's a fair point.  Almost nobody in the country took the threat seriously back in mid-March, despite warnings from epidemiologists that we all had access to.  Singling out the President's failure without also acknowledging our larger national failure does have an element of hypocrisy.  That said, I don't think the larger equivalency you're drawing here is justified.

The virus was able to spread so far in U.S. because so many people have continued not to take it seriously, ignoring basic precautions like social distancing and masks, throughout the crisis.  The protests were a small part of that, but the large majority has been the countless millions of people continuing to go to restaurants, movies, live church services, parties, and so on.  What the country needed was a leader who could inspire the people to change their behavior, and who would be willing to pressure local governments to take the threat seriously.

Trump's constant downplaying of the threat, his refusal to push for restrictions, refusal to wear a mask and so on, have had the exact opposite effect.  He's contributed, probably substantially, to the national apathy that's caused us to be the worst hit first world country in the world by this virus.

Would Biden have done better?  We can't know for certain.  I think he probably would have been more willing to shift gears when the threat became more than theoretical, instead of constantly doubling-down out of an unwillingness to admit failure.  Maybe you disagree, but the speculative failure of a different president can't justify the very real failure of the one we have.",d2277f2c19422eb6aac4106d80febc53,remove,iqw6zx,5f5c0bfff32e7900092d30d7

Authors retract major COVID-19 paper on effects of hydroxychloroquine
A major study on the effects of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients was retracted from a leading medical journal Thursday after doctors and scientists raised questions about the validity of the data.

The study had concluded patients taking the anti-malaria drug had a higher risk of death than those who were not taking the medication, leading some researchers to suspend their clinical trials.

* [Caputo is also a long term associate of disgraced political strategist Roger Stone, who was found guilty in November of lying to Congress and witness tampering as part of Robert Mueller's Russia probe. Caputo was interviewed as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. He was not charged with any offenses.](https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-caputo-hhs-trump-loyalist-ukraine-roger-stone-2020-4)

* [Caputo moved to Russia in 1994 after the fall of the Soviet Union and advised Boris Yeltsin while working for the U.S. Agency for International Development. Speier noted that in 2000, he worked with the Russian conglomerate Gazprom Media to â€œimprove Putinâ€™s image in the United States.â€�](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/14/ny-political-consultant-says-he-never-putins-image-consultant/480080001/)

A major study on the effects of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients was retracted from a leading medical journal Thursday after doctors and scientists raised questions about the validity of the data.

The study had concluded patients taking the anti-malaria drug had a higher risk of death than those who were not taking the medication, leading some researchers to suspend their clinical trials.

removecomment,"I think this constant diatribe on ""the media"" and if ""the media"" has been fair is impossible to talk about in the abstract. Which media? 

The Trump presidency has been one norm shattering, corrupt action after another. Nothing about it has been normal. The fact that a wide cross section of media companies have taken issues with his actions every day for the last 5 years isn't evidence the media is biased. It's evidence that something unusual is happening - either some kind of hitherto unexposed and wide ranging media bias, or a norm shattering presidency. 

To answer the question of if the media is biased, we would need an informed conversation about how unusual Trumps actions have been, and if ""the media"" response is appropriate. 

To answer that we need to talk about specific actions, and responses from specific media outlets.

Do I think the NYT has been fair? Yes on the whole I do. I think Lawfare has been fair etc. 

Do I think Breitbart has been fair, or Fox has been fair, or Blue State Daily has been fair? Nope, and they have historically biased and not very factual reporting. I also think a lot of TV news shows aren't very high quality. 

But then, isn't that the point of looking for factual news reporting, vs just identifying a tug of war between the monolithic ""media"" vs Trump. All media is not the same quality. 
If trusty worthy media outlets are calling out the Trump presidency, we should trust them. 
If historically biased media outlets are saying something different, we should be skeptical of their demonstrated biases.

Surely the main stream outrage against Trump is demonstrable of main stream outrage. Perhaps the main stream genuinely thinks Trump is a bad president. Why is that bias?",38e2216dc3dc2cb196cbf4bab0d83541,remove,isjxc3,5f5fd073f32e7900092d4fc1

To answer the question of if the media is biased, we would need an informed conversation about how unusual Trumps actions have been, and if ""the media"" response is appropriate. 

To answer that we need to talk about specific actions, and responses from specific media outlets.

Do I think the [NYT](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/) has been fair? Yes on the whole I do. I think [Lawfare](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lawfare-blog/) has been fair etc. 

Do I think [Breitbart](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/) has been fair, or [Fox News](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fox-news/) has been fair, or [Blue State Daily](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/blue-state-daily/) has been fair? Nope, and they have historically biased and not very factual reporting. I also think a lot of TV news shows aren't very high quality. 

But then, isn't that the point of looking for factual news reporting, vs just identifying a tug of war between the monolithic ""media"" vs Trump. All media is not the same quality. 
If trustworthy media outlets are calling out the Trump presidency, we should trust them. If historically biased media outlets are saying something different, we should be skeptical of their demonstrated biases.

And what actions? 

- [Pardoning war criminals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-shouldnt-forget-what-whistleblower-seals-told-us-about-eddie-gallagher/2019/12/29/7ce7e0f0-28c9-11ea-b2ca-2e72667c1741_story.html)

- [Involving foreign countries in providing election contributions in exchange of military support](https://www.vox.com/2019/11/12/20954985/impeachment-trump-quid-pro-quo)

- [Having the justice department intervene in a lawsuit against him by somebody accusing him of rape](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/nyregion/donald-trump-jean-carroll-lawsuit-rape.html)

These are not common actions from presidents. You might expect some response from reasonable media sources. 

Surely the mainstream outrage against Trump is demonstrable of main stream outrage. Perhaps the main stream genuinely thinks Trump is a bad president. Why is that bias?",38e2216dc3dc2cb196cbf4bab0d83541,unspam,isjxc3,5f5fe7e4f32e7900092d50c2

2. Trump knew it was serious... and was trying to downplay its effects publicly. Maybe you can disagree with that strategy. I can appreciate that. But hearing that was the stance, and saying it was Trump being negligent or willfully ""killing people"" is just asinine. Of course the President didn't want to start a panic.

Science is methodical and procedural; it does not take sides. Good science creates a best guess, creates hypothetical scenarios (experiements) and records results, drawing a best guess conclusion from said resulting data. Also known as the scientific method.


>A scientific magazine standing up for Science against a threat - and that threat is not â€œrepublicansâ€� or â€œconservativesâ€�, it is â€œman who does not believe in many existential aspects of scienceâ€�.

removecomment,"Well many people mocked Trump for suggesting that we should rake the forest, and blame climate change for forest fires. But actually , the new environmentalist forest policies are directly to blame for the fires: we refuse to pick up dead wood, because it creates habitats for insects and rodents or whatever, but all of this dead wood dries up and lights on fire very easily, causing uncontrollable fires. The link with global warming is a lot less obvious. Simply we cannot actually link global warming with droughts. Yes a hot surface will dry up faster ok, but in a closed system, where 2/3 of the surface is water, higher temperatures actually probably lead to more rain, though it is very complex and we are not sure. People love to blame Trump for being anti-science, but even the IPCC say that we cannot link global warming to chaotic weather or droughts.

There is no saying how ""we did"" in the US because unlike many European and other countries our deaths never started approaching zero yet.

On top of that, the US population is far more spread out than most European countries which should have made it much easier to contain, not apparently harder than all but three (so far). On top of that we are comparing one government (the world's most powerful and richest) to 30 some odd separate governments, who cannot control their neighbors' policies at all. I could keep going, but I'm trying something new.

At what point would you consider the US response to have been poor or ""horrible"" if you don't already? How many Americans would have to die given the facts we know about the virus (cfr, r value, etc) to get you to think we could have done better as the world's superpower? And how much has that number changed for you over time even though the facts of the virus have been known for months?

Unfounded is the wrong term here. The article you link is basically a literary exaggeration of well-known limitations with modeling. The data used for the modeling is perfectly sound. The models themselves are based on sound principles. Just no model will be absolutely correct when the behavior of the agent isn't well described. 

There's no apology to be made here; the governments involved acted on worst-case scenarios produced by models that had a basic working knowledge of pandemics and incomplete information of SarsCov-2 specifically. 

What would they apologize for? Not using the best-case scenario models?

Millions/billions of lives depend on fossil fuels and it isn't replaced as easily as you'd like to think. If you want it to get replaced, you have to have something available and ready to replace it with, and you need to have someone somewhere willing to pay that price. 

How much are you personally willing to sacrifice? Do you think we'll discover some new technology later that makes the transition easier at that time than it is now? Where exactly on the timeline is the point that results in minimal human suffering? If we transition next week, then billions will die. If we transition in 100 years, then billions will die.

**July 18th** [Trump says he won't call for a mask mandate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/calendar-confusion-february-august-trump-s-mixed-messages-masks-n1236088) 

**September 15th** - [Trump doesn't wear a mask, and falsely criticizes Biden for not calling for a mask mandate. ](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-criticizes-biden-on-national-mask-mandate-biden-not-president-2020-9)

So not only does he not call for a mandate for months, and still doesn't, despite it being the best guidance from the CDC. He also doesn't even model good behavior. And then somehow finds it in himself to falsely criticize another person for not doing something he himself hasn't done. 

It does seem to me there is a *little* more he could have done to change things.

>New York is a case study of doing everything wrong, in spite of warnings from the President and his advisors, and they suffered as a result. New York still has one of the highest death rate from the virus, with 1,704 deaths per million residents, compared to Florida's 602 per million -- that is nearly three times Florida's rate.

Yet in the last week New York is at **0.1** deaths per 100k, whereas Florida is at **4** and it increased by 35% in just the last week. 
You can certainly criticize New York for their response when the virus first surfaced, and they became overwhelmed. The healthcare system being overwhelmed spiked the death rate. It explains why their death rate is much higher that other states in proportion to their case count. 

I'm not sure how you justify focusing on them **now**, when they have it under control, and States like Florida have a death rate 10 times higher, even after months of time to prepare and act on the latest information. 

Florida has almost 50% more cases adjusted for population than NY, and they have it **now**, months after the virus appeared and the techniques for managing it are understood, at a time when States are trying to open up again.

[In the first three months after the travel *restrictions* went into effect on February 2, 2020, more than 8,000 Chinese and foreign nationals entered the U.S. from the restricted territories.  Additionally, more than 27,000 Americans returned from mainland China in the first month alone, and US officials lost track of more than 1,600 who were supposed to be monitored for virus exposure](https://apnews.com/d227b34b168e576bf5068b92a03c003d)

It was not a travel ""ban"" if that many people were able to get around it.

You also talk a lot about New York, which has a population density of [5,318/sq mi in the metro area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area) as if it is a good analogue to Florida.

It would be logical to assume that a virus will have a disproportionate ability to spread in dense population centers compared with less dense populations.

What happened in New York also does not absolve President Trump of any errors on his part in managing the virus nationally.

There is also the issue that the Federal Government may have [significantly overpaid for ventilators](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-white-house-paid-up-to-500-million-too-much-for-these-ventilators-congressional-investigators-say) and there is current investigation for evidence of fraud, waste, and abuse.

There is also the issue that the Trump State Department delivered [17 tons of PPE to China](https://www.state.gov/briefing-with-usaid-deputy-administrator-bonnie-glick-and-director-of-u-s-foreign-assistance-resources-james-l-richardson-on-u-s-foreign-assistance-in-response-to-covid-19/) before we ended up having a significant shortage of PPE for our own healthcare workers.  To be fair, I'm not against providing this aid but ultimately we did have a shortfall of necessary protective equipment which may have been less severe if this hadn't happened.

In short, I disagree with you that ""I do not believe there is anything trump could have done better that would have been within his authority.""

The vast majority of people have already been exposed to H1N1 before it reached epidemic levels anyways (H1N1 literally used to be the Spanish Flu). When H1N1 first arose on the global stage, millions died because there was no base immunity - no one had really been exposed before. 

The same thing has happened with SARS-CoV-2. No one has had exposure to it previously so it's natural that the first epidemic (which became a pandemic) would be much worse than an epidemic for a disease that has already infected people in past generations.

So you don't need masks for a disease that the global population has experienced for over 100 years already. You do need masks for brand new diseases.

""He didnâ€™t do it. I mean, he never did it.""

People are blaming the President for mismanaging the pandemic, and it's easier to make that argument stick if you have a better idea for how to manage one, and it's even better if you can show that you were giving better advice at the time. I'm guessing the President is aware of this and is trying to say that he wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary in that moment.

Yes, that could be incorrect. Yes, I see the transcript says ""don't"" instead of ""didn't"" - Trump dodged the question and deflected blame. Yes, a statement like ""he never said at the time"" is certainly open for fact checkers to dispute.

From the abstract-

""Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.""

The evidence is still inconclusive on masks in community settings. Do I think it has a place in pandemic protocol? Yes, specifically in hospitals, eldercare and public transport. But most other institutions, with the evidence I have seen right now, don't seem like they would benefit from mandated mask wearing, either because risk of transmission is so low (ie. Outside) or the amount of time in the location would be too great for there to be a benefit (school)

[Here's another Trump sound bite with similar talking points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQs-NCN9jq8). 2:00 to the end is the relevant bit.

Regarding AP's headline,

> In reality, Austria is a country situated in the heart of Europe, where people do not live in the forest, but rather with the forest and in a close, sustainable relationship with the natural environment. Trees cover almost half of our nationâ€™s territory.

>You will find no â€œforest citiesâ€� in Austria. You will find habitats closely intertwined with forests. Vienna, our capital, is surrounded by a green belt and draws a large proportion of its drinking water from the mountains and forests just an hour away.

>Yes, Austria is a forest country; yes Austrians know, love and appreciate their forests. After all, around 300,000 people in Austria make their living directly or indirectly from forestry.

Since the discussion of exploding trees is a big part of this story, [here's an article](https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/09/15/once-and-for-all-trees-do-not-explode/) that talks about it. It's not a great article, but some nuggets from it:

- The author has 33 years experience fighting wildfires and hasn't seen it
- He doesn't know a ""reputable"" firefighter that has
- John McCain alleged that trees explode in 2016
- Trump could have just watched â€œRed Skies of Montanaâ€� and drawn a wrong conclusion
- Some guy claims to have a photo of an exploding tree. It's...decidedly not conclusive.
- Also notes that most forests in CA are on federal land, which makes you wonder if the onus is really on CA here

Elsewhere, Wikipedia notes that trees may explode because of lightning, and supposedly eucalyptus trees can explode.

From [a report about the fire](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/09/wildfire-map-evacuations-california-oregon-washington/5755838002/):

>â€œOur entire community is gone,'' Brown said. ""Everyone is evacuated. We could hear the trees exploding as this red glow came up over the hillside.""

Heard, not seen. If it's a myth, maybe it propagates because of how burning/breaking trees sound?

Here's an [interesting article](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/understand-growing-wildfire-threat-look-tree-rings) from 2018:

>The single most conspicuous fact from the tree rings is that the record exists at all. In other words, the fact that trees could have survived the forest fires of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries and most of the 19th indicates a kind of fire very different from the explosive conflagrations of our times.

>Today when fires start, they no longer run along the ground and singe the trees. They roar up the â€œfuel ladderâ€� of forest floor debris and thickets of smaller trunks, then explode in the crowns of trees. They jump from treetop to treetop, killing all the trees, leveling the forest, and leaving in their wake an utterly changed landscape.

> Iâ€™m Olivia Troye. I was Homeland Security and Counterterrorism adviser to Vice President Pence, and served as Vice President Penceâ€™s lead staff member on the Covid-19 response. You know, Iâ€™d been on the Covid Task Force from day one. I mean, the virus was very unpredictable at the beginning. There were a lot of unknowns.
> 
> But towards the middle of February, we knew it wasnâ€™t a matter of if Covid would become a big pandemic here in the United States. It was a matter of when. But the president didnâ€™t want to hear that, because his biggest concern was that we in were an election year. And, how is this going to affect what he considered to be his record of success? It was shocking to see the president saying that the virus was a hoax, saying that everythingâ€™s okay, when we knew that itâ€™s not.
> 
> The truth is he doesnâ€™t actually care about anyone else but himself. He made a statement once. It was very striking. I never forgot it, because it pretty much defined who he was. When we were on a task force meeting, the president said, â€œMaybe this covid thing is a good thing. I donâ€™t like shaking hands of people. I donâ€™t have to shake hands with these â€˜disgustingâ€™ people.â€� Those disgusting people are the same people that he claims to care about. These are the people still going to his rallies today who have complete faith in who he is.
> 
> If the president had taken this virus seriously, or if he had actually made the effort to tell how serious it was, he would have slowed the virus spread. He would have saved lives.
> 
> It was the opportunity and honor of a lifetime to be able to serve in the White House.
> 
> I put my heart and soul into this role every single day.
> 
> But at some points I would come home at night. I would look myself in the mirror, and say, â€œAre you really making a difference? Does it matter?â€� Because no matter how hard you work and what you do, the president is going to do something that is detrimental to keeping Americans safe, which is why you signed up for this role. It was awful. It is. It was terrifying.  
> 
> I have been a Republican for my entire life. I am a McCain Republican. I am a Bush Republican and I am voting for Joe Biden because I truly believe we are at a time of constitutional crisis. At this point, itâ€™s country over party.",700594b109fc2ef9bffc0a4ee2cbebe7,confirm_ham,iv534g,5f65141cc2d7bf0009f10101

This was not in contention, that is whataboutism. Faulting democrats has no bearing on how republicans are acting now. Pointing out others' hypocrisy is of no consequence to the topic.

Further, OP said:

The topic is republican hypocrisy and partisan politics. Pointing out that democrats may do this too is a diversion.

I won't be engaging in that.

  Im still waiting for you to identify exactly what rights you claim the Republicans have infringed  on?


 Blaiming the senate for not approving of a justice they don't agree with is exactly what the advise and consent portion of the constitution is designed for.   If trump nominates a judge during the election year, just as obama did per your article, then no norm will have been broken.  If the senate approves of the confirmation then the normal process has been fulfilled.

  The gripes democrats have is that the voters during obama's term decided they wanted a senate to have a republican majority to make such decisions on obama's judicial nominations.  Currently the voters want a senate with a republican majority and a republican president.

Straight  from the ap

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â€” The newly elected district attorney in Portland, Oregon, said Tuesday that under a new policy, his office will not prosecute people who have been arrested since late May on non-violent misdemeanor charges during protests in Oregonâ€™s largest city.
The new policy recognizes the outrage and frustration over a history of racial injustice that has led to more than 70 nights of sustained, often violent protest in Portland as well as the more practical realities of the court system, which is running more than two months behind in processing cases because of COVID-19, Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said.""


>The second source actually say the local authorities directly stated the opposite, but some dispatchers said otherwise.  I trust the police chief more,personally.

Why?

You mean the ones making  the racist policy that BLM is complaining about, the ones that put choke holds in the police handbook? Suddenly they are to be trusted?

I'd disagree.  It takes very little effort to fill in some bubbles and stuff it in the envelope, then put a stamp on it to mail it.

I'm not saying mail in voting is bad, mind you.  I strongly support [Washington State's universal vote by mail](https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/faq_vote_by_mail.aspx) for example.  My argument is that if a person don't care enough to follow a basic rule, or to put this another way, is so irresponsible in their duty as to fail to follow clear and simple directions, then I personally don't believe they put care into their opinion or the issues & candidates they tried to voted on and should not be counted.

 It is similar reasoning to that behind [preventing felons from voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement_in_the_United_States), except instead of arguing that they violated the social contract and can't be trusted, I am arguing that they don't care enough to follow basic instructions mandated by the laws in that state and therefore cannot be trusted

> I would also question why losing secrecy in the ballot invalidates the vote.

Because the laws of the state say so, as made clear by the court ruling.  That's reason enough.

In this regard, Joe was problematic because of his relation to Hunter.  

At best, you are alleging that Hunter Biden's actions were problematic for the administration, not that Joe Biden was. Remember, Joe Biden is not Hunter Biden, cannot control his relationship to Hunter, cannot control Hunter (again, he's an independent adult), did not dirrect Hunter to take a job at Burisma, did not help Hunter get a job at Burisma, and was part of the administration before Hunter Biden joined Burisma.

The only one who took an action that could be construed as problematic is Hunter Biden, and even that would be a stretch. What's more, even if I were to accept you attributing the responsibility for Hunter Biden's actions to Joe Biden, it still would not support your initial claim, because what you said was:

> No ""wrongdoing"" just massively problematic international policy for the guy who campaigned on being a global/foreign policy expert.

I mean the list goes on and on and on.  It's fucking ridiculous. 

On the party side - who the fuck is the GOP kidding?  One issue voters for abortion laws ignore the 200k dead and won't support expectant mothers with extra stimulus for their unborn child.  It's alive right!?  Big Jesus family party won't even do paternal leave, family planning based in science not theocracy, nir early childhood education.  Schrodingers GOP Baby, alive enough to oppress women, not alive enough for a stimulus.  Let's not forget the pure projection/hypocrisy from the Supreme Socialists Party (GOP) - fucking actions dude, a party that denounces any public good as evil socialism while they exist to give billions in subsidies to corporations (welfare socialism), irresponsible tax cuts for the donor class (socialism), tax loopholes that create an effective 0% Corp. tax rate (corporatist socialism) , deregulation that hurts us (socialism), regulatory-capture that destroys the public good/services because God forbid the peasants get something like clean air and infrastructure.   But wait there is more GOP compliance, immediately try to gut the ACA with... 3.5 years later.... No plan.  No plan when they were going to fuck over millions of Americans, and no plan now but It's coming.  Sure it is GOP.  Can't forget the largest deficit in history BEFORE the pandemic, great fiscal conservativism! Massive debt, abandoning our Kurdish allies, abdicating ME Hegemony to Russia. Damn, I have soooo much more to add to that and it doesn't matter.  (appointments, no action to hold votes that help Americans, but immediate action on their hypocrite Supreme Court BS) None of it matters apparently to Republicans cus as long as they are okay, fuck everyone else.  

Big business and growth party ignores climate change, misses out on years of research and development while China develops green tech and sells it world wide.  Ouch GNP, coulda been a massive growth factor.  Another GOP complicity with Trump's idiocy that's fucking this country over. 

 Shit, don't even get me started on Democrats with their virtue signaling and theatrics while signing off on unlimited military spending and mass surveillance.  They are almost worst because they give you hope that our tax money might actually benefit tax payers, what a thought, but they always half measure it. 

Man, to think the GOP isn't in complete lockstep with Trump must be blissful ignorance or tribalism.   I don't get how you can separate the party from the cult of personality.  Because every action, every lie, every horror that the GOP leads us to tells me - yeah, they don't give a fuck about us nor do they govern that way- GOP 100% supports Trump and putting out distancing soundbites after everything that's happened is just cartoonish. History shows that when the GOP gets in power they leave America in recessions, pointless wars, body counts as high as a world war, massive debt/deficits, curtailed civil rights, and they leave the Democrat party to clean up their mess, over and over.

Shit I had to delete most of this cus it was soooo much.   There are so many examples of outright hypocrisy, lies, spineless complicity, and authoritarian rhetoric/actions that no Republican would have the social maturity to admit they've been had.  I have no allusions about the democrats either, but the GOP is orders of magnitudes worse.  Actions.  Actions.  Actions. No whataboutism, actions.

TLDR:  GOP/Trump's actions can't be considered anything other than destructive to America.

Considering the article is about the GOP stating that they disagree with Trump and will ensure a peaceful transfer of power, what source do you have to back your implicit assertion that this is false?

It's what I've been asking you to source for quite a while, and which at this point I'm just going to assume is a statement without any backing since I couldn't find a source, and you couldn't provide one to me either.

You've linked Trump's statements. I don't think anyone is disputing them. I'm disputing your claim that the GOP's statements that they do not stand by Trump's statements, and they will instead ensure a peaceful transfer of power, is a lie.

I'd like a source for those statements.

Looking solely at wars, lets look at the past 100 years, including only those against other countries, and the date they each started or the US intervened, and which party the president at the time belonged to.

- World War I - 1917 - Democrat
- World War II - 1939 - Democrat
- Korean War - 1950 - Democrat
- Laotian War - 1953 - **Republican**
- Vietnam War - 1955 (conflict began) & 1965 (increase in presence) - **Republican** (began) & Democrat (increased presence)
- Thailand War - 1965 - Democrat
- Dominican War - 1965 - Democrat
- Korean DMZ War - 1966 - Democrat
- Bolivian War - 1966 - Democrat
- Cambodian War - 1967 - Democrat
- South Zaire War - 1978 - Democrat
- Libyan Interventions (Gulf of Sidra & Lybia) - 1981 - **Republican**
- Intervention in Lebanon - 1982 - **Republican**
- Invasion of Grenada - 1983 - **Republican**
- Tanker War - 1987 - **Republican**
- Invasion of Panama - 1989 - **Republican**
- Gulf War - 1990 - **Republican**
- Iraqi No-Fly Zone - 1991 - **Republican**
- Somali War - 1992 - **Republican**
- Bosnian War - 1992 - **Republican**
- Kosovo War - 1998 - Democrat
- War in Afghanistan - 2001 - **Republican**
- Iraq War - 2003 - **Republican**
- Pakistani War - 2004 - **Republican**
- Somali War (Part 2) - 2007 - **Republican**
- Libyan War - 2011 - Democrat
- Intervention in Iraq - 2014 - Democrat
- Intervention in Syria - 2014 - Democrat
- Yemeni Civil War - 2015 - Democrat
- Intervention in Libya - 2015 - Democrat

I think it's significantly dishonest and far-fetched to boldly claim that engaging in wars is somehow partisan.

Same thing can be said about recessions, which rarely have anything to do with actions undertaken by a particular party (perhaps one could argue the Great Depression was extended by the actions of one, but still dishonest to act like it was intentional).

Too many sourceless statements to argue against so I won't follow-up on those.

They could very easily have been mistaken, if for example, they believed their grandfather was ""full-blooded"" native american, but really was himself only part native.

> Playing up an indian heritage that was basically nill.

It's clearly not ""basically nill"", since it is detectable and quantifiable with a dna test, as stated above. As for playing up their heritage, here is a quote from the [boston article](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2012/09/15/elizabeth-warren-family-native-american-heritage) you cited above:

> David Herring of Norman, Okla., one of Warrenâ€™s three brothers, said in an interview that even when he was a child his relatives were reluctant to talk about the familyâ€™s Native American heritage because â€œit was not popular in my family.â€™â€™

How this can be interpreted as "" Playing up an indian heritage "", I don't know.

The claim that they lied is not factual, and not supported by any of the article you cite.",062512f6041e1c40256c31f31a1138fc,unspam,j04eqv,5f70ee18dbe1ef0009d97717
