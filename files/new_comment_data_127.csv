But as federal law-enforcement officials continue to round up people suspected of involvement in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, and Joe Biden’s administration promises a crackdown on white-supremacist and anti-government radicals, extremists are on the verge of a crack-up, posting widely and worriedly about spies in their midst—“glowies.” That’s the term far-right groups use to describe people they suspect of being federal law-enforcement agents or informants infiltrating their communication channels, trying to catch them plotting violence, or prodding them into illegal acts.

>The term is in widespread use among extremists: On January 6, one Telegram user made their channel, which was popular with the far right, private because “nameless faceless glowies are joining.” Two days later, another person suggested that glowies would “float dead cop story, to redirect public attention and sympathy,” referring to the death of the Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was beaten with a fire extinguisher during the riot and later died.

Tesla already has a couple models with a 435 mile range, and is working on a battery that can get over 600 in the future.](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34775237/elon-musk-tesla-car-semi-range/) Compare this to a Toyota Corolla for instance to where you can get 600 miles on a full tank, and you can see how EVs are going to be competitive especially in high-density markets that will have the infrastructure put in faster.

[On top of that, Tesla's working on a million-mile battery](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a34620676/million-mile-batteries-theyre-coming/), which to save you the click gives the full total life of the battery part \~1,000,000 miles, or so they say. This means that you can take your existing battery out of your own car and transfer it to a new one to save on cost.

I've cited Tesla because they seem to be the ones that have revolutionized the space and are constantly breaking records.

Ford and GM have taken the plunge with GM last week [having a decent keynote at last week's CES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDFZqa422nI&ab_channel=Engadget) ([text source for mods](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gm-ces-2021-keynote-chevy-cadillac-flying-cars-concepts/) the previous link was directly to their keynote speech that's on YouTube) on EVs (including a weird flying car prototype) and partnering with Microsoft to go self-driving in an upcoming Chevy Cruise model.

,"In the US we have seen repeated statistically significant discrepancies between polls and results in areas that have voting systems that do not have a human-auditable paper trail vs areas that that do have a human-auditable paper trail track polls more accurately. 

As a background: 

* There large numbers of voting systems without an auditable paper trail in large areas of some states showing voting irregularities. ( (Note: some voting systems create a paper ""receipt"" that's not human readable - this paper ""receipt"" does not count as an auditable record) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]

* There are large sections of some states which had electronic-only (no paper trail) voting systems that have had a record of discrepancies and/or poor election machine security: [6], [7], [8]

But what's really telling is what happens when you change from all digital to voting systems to ones with a human editable paper trail. Just compare Georgia, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin in 2016 vs 2020.   In 2016 GA, OH, TX, and WI had massive discrepancies between polls and election results. Pundits kept talking about the ""Secret Trump/GOP supporter"" as a way to explain the discrepancy. But something changed between the 2016 and 2020 elections in GA that didn't happen in WI and TX and OH. 

In GA they changed to have the **entire state** to have human-readable, human-auditable balloting systems.  

The ""battleground"" states in 2020 which have had the largest discrepancies between exit polling and actual results, had a significant portion of machines that do not have a human-auditable paper receipt of the vote being recorded. Take [Ohio (PDF)](ftp://sosftp.sos.state.oh.us/free/publications/website/maps/votingSystems.pdf)  or [Wisconsin ](https://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/voting-equipment/voting-equipment-use) as examples where you see many counties with DRE (digital only) systems or QR Code marking systems that encodes the printed ballot in a way a human cannot read/see what the tabulating machine will actually record. 

Take Zapata County, Texas, a heavily democratic county which was predicted to be [Blue with moderate confidence](https://www.jameshatch.com/blog/2020/10/09/election-2020-texas-predictions-by-county/).  Zapata County recently switched to Verity Touch, a [paperless, unauditable touchscreen system](https://wwZapartintercivic.com/press-release/zapata-county-chooses-verity-for-new-voting-system/) [.](https://archive.is/wtp/dyskh) .  If you look at the [results](http://www.co.zapata.tx.us/upload/page/6427/docs/Results/11.03.2020_generalelectioncumulative.pdf) you'll see absentee voting, early voting  all consistently blue. Election day - you'll see all blue (even for TX supreme court) except ... for Trump vs Biden it's red. 

And the effect is that in GA polls matched election results. In TX, OH, and WI there was still the ""mysterious red shift"" [9] [9.5]

One thing interesting about the change in GA is that they also caught electoral fraud (or incompetence in election officials). In fact, in GA, the human-readable recount found a heavily Republican district cheated Biden out of +92 vote margin by not counting a batch of early voting ballots and fired the person responsible. [10], [11], [12]

The fact that polls can indicate where there are electoral system irregularities is not new [13]

So instead of focusing on the flaws of digital voting systems, just make electoral fraud extremely difficult to do by a human-readable ballot that's marked prior to scanning/digitizing and is available for recounts/audits. 

What the DEMS need to do in the next 100 days. Is pass a law with elections systems standards with teeth. perhaps stating that any state with election systems that do not have a human readable paper ballot (either BMD or scantronics) which allow for human auditable recounts will lose federal funds.

,"Like with any complex story, there are multiple angles to consider:

1. First, everyone involved in preparing for this event was probably legitimately reluctant to deploy the national guard for a protest. A large police force showing up to protests is considered ""bad optics"" to many, and it's an issue that DC's Mayor Bowser had been criticized for last year. Following widespread rioting in DC during the first two days of the George Floyd protests in 2020, over 5000 national guard troops had been deployed (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/national-guard-protests.html). That earned Bowser and Trump criticism last year and resulted in a confrontation between the two on policy around staffing protests. Accordingly, she only requested 340 national guard troops ahead of these recent DC rallies, and also sent a warning to federal agencies to not deploy additional troops without seeking approval and coordination with the city. This NPR article mentions that and so do other sources such as https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/532739-bowser-to-doj-pentagon-dc-isnt-requesting-federal-law-enforcement-to. All this supports Ex-Capitol Police Chief Sund's claim that his requests for additional troops *before* the incident were denied. Personally I do think the low number of troops requested beforehand was a critical error. There were tens of thousands of attendees in DC this last week for multiple planned rallies, and this was fully expected because these events were formally organized and had applied for (and received) permits (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/04/january-6-dc-protests-against-election-certification-could-violent/4132441001/). Note that the National Guard is now planning to deploy up to 15000 troops to DC for the coming few weeks (https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/11/politics/bowser-avoid-dc-biden-inauguration/index.html).

2. It seems there was a delay in approving national guard deployment during the riot, with Trump being the reason. Press Secretary McEnany put out a statement saying Trump directed the DC National Guard to deploy but this is countered by multiple sources. This fact check from Newsweek concludes that the DC NG was only deployed at Pence's approval, not Trump's, and that seeking his approval was a fallback after Trump was reluctant. This corroborates the claim by Ex-Capitol Police Chief Sund that his requests during the incident were denied multiple times: https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-did-trump-call-national-guard-after-rioters-stormed-capitol-1560186

3. The Capitol Police is a unique agency. It is tasked with protecting Congress, and it is managed by Congress and answers only to them. It has exclusive jurisdiction over the capitol grounds and it does not answer to POTUS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police). Pelosi asked the now former Capitol Police Chief to resign, but it is an odd request because this failure is as much an indictment of Congress in mismanaging this agency as it is the agency's own fault. Given the evidence supporting Sund's claim that his requests for help were denied, it does seem unfair to request his resignation with the info we have right now.

4. What's less clear is how many capitol police were on duty and how many rioters were involved. The NPR article claims 1400 capitol police were on the job, and 8000 rioters. However, other sources don't put the numbers this high. For example TMZ claims that only 500 capitol police were on duty, sourced from an unnamed person within the capitol police (https://www.tmz.com/2021/01/07/capitol-police-understaffed-ill-equipped-handle-capitol-rioters-tear-gas/). Journalists on the ground described the rioters as in the hundreds, not in the thousands (Politico reporter: https://twitter.com/tina_nguyen/status/1346943074086346753). My guess is there were 8000 people that marched from Trump's speech to the capitol, and a smaller number in the hundreds were actually rioting. The exact number of police officers on duty may provide hints as to whether they were simply overwhelmed or if they did not do their job (either on purpose or just due to incompetence). And if some of the allegations of capitol police ""allowing"" the riot to happen turn out to be true, then perhaps Sund was correctly asked to resign after all.",SharpBeat,,kv552u,gix6o9f

,"So much for ""you can always go make your own social media"". This change sets a scary precedent. Amazon, Apple, and Google are not social media platforms. They are the next layer down of infrastructure upon which a social media platform could be built, providing infrastructure cloud services, phones, and operating systems. Just like in the post-9/11 timeframe, one bad incident will get used to normalize worse policy. With this censorship and deplatforming now applied at this more basic layer, the floodgates are open for activists to deplatform content they disagree with at these more basic layers. No doubt, we'll also see them step up their aggression in attacking thought they deem problematic (""wrongspeak"").

Note that this article cites examples of Parler removing problematic content recently. Parler is just a small 30-person company experiencing a massive influx of new users and posts due to the events of the last few days and Trump being removed from Facebook and Twitter. They are not in a financial position to remove every last piece of offending content given how much traffic they are getting, and I think expecting them to be able to is simply not fair. This type of expectation is simply putting up competitive barriers so that no one can challenge the big incumbent social media platforms, who do have the financial ability to hire a large staff and moderate things better. And of course the time frames given for these expectations are just completely unrealistic.

The biggest problem with this move, however, is that Amazon, Apple, and Google are not applying the same standards across the board. Facebook and Twitter (and Instagram and others) have lots of problematic content. They are used by left-wing radicals to organize ""protests"" which are really riots, and involve criminal activity such as looting, property damage, vandalism, assault, arson, seizure of public property, and more. This has been true throughout 2020 but left-leaning groups have also organized past illegal gatherings at the capitol (https://www.allsides.com/blog/capitol-hill-breach-riot-coverage-demonstrates-media-bias) as well. All these groups however, continue to operate on these platforms and neither Apple nor Google nor Amazon have taken steps to ban those parties. Given the hundreds of riots, the massive economic damage, numerous deaths, and other results from riots all throughout 2020, how can big tech companies possibly justify going after Trump and Parler but not everyone else?

The answer is that they can't justify it. They are simply biased partisans, because they are headquartered in places with a far-left political culture (Bay Area, Seattle), because their staff share those biases, and because they want to build favor with the new incoming administration who has the power to regulate them because they're monopolistic.",SharpBeat,,ku69ca,giqg9ly

,"There isn't really anything good about this. If you look at Twitter's actual blog post on this (https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html), they don't make a very convincing case. The tweets they cite as inciting violence do nothing of the sort. It's just a lot of subjective, biased guesses being injected by Twitter's staff. Imagine if you said one thing but someone told you ""that's great, but I'm going to pretend you're saying this other different thing that is convenient for me and my politics"". That's basically what's going on here. Twitter is making HUGE leaps of imagination by citing things like Trump's plan to not attend Biden's inauguration as an incitement of violence and a justification for this ban.

What this does is set a precedent. Now Twitter, Facebook, and the rest are completely comfortable deciding what is allowed and disallowed speech. It is well-timed so they can kowtow to the new incoming administration, and perhaps dodge the anti-trust attention and regulation they deserve. Twitter's blog post demonstrates that these tech companies are willing to judge intent, claim impacts, and make up causal links without evidence, based solely on the political biases of their staff. This is scary, considering that these tech companies are comprised mostly of the progressive left and will become hostile to views that fall outside of that part of the political spectrum. It's also scary given their size and power, since these tech companies have more influence than most governments.

It is also telling that Twitter has not reprimanded others who have encouraged or incited illegal, harmful, or dangerous acts previously. In 2018 there were *multiple* incidents involving left-leaning activists raiding the capitol. Several were encouraged by politicians like AOC. She even directly participated in one directly, where Nancy Pelosi's office was occupied (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_Movement#November_2018_sit-in). These events went largely unnoticed despite there being hundreds of participants and dozens of arrests. This is clearly a double standard, and few outlets have the intellectual capacity or spine to call this out (notable exception: https://www.allsides.com/blog/capitol-hill-breach-riot-coverage-demonstrates-media-bias). We've also seen hundreds of riots in 2020 where activists and politicians set up/encouraged/led events that involved widespread property damage, arson, assaults, and even deaths. And yet across all of this, there were no bans, no calls for deplatforming, and near-constant gaslighting about ""mostly peaceful"" protests.

Now by applauding Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and others in their permanent ban of Trump, we are emboldening them to be the partisan authoritarians they want to be. I fully expect this normalization of censorship to go much further. What we're likely to see next are phone manufacturers banning what websites you can visit in your browser, desktop/laptop operating system manufacturers doing the same, ISPs deciding which websites can be accessed, and more. This is a huge detriment to open discourse since the notions of what is ""harmful"" or ""dangerous"" content are subjective.

,"Hogan's setting himself up nicely if he ever wants to run for President as a moderate Republican.

It'll be interesting to see if the party continues to divide itself along Trump lines — those that support Trump through and through and those that want to move on.

There's too many factors to count to see what will happen to the Republican Party from here on out with regards to Trump. Will he leave the U.S.? Will he try and expand his brand and bolster his base? Will he run again in 2024, and given recent events does he have a shot again?

With regard to Hogan though, he's a super popular Republican governor in an ultra-liberal state. Maryland's super blue because of all of the DC people plus Baltimore, and yet somehow Hogan's approval is the 2nd best in the nation.

In his tenure in Maryland, he's focused mostly on the fiscal sides of things and has stayed out of the social side [(e.g. he's supported cutting all taxes on retirement income and wanted to make Maryland more business-friendly, while at the same time staying out of gay marriage or abortion politics).](https://www.ontheissues.org/Larry_Hogan.htm)

He's at the end of his term as governor in 2022, which gives him more than enough time to plan for making a run at president in 2024. He's in his 60s, much younger than Biden, and has a good shot at winning the independents across the board.

His term as governor doesn't come without any criticism of course. [The 500,000 kits ordered for COVID-19 testing from South Korea proved to be useless.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hogan-korea-coronavirus-tests/2020/11/20/f048c1c8-251b-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html) Many can point to Baltimore City's murder rate as a failure from the governor (though that can be argued that the local government is mostly at fault here).

> “Was there a structural feeling that well, these are a bunch of conservatives, they’re not going to do anything like this? Quite possibly,” Davis said. “That’s where the racial component to this comes into play in my mind. Was there a lack of urgency or a sense that this could never happen with this crowd?

,"This 538 article is frequently incorrect or misleading:

1\. They call out the failure to post national guard troops before protests even began, but there were 340 of them already posted all over the city (not focused just on the capitol) and the Mayor of DC had specifically said she did not want more federal staff aiding in the protests, because she felt the local police department (MPD) was already well prepared for the event on their own with existing partners. Source: https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/532739-bowser-to-doj-pentagon-dc-isnt-requesting-federal-law-enforcement-to

2\. They criticize the national guard response during the June BLM protests in DC, claiming that troops were ""posted en masse around landmarks before a protest even began"". This is false. Those troops were posted after there were already widespread riots, fires, and damage to monuments/memorials. The famous photo of troops standing guard was on the steps of the Lincoln memorial, and it was after the Lincoln memorial previously sustained minor damage from BLM rioters. Remember, the Mayor of DC had to set a 7PM curfew due to the criminal rioting that had taken place. Sources: https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-orders-curfew and https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/troops-guarding-lincoln-memorial/ and https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/politics/dc-monuments-lincoln-memorial-defaced/index.html and https://www.newsweek.com/multiple-fires-white-house-george-floyd-protests-washington-dc-1507732

3\. This 538 article's primary data source, ACLED, seems biased because they water down criminality from the left. For example, they call ""CHAZ"" by its later public relations rebranded name of ""CHOP"", which does away with the 'autonomous zone' terminology and instead recasts the event as a virtuous 'protest'. ACLED also called CHAZ a ""protest encampment"" when it was in fact an illegal seizure of public infrastructure and property. Source: https://acleddata.com/2020/09/03/demonstrations-political-violence-in-america-new-data-for-summer-2020/ and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone

4\. This 538 article's primary data source, ACLED, seems inconsistent and inaccurate when it comes to classifying an event as a protest or a riot, or as peaceful or violent. As an example, their graph of riots versus protests in Washington state shows only a few sporadic riots. The word riot is defined in the dictionary as ""a tumultuous disturbance of the public peace by three or more persons assembled together and acting with a common intent"" (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/riot) and ACLED's own definition of ""rioting"" (Page 12 in their FAQ at https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2020/07/US-Crisis-Monitor_FAQs_Upd2November.pdf) is similar.

However, Seattle had riots that meet the above definitions almost every single day since George Floyd. There is a Seattle activist group called ""Everyday March"" that has blockaded roads and highways every single day, as their name implies, and they have documented their criminal activities in their own social media. Why does ACLED not record these as riots? Source: https://www.instagram.com/morningmarchseattle/

5\. This 538 article seems to ignore whether a left-wing or right-wing protest had prior evidence that would lead authorities to think that a police response would be needed. For a number of BLM- or antifa-affiliated events in 2020, there were several days of unrest, and after the first day it was clear what the policing needs would be. In the case of the recent capitol raid, no one anticipated significant rioting or something as brazen as invading the capitol, including the DC Mayor herself.

6\. This 538 article, and the ACLED research it depends on, attempt a statistical sleight of hand:

> Despite the fact that demonstrations associated with the BLM movement have been overwhelmingly peaceful, more than 9% — or nearly one in 10 — have been met with government intervention, compared to 3% of all other demonstrations.

> Over 5% of all events linked to the BLM movement have been met with force by authorities, compared to under 1% of all other demonstrations.

It may be true that a higher percentage of BLM demonstrations resulted in a police response, but isn't it also true that a higher percentage of BLM demonstrations involved criminal activity compared to other demonstrations? Note that a different analysis of the *same ACLED data* from a right-leaning source show that of all riots where the perpetrators’ affiliation was known, 95% were BLM-affiliated. So isn't that a clear and justified reason as to why BLM-associated events would be met with greater rates of government intervention and force than other events?

> GENEVA (30 December 2020) - A group of UN experts* said the pardons granted to four convicted private security contractors for war crimes in Iraq violated US obligations under international law, and called on all States parties to the Geneva Conventions to condemn the pardons.
> 
> The Blackwater Worldwide contractors were prosecuted and convicted of multiple criminal acts committed during a massacre at Nisour Square in Baghdad in 2007 which left 14 unarmed civilians dead and at least 17 wounded. In 2015 the US courts convicted Nicholas Slatten of first-degree murder, while Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were convicted of voluntary and attempted manslaughter.
> 
> US President Donald Trump pardoned the four contractors on 22 December.
> 
> “Pardoning the Blackwater contractors is an affront to justice and to the victims of the Nisour Square massacre and their families,” said Jelena Aparac, Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on the use of mercenaries.
> 
> “The Geneva Conventions oblige States to hold war criminals accountable for their crimes, even when they act as private security contractors. These pardons violate US obligations under international law and more broadly undermine humanitarian law and human rights at a global level.
> 
> “Ensuring accountability for such crimes is fundamental to humanity and to the community of nations,” she said. “Pardons, amnesties, or any other forms of exculpation for war crimes open doors to future abuses when States contract private military and security companies for inherent state functions.”
>

The problem, of course, is that Mitch McConnell has absolutely no interest in this at all. Earlier today, Mitch McConnell blocked the motion to vote on increasing the checks to $2,000.

,"Interesting enough, I was just studying this in my sustainable class. Since it was one of the last classes for my masters degree, I was actually shocked to see a group do a whole project on how seaweed and kelp is great for the environment.

So when there is excess carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, not only does it interact with the ozone (O3) but also the oceans (H2O). Which produces carbonic acid (H2CO3). This, further acidifying the oceans which throws off the pH for a multitude of species and habitats. 

Interesting enough, kelp is easy to grow and grows fast (like 0.5 meter per day if I remember correctly). Kelp requires carbon dioxide just like many other plants do to leverage photosynthesis and those processes. 

Then once the kelp dies or is disconnected from the sea floor or seaweed farm, the gas sacks cause it to float further out into the ocean (despite feeling like you see a lot of kelp on shore, most goes the other direction due to currents) and then once out in the ocean, sinks. Depending on the depth of the area it sinks, the carbon dioxide captured can be sequestered for anywhere from 10-1000s of years. 

Additionally, seaweed and kelp is close (though not as cheap as land grains per lb) to the feed costs for land animals, especially cows who output massive amounts of methane into the atmosphere due to their diet (cow farts, eww I know). The amazing thing is we could leverage sea area for food resource for our food sources instead of land area, especially considering how much more area the oceans take up. And, the added benefit of it reduces the food industries overall carbon and methane input to the atmosphere. 

Though it will probably have to be scaled and leveraged for better $/lb. with a steep learning curve before this will be a realistic solution.

Good, the executive order shouldn't be bypassing the constitution, it shouldn't be a replacement for laws.  We don't have a king to issue his will.
 
> But, he said, he would not seek to use executive action to mandate policy changes that he has long said are up to Congress to make.

> Biden cited gun control as an example, saying that if he signed an executive order banning assault weapons, a future Republican president could undo that ban and use it as a precedent to drastically expand gun rights.
 
This is a hot button issue which was used as an example which is likely going to end up with knee jerk responses using it in a literal sense rather than an analogy as it seemed to be intended.  
 
So intentionally ignoring firearms to focus on the underlying point, I interpret this as; ""Jerking the nations heading back and forth every 4 years is internally damaging, we need changes to be made in law, not based on the will of the president for this term"".  

From that interpretation, I'm in agreement with that.     
 
In my opinion only; The use of executive orders is important when used well.  But shouldn't be seen as a replacement for passing laws, especially on important issues.  Though of course the equally absurd executive orders from this presidency being rescinded absolutely makes sense as well.
 
...
 
The greater discussion seems to be down-article regarding Tom Vilsack, since [his involvement with the firing of Shirley Sherrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firing_of_Shirley_Sherrod) was an issue.  On one hand, I agree.  And certainly everyone involved has said that was a mistake, from Vilsack himself to Obama.  [The NAACP itself was fooled and made statements against Sherrod](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/naacp-retracts-shirley-sherrod-statement-says-it-was-snookered-by-fox-news-andrew-breitbart/) 
 (and later retracted their statements), so Vilsack was far from alone in this regard.
 
So while I can certainly agree his mistake is relevant, I can't agree it is disqualifying any more than it means the NAACP should be disqualified as a relevant organization.  It was a mistake, one that [Vilsack has spoken on and apologized for.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vilsack-i-will-have-to-live-with-shirley-sherrod-mistake/);
 
> Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters this afternoon that he has offered a ""personal and profound"" apology to Shirley Sherrod for forcing her to resign as a result of an out-of-context video posted to a conservative website.

> ""I asked for Shirley's forgiveness, and she was gracious enough to extend it to me,"" Vilsack said, accepting ""full responsibility"" for forcing her to step down.

> ""This is a good woman,"" he said. ""She has been put through hell. I could have done and should have done a better job.""
 
Recognizing the mistake matters here, and efforts were taken where possible.  I'd argue in the edited misinformation efforts of groups like this gained sophistication faster than most adapted to them.  [Take for example anti-abortion groups manipulating video to attack planned parenthood.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_2015_undercover_videos_controversy)  Enough people believed that for it to result in multiple [political impacts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_2015_undercover_videos_controversy#Political_impact)
 
And as a half-joking-half-not aside... it's not like us on the internet would ever get tricked by a carefully crafted message or headline right?  
 
So anyway, while it's not irrelevant, it's also (to me at least in a personal view) not a deal breaker to believe a person is qualified in so far as they've recognized the mistake and worked to be better.
 
...
 
And the final part of the article is focused on his concerns about public views of ""Defund the Police.""
 
> ""I also don't think we should get too far ahead ourselves on dealing with police reform in that, because they've already labeled us as being 'defund the police' anything we put forward in terms of the organizational structure to change policing -- which I promise you, will occur. Promise you,"" Biden said.
 
> ""That's how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we're talking about defunding the police. We're not. We're talking about holding them accountable. We're talking about giving them money to do the right things. We're talking about putting more psychologists and psychiatrists on the telephones when the 911 calls through. We're talking about spending money to enable them to do their jobs better, not with more force, with less force and more understanding.""
 
On one hand, absolutely can understand the concern that he's showing hesitation to go 'all out' on this.  Especially after a presidency which seemingly would have little concern about the political oppositions opinions as he seems to be having about his political oppositions opinions.  That said, realistically in a functioning government, we need that.
 
More to the point though, what he's focused on I'm not disagreeing with personally.  The idea (at least in my own views, this is opinion) is not removal of the police as an organization.  It's having them not be the only stop for any issues.  Not calling the police as a default and expecting these men and women to be everything from soldiers to psychiatrists.  
 
""Defund"" in the sense of ""Remove those parts of their jobs and re-allocate that funding to other groups who can do specific duties.""  Not ""Defund"" in the sense of ""The police no longer exist"".  And he's right that the messaging on that is mixed, especially in groups that are (rightly or not) the most angry with the police.

The State Attorney General is the chief legal advisor for the state. Basically the head of a giant law firm that is supposed to act on behalf of the state. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State\_attorney\_general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general)

Recognizing that law firms are supposed to act in the best interests of their clients, I'm wondering who is the client here? Their respective states or the Republican Party? 

Is it in the best interest of these states for their attorneys general to join their legal reputations to a suit headed by a state's head legal council who is himself in trouble with the law?",moinatx,,ka5kwo,gf8wq8h

* There's some *gems*. See below excerpt:

>10 . The probability of former Vice President Biden winning the popular vote in the four Defendant States—Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—independently given President Trump’s early lead in those States as of 3 a.m. on November 4,
2020, is less than one in a quadrillion, or 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000. For former Vice President Biden to win these four States collectively, the odds of that event happening decrease to less than one in a quadrillion to the fourth power (i.e., 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000^4 ). See Decl. of Charles J.
Cicchetti, Ph.D. (“Cicchetti Decl.”) at ¶¶ 14-21, 30-31.
See App. 4a-7a, 9a.

>11 . The same less than one in a quadrillion statistical improbability of Mr. Biden winning the popular vote in the four Defendant States—Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin— independently exists when Mr. Biden’s performance in each of those Defendant States is compared to former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton’s performance in the 2016 general election and
President Trump’s performance in the 2016 and 2020 general elections. Again, the statistical improbability of Mr. Biden winning the popular vote in these four States collectively is 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000^5 . Id. 10-13, 17-21, 30-31.

For comparison, [the odds of being dealt a royal flush are 649,739 : 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability). Imagine being dealt this hand 13* times in a row.

[PolitiFact wrote this analysis](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/10/facebook-posts/texas-lawsuit-statistics-fraud-wisconsin-michigan/) breaking down the math of how Cicchetti came to this probability. In short, he not only assumed that any and every vote should be calculated as a coin flip with even odds, but ignored or dismissed the reality in Georgia that the remaining votes that flipped the states were absentee ballots that skew Democrat.

>**How Has Funding for the Internal Revenue Service Changed Over Time?**

>Appropriations for the IRS have fallen by a total of about 20 percent in real (inflation-adjusted) dollars between 2010 and 2018. With the exception of 2016, real appropriations have consistently fallen below the previous year’s level over that period. Because labor costs account for about 70 percent of the IRS’s budget, measures to reduce its workforce were instituted, including a hiring freeze. Those measures resulted in a 22 percent decline in the number of employees at the agency and a 30 percent decline in the number of employees working in enforcement roles.1 The number of revenue agents and revenue officers, highly specialized enforcement employees who handle the most complex examinations and collections cases, fell by 35 percent and 48 percent, respectively, between 2010 and 2018.

>**How Have Reductions in Funding and Staffing Affected Enforcement?**

>As the IRS’s budget and workforce declined, so did its examination rates for both individual and corporate income tax returns. (The examination rate is the number of examinations closed in a fiscal year divided by the number of returns filed in the previous calendar year.) The overall examination rate for all returns fell by about 40 percent between 2010 and 2018. Over that period:

>•The examination rate for individual income tax returns dropped by about 46 percent. About 0.6 percent of individual income tax returns were examined in 2018.

>•The examination rate for corporate income tax returns fell by about 37 percent. In 2018, 0.9 percent of corporate income tax returns were examined.

>•Larger corporations were more likely to have their returns examined than smaller ones over the 2010–2018 period. However, the examination rates for large corporations—those with assets of more than $10 million—declined more steeply between 2010 and 2018 than examination rates for corporations with fewer assets did.

>•Similarly, higher-income individuals were more likely to be examined than lower-income ones over the period. However, the examination rate for higher-income taxpayers fell, while the examination rate for lower-income taxpayers remained fairly stable. Nearly all examinations of lower-income taxpayers were initiated because of claims for the earned income tax credit.

>•The amount of additional taxes and penalties the IRS recommended after examinations of corporate and individual income tax returns—before taxpayers appeal or challenge those recommendations—also fell from 2010 to 2018. The decline occurred because the IRS closed fewer examinations each year.

>The amount of delinquent tax debt, or unpaid assessments, increased from 2010 to 2018. The amount of revenue received from that debt as a result of collections activities, however, remained between 8 percent and 10 percent of unpaid assessments over the period. The number of delinquent taxpayer accounts, resulting from returns filed without payment of all taxes due or examination assessments not paid promptly, generally increased from 2010 to 2018. The IRS is also responsible for securing returns that were not filed on time. The number of investigations of delinquent filers fell over the 2010–2018 period.

But oddly enough, it does draw one as well.

So it notes that Indians are people, but shouldn’t be counted. And if we’re examining this from an originalist perspective, we would look to the intent of the Congress who passed the Civil War Amendments, to examine what that distinction meant to them.

"" The Constitution does not specifically define which persons must be  included in the apportionment base.  Although the Constitution requires  the “persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,” to be  enumerated in the census, that requirement has never been understood to  include in the apportionment base every individual physically present  within a State’s boundaries at the time of the census.  Instead, the  term “persons in each State” has been interpreted to mean that only the  “inhabitants” of each State should be included.  Determining which  persons should be considered “inhabitants” for the purpose of  apportionment requires the exercise of judgment.  For example, aliens  who are only temporarily in the United States, such as for business or  tourism, and certain foreign diplomatic personnel are “persons” who have  been excluded from the apportionment base in past censuses.   Conversely, the Constitution also has never been understood to exclude  every person who is not physically “in” a State at the time of the  census.  For example, overseas Federal personnel have, at various times,  been included in and excluded from the populations of the States in  which they maintained their homes of record.  The discretion delegated  to the executive branch to determine who qualifies as an “inhabitant”  includes authority to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are  not in a lawful immigration status.

> Signed March 24, 1992, the Open Skies Treaty permits each state-party to conduct short-notice, unarmed, reconnaissance flights over the others' entire territories to collect data on military forces and activities. Observation aircraft used to fly the missions must be equipped with sensors that enable the observing party to identify significant military equipment, such as artillery, fighter aircraft, and armored combat vehicles. Though satellites can provide the same, and even more detailed, information, not all of the treaty states-parties have such capabilities.  The treaty is also aimed at building confidence and familiarity among states-parties through their participation in the overflights.

> President Dwight Eisenhower first proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union allow aerial reconnaissance flights over each other's territory in July 1955. Claiming the initiative would be used for extensive spying, Moscow rejected Eisenhower's proposal. President George H.W. Bush revived the idea in May 1989 and negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact started in February 1990.

> In a criminal-justice system characterized by its inhumanity, the pardon power is capable of only one thing, something more spiritual than legal: mercy. Part of clemency’s elegance is the dialectic between the giver of mercy and the recipient, in which responsibility for a crime is accepted and contrition expressed, followed by mercy and reconciliation. Trump has upended this by taking the acceptance of responsibility and the reconciliation out of it; too often, clemency in his hands has just been a way to mark and reward terrible behavior he approves of, as with Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s biased policing.

Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, pp. 84-85 (8th Ed. 2017). 
> 
> **Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications, and in accord with the best tradition of the John C. Keeney Award for Exceptional Integrity and Professionalism (my most cherished Departmental recognition), I must regretfully resign from my role as Director of the Electoral Crimes Branch**.

&nbsp;

Pilger is not alone in his criticism of Barr,

>Barr's memo on Monday drew swift backlash from election-law experts and DOJ veterans who defended Pilger's reputation and excoriated the attorney general's decision as politically motivated.

>""Given the kinds of unsupported claims Barr has made about election fraud before, I am concerned about his potential meddling in the electoral process for political reasons,"" Rick Hasen, an election law and administration expert at the University of California at Irvine, told Business Insider.

>""Richard Pilger is a respected apolitical attorney who has been a federal corruption prosecutor for decades,"" Noah Bookbinder, a former DOJ corruption-crimes prosecutor who is the director of the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, tweeted Monday, adding: ""His resigning in protest makes clear to me that something very wrong indeed is happening here.""

...

> Nonetheless, Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, told The New York Times that Barr's decision to reverse DOJ policies on election noninterference ""**when there is no such evidence — and when the president's clear strategy is to delegitimize the results of a proper election — is one of the more problematic acts of any attorney general in my lifetime**.""

...

> As Business Insider has reported, **there is no evidence of widespread voter or election fraud, and this election was among the safest and most secure because of the use of paper ballots and voting machines with verifiable paper trails**.",SFepicure,,jrm07o,gbu54dq
,"While I think this is silly and frivolous, I don't have a problem with the government investigating election fraud.

I'd rather we waste time and money so that A) we are sure any fraud is caught and B) people are less likely to try to commit fraud because they know it will be investigated.

I do, however, think it is inappropriate for him to pretend that there are ""clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State."" That coupled with Trump's comments raise serious concern, but I think he should be called out on his *language*, not an investigation.",dupelize,,jrm07o,gbupdd8

Besides FDR, the only other American presidential candidate who ran against an incumbent president and got more than 52 percent of the vote was William Henry Harrison in 1840.

,"The headline is false. The electorate votes in the president and not the AP. I say this because of all the legal challenges from President Trump. What is left until the election is finalized:

Nov. 3, 2020: Election Day, when voters in each state will select their presidential electors. The names of electors are not on the ballot in most states. Rather, when a voter casts a vote for a presidential candidate, s/he is also casting a vote for the electors already selected by the party of that candidate. If a majority of voters in a state vote for the Republican candidate for president, the Republican slate of electors is elected. If a majority vote for the Democratic candidate, the Democratic slate of electors is chosen.

Dec. 8, 2020: Deadline for Resolving Election Disputes. All state recounts and court contests over presidential election results must be completed by this date. (3 U.S.C. § 5). For the majority of states the date of certification is the same as for all contests, but in eight states there is a deadline that either directly references 3 USC §5 or uses similar language, requiring that disputes surrounding the selection of presidential electors be resolved in time to meet the “safe harbor” deadline: Indiana, Iowa, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. For detailed information on state post-election processes, please visit this page.

Dec. 14, 2020: Meeting of the Electors. The electors meet in each state and cast their ballots for president and vice president. Each elector votes on his or her own ballot and signs it. The ballots are immediately transmitted to various people: one copy goes to the president of the U.S. Senate (who is also the vice president of the United States); this is the copy that will be officially counted later. Other copies go to the state's secretary of state, the National Archives and Records Administration, and the presiding judge in the district where the electors meet (this serves as a backup copy that would replace the official copy sent to the president of the Senate if it is lost or destroyed).

Dec. 23, 2020: Deadline for Receipt of Ballots. The electors' ballots from all states must be received by the president of the Senate by this date. There is no penalty for missing this deadline.

Jan. 6, 2021: Counting of the Electoral Ballots. The U.S. Congress meets in joint session to count the electoral votes.

>Inside the bank, compliance officers had been looking at some of the transactions that were going in and out of Donald Trump's bank accounts, and Jared Kushner's bank accounts, too. Kushner was also a big client of Deutsche Bank. And what they were seeing was that money, in some cases, was flowing to international sources, in some cases wealthy Russians — that raised a lot of concerns from a money-laundering perspective. So compliance officers within the bank essentially blew the whistle and said: These transactions are troubling. We need to report them as suspicious to the federal government. And these concerns were kind of elevated up the flagpole within Deutsche Bank, and managers and executives at a higher-level ultimately decided that, no, these concerns did not need to be escalated to the government or even reported to the government. But within the bank, there was a big concern that something weird was going on in the Trump bank accounts.

> To widespread alarm, and at least one protest that Trump would not be able to pay his lease obligations, Deutsche Bank’s private wealth group loaned the Trump Organization an additional $175 million to renovate the Old Post Office Building in Washington and turn it into a luxury hotel.

>Like Trump, Deutsche Bank has been scrutinized for its dealings in Russia. The bank paid more than $600 million to regulators in 2017 and agreed to a consent order that cited “serious compliance deficiencies” that “spanned Deutsche Bank’s global empire.” The case focused on “mirror trades,” which Deutsche Bank facilitated between 2011 and 2015. The trades were sham transactions whose sole purpose appeared to be to illicitly convert rubles into pounds and dollars — some $10 billion worth.

>A spokesperson said Deutsche Bank has increased its anti-financial-crime staff in recent years and is “committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.” The bank said it has policies in place to address the potential for conflicts of interest, including “special measures with respect to clients that hold public office or perform public functions in the U.S.”

>The bank was “laundering money for wealthy Russians and people connected to Putin and the Kremlin in a variety of ways for almost the exact time period that they were doing business with Donald Trump,” Enrich said. “And all of that money through Deutsche Bank was being channeled through the same exact legal entity in the U.S. that was handling the Donald Trump relationship in the U.S. And so there are a lot of coincidences here.”",Dim_Innuendo,,jn93lm,gb07zwc

,">Both have dug into the crosstabs of Trafalgar polls and pointed to questionable breakdowns as evidence Trafalgar doesn’t know what it’s doing. For instance, the crosstabs in a Michigan poll, which are no longer online, appeared to show Trump leading Biden by 8 points among young voters, a Democratic stronghold.

According to a Harvard Youth Poll, as of late September-Early October [Biden is leading Trump 63%-25% among likely voters age 18-29](https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/harvard-youth-poll). 

In 2016, [age 18-29 voters in Michigan swung for Clinton 57% to Trump's 34%](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/mi/).

The idea that in the last four years the youth vote has swung that far towards Trump is laughable, and finding that in a poll would be a good reason to step back and examine what may be wrong with the polling methods.

There may be the possibility of ""shy Trump voters"" but I'm much more confident in 538's assertion that while there may be some undercounting, but [the evidence does not support the ""shy"" Trump voter theory](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-arent-shy-but-polls-could-still-be-missing-some-of-them/).  For example, if this phenomenon was real you would probably expect higher support when polls are taken anonymously online vs by telephone (where ""shyness"" would be more likely).  There was no statistically significant difference.

The American Association for Public Opinion Research [did not support the ""shy"" Trump theory](https://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Reports/An-Evaluation-of-2016-Election-Polls-in-the-U-S.aspx) and in fact found that the national polls were among the most accurate in estimating the popular vote since 1936.  Per that report:

>Some Trump voters who participated in pre-election polls did not reveal themselves as Trump voters until after the election, and they outnumbered late-revealing Clinton voters. This finding could be attributable to either late deciding or misreporting (the so-called Shy Trump effect) in the pre-election polls. **A number of other tests for the Shy Trump theory yielded no evidence to support it.** [emphasis mine]

One of the most compelling reasons they provide for why polls under-estimated support for Trump is that about 13% of voters in WI/FL/PA decided on their choice in the final week, and broke for Trump by almost 30 points in WI and 17 points in FL/PA.  

[The number of undecided voters in 2020 is significantly less than in 2016](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/18/donald-trumps-toughest-hurdle-2020-election-win-few-undecideds/3654305001/).

,"Something I've seen on conservative subreddits when this topic comes up: bragging about giving misleading answers to polls on purpose: ""whenever pollsters call me I tell them I'm surefire voting Biden but on election day I can't wait to pull the lever for Trump."" This is a common claim.

Do debates about ""Shy Trump Voters"" include any accounting for a possible cultural bias--perhaps a widespread one among Trump voters--to *mislead* polls as an explicit strategy? Is there any research on whether a culture of foiling poll questions could create a large systematic polling error?

I'm reminded of internet savvy Ron Paul voters, who realized they could rush online and flood naïve network ""polls"" and [GOP formal straw polls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/why-ron-paulkeeps-winning-straw-polls/2011/06/20/AGu2qvcH_blog.html) to make it look like Paul won every debate. It took a while for the networks to catch on that Paul backers were using a conscious strategy to drive the narrative, where a small percentage of motivated supporters could change the outcome.

If only 5% of Trump voters have decided to engage in this strategy (and Biden voters have no equivalent pool of ""Poll Trolls""), and if they're savvy enough to dodge any confounding rebalancing questions (""why yes, I DO have a college degree... Sure I wear a mask every time I go out""), and if they're being polled at proportional rates, it seems like they could seriously skew the results.

If there was ever a demographic that I imagined could include 5% (or more) of savvy trolls who would delight in breaking polls as an election strategy, it would be Trump voters.

And again, on conservative subreddits, they explicitly brag about doing this. It's not a secret. (I would prove this with links, but crosslinking to other reddit discussions is not allowed, so I have removed the offending links. If a reader is interested, just go look at polling discussions in conservative subreddits).

And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.

They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks.

,"Roberta Kaplan impressive once again - all the analysis I had read has suggested it was a tough ask to convince a judge here. 

It seemed like the administration had waived their right to insert themselves into this case given Trump had fought this (personally) in Court for a year, and it was only when he looked like he was about to lose did the Justice department seek to insert. But that waiver [wasn't the core of Kaplan's argument](http://openargs.com/wp-content/uploads/EJC-Opp.pdf). It's only mentioned on page 8: 
>  It does not appear that the White House directed the Justice Department to intercede in response to any new facts in this case, which had been pending for over ten months in state court without any suggestion that it was somehow a case against the United States. Rather, the Justice Department intervened to shield Trump from legal accountability only after his state court stall tactics, procedural gambits, and assertions of immunity were all rejected.

Instead they took on the fundamentals which was brave, but seems to have paid off. 

An interesting wrinkle:
> The Justice Department relied solely on written arguments in the dispute after its lawyer was banned from a Manhattan federal courthouse last week because he had not quarantined for two weeks after traveling to New York from a state on a list of those whose coronavirus test rates were high.

The justice department lawyer came from DC to NY, and was not allowed in the courtroom because NY had required people from certain states, including Virginia, to quarantine. The lawyer submitted the request for a continuance *on the day of the hearing*, even though the ban had been in place for a week, ([source](https://www.courthousenews.com/virus-protocols-scuttle-e-jean-carroll-arguments-against-trump/)). It's crazy to me that the Justice Department couldn't get a lawyer to come from NYC or somewhere else to argue the case with a weeks notice. Suggests they either were pretty disorganised, or weren't really trying to make an argument, but just wanted to drag it out. They were given the option to argue by phone, and decided not to, which I take as an indication they really didn't want to make a case, just slow things down:

Aren't those enough? Why enforce an additional requirement that users can't post specific articles from qualified sources because the headline is editorialized? If we allow (say) WAPO, and they posts an article with an editorialised headline, why prevent users from posting it? Users can't control the headline, and we don't want them to change the title.

I suppose the edge case is opinion pieces, or editorials, which might be very editorialised or inflammatory (Tom Cotton in the NYT for example). So perhaps a carve out for opinion pieces, but frankly I'd simplify and just say -

Perhaps create a meta-level sticky thread for discussing mod activity so that you get open feedback regarding any heavyhandedness or lack of moderation. Or perhaps this post is that thread.

On the other hand, a discussion of source quality for comments should be allowable since it’s germane to the discussion, unless it’s a roundabout meta-level discussion of the rules related to sources.

Unfortunately, whataboutism is contextual, which means the same examples in different cases would be whataboutism in one and not in the other. For example: If one were showing a historical comparison as ""those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it"" that would *not* be whataboutism. However, if one were showing the same historical comparison to change the topic, that would be whataboutism. 

Example of Whataboutism: 70 of immigrant detainees in the US detains are held in private facilities [1] but so did the Nazis who did it worse by detaining people without judicial review [2] so stop worrying about US detention centers.  

Example of Not Whataboutism: Before the ""concentration camp system"" was formalized the Nazis were  ""detaining"" people in informal, privately-owned ""protective detention"" (Schutzhaft) centers [2][3]. After Hitler changed the judicial system to pack the courts based on loyalty to Naziism [2][3], then the Nazis expanded dramatically into detaining political/social/religious/racial ""undesirables"" and expanded that into what became known as the concentration camp/dealth-camp system.

,"> Can you come up with clear examples of claims that are and aren't whataboutism? Is there a universally accepted definition that doesn't rely on the ""I'll know it when I see it"" principle?

Kinda, and probably not.

Take a hypothetical exchange: ""Trump locked kids in cages!"" ""Yeah, well what about Benghazi?""

If the goal is to have a measured policy discussion on US immigration policy, that's an easy call: definitely whataboutism, definitely not advancing the conversation. But if it's part of a broader conversation about political scandals and the amount of attention we give them, it might be okay to bring that up.

So not only is there a sorites paradox angle and a motivated reasoning angle, but there's also a ""Schroedinger's argument"" angle, where it both is and isn't an example, depending on context.

,"From the linked study
> * **Far-right terrorism** refers to the use or threat of violence by subnational or non-state entities whose goals may include
 * racial or ethnic supremacy;
 * opposition to government authority;
 * anger at women, including from the involuntary celibate (or “incel”) movement;
 * belief in certain conspiracy theories, such as QAnon;
 * and outrage against certain policies, such as abortion.
 * Some extremists on the violent far-right have supported “accelerationism,” which includes taking actions to promote social upheaval and incite a civil war.
* **Far-left terrorism** involves the use or threat of violence by subnational or non-state entities that oppose 
 * capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism;
 * advocate black nationalism;
 * pursue environmental or animal rights issues;
 * espouse pro-communist or pro-socialist beliefs;
 * or support a decentralized social and political system such as anarchism.
* **Other** involves the use or threat of violence by subnational or non-state entities that do not neatly fit into any of the above categories, such as the anti-government Boogaloo movement, whose adherents aim to start a civil war (or “boogaloo”) in the United States.

I do not think these groupings are as good as they could be. The split between what is ""opposition to government authority"" and what is ""support a decentralized social and political system such as anarchism"" seems ripe for categorization bias for example.   

Further, it seems misleading to use the categorical headers of ""right"" and ""left"" as under this categorization the [2017 Congressional baseball shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Congressional_baseball_shooting) where an [anti-Trump Bernie Sanders supporter](https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/14/homepage2/james-hodgkinson-profile/index.html) shot a number of republicans would, under this categorization system, most likely be categorized as ""Far-Right Terrorism"" due to the primary motivation being opposed to the government authority.

You just come in here with that negative attitude.” He also was plenty miffed when she said that he used to have bigger rallies.

They went on to do a [followup study](https://cdd.stanford.edu/2019/america-in-one-room/),

> America in One Room—Election Follow-Up

> The participants in the Deliberative Poll in Dallas and the control group were surveyed in a recent follow-up conducted by NORC. 463 of the original deliberators and 710 of the original control group responded. They were asked about how much they followed the campaign, what they thought of the government’s handling of the Covid crisis and who they planned to vote for. Results for both the deliberators and the control group are presented here.

&nbsp;


[*America in One Room—Election Follow-Up - Summary*](https://cdd.stanford.edu/mm/2020/10/a1r-followup-summary.pdf)

> The America in One Room deliberations took place in Dallas more than a year ago, September 19-22, 2019. The deliberations were sponsored by Helena and organized by the Center for Deliberative Democracy (CDD) at Stanford University, NORC at the University of Chicago and By the People Productions.

> What do the deliberators from America in One Room think about the 2020 presidential election?

> To explore this issue the CDD conducted a short follow-up survey with the weekend deliberators and the control group from 2019. This new fieldwork took place September 25 to October 5, 2020. NORC at the University of Chicago conducted the follow-up and succeeded in getting responses from463 out of the original 523 deliberators and 710 out of the original 844members of the control group. 

> The tables presented here compare the follow-up deliberators and control groups. They suggest that the **deliberators paid significantly more attention to the campaign (p.2). They rated the government’s response to the COVID19 pandemic significantly worse than did the control group(p. 3). They rated the government’s response to the public health effects of the COVID19 significantly worse than did the control group (p.7). And they rated the government’s response to the economic effects of the COVID19 pandemic significantly worse than did the control group** (p.5).

> We also asked their voting intention in the election. **Among the deliberators 59.5% say they would vote for Biden if the election were held today. 31.3% say they would support Trump. In the control group the gap between the candidates is far smaller. 44.6% in the control group say they would vote for Biden while 40.8% say they would vote for Trump** (see page 9). Breakdowns of the voting intention by party are shown on page 10. 

> The follow-up sample matches up well with the original sample both for the deliberators and the control group. The party ID percentages for Republicans, Democrats and Independents for both the original treatment and control samples and the follow-up samples are presented on page 12.

> Bruce Golding, a reporter at the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid since 2007, did not allow his byline to be used because he had concerns over the article’s credibility, the two Post employees said, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

...

> As deadline approached, editors pressed staff members to add their bylines to the story — and at least one aside from Mr. Golding refused, two Post journalists said. A Post spokeswoman had no comment on how the article was written or edited.

> Headlined “BIDEN SECRET E-MAILS,” the article appeared Wednesday with two bylines: Emma-Jo Morris, a deputy politics editor who joined the paper after four years at the Murdoch-owned Fox News, and Gabrielle Fonrouge, a Post reporter since 2014.

> Ms. Morris did not have a bylined article in The Post before Wednesday, a search of its website showed. She arrived at the tabloid in April after working as an associate producer on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, according to her LinkedIn profile. Her Instagram account, which was set to private on Wednesday, included photos of her posing with the former Trump administration members Mr. Bannon and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, as well as Roger J. Stone Jr., a friend and former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump. (In July, the president commuted the sentence of Mr. Stone on seven felonies.)

> Ms. Fonrouge had little to do with the reporting or writing of the article, said three people with knowledge of how it was prepared. She learned that her byline was on the story only after it was published, the people said.
