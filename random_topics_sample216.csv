How Local Covid Deaths Are Affecting Vote Choice,155,hzevob,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/upshot/polling-trump-virus-election.html,56,1595972596.0,,"to understand whether these community-level experiences are affecting people’s views of the president and his party, we need local-level data on both covid-19 deaths and people’s views of mr. trump and his fellow republicans over time — as the death tolls change place to place. this is a challenge; a typical poll of 1,000 people cannot deliver sufficiently granular data. there are more than 3,000 counties in the country, and the death tolls are changing in each of them in different ways every week.

the democracy fund + u.c.l.a. nationscape project has been interviewing 6,250 people a week since july 2019. to date, there are more than 300,000 completed interviews spanning every state in the country and most counties. the survey is conducted online and is fielded by the market research firm lucid.

the data contain more cases in big places like los angeles county than in small ones, like grafton county, n.h., but there are enough people in counties with varying rates of covid-19 deaths over time to investigate whether a relationship exists.

for our analyses, people in the survey are assigned their county’s per-capita 60-day cumulative number of covid-19 deaths. the 60-day period is that just preceding the date each person was interviewed. in this way, we capture variation in county-level deaths within counties because people in the same county are interviewed on different days.

similarly, because people have been interviewed all over the country on the same dates, we also have captured variation across counties at the same moment. some counties had high covid-19 death rates in april, while others did not. as we moved into may and june, a different set of counties experienced rising rates. the goal is to figure out whether the differences in covid-19 deaths per capita in a county at a given point in time are affecting how people plan to vote in 2020 and how they rate the president. (we also try to account for possible confounding factors that might also be changing broadly at the same time: see more on the methodology at bottom.)

the analyses reveal clear patterns across multiple levels of geography (states and counties) and different offices (president, senate and house). local coronavirus fatalities are hurting republicans running for federal offices."
Hannity Says It’s ‘Despicable’ to Call for Political Opponents to Be ‘Locked Up’,479,bxtj3y,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hannity-says-its-despicable-to-call-for-political-opponents-to-be-locked-up,106,1559936005.0,,"apparently, “lock her up!” never happened.

reacting to reports that house speaker nancy pelosi said she doesn’t want to see president trump impeached because she would rather “see him in prison,” fox news host sean hannity lashed out at the democratic leader thursday night.

during his show-opening monologue, the pro-trump cable news star took aim at congressional democrats over their desire to impeach the president, claiming they are getting assistance from “the psychotic media mob conspiracy theorist liars.”

adding that the democratic party is the “party of anti-trump rage and psychosis,” he moved on to pelosi’s recent comments that impeachment “is not enough.”

“speaker nancy pelosi telling senior democrats she would like to see trump behind bars,” hannity exclaimed. “based on no actual crimes, she wants a political opponent locked up in prison. umm, that happens in banana republics. beyond despicable behavior.”

pelosi's statement, he said, was proof democrats want to turn the united states into a country that we “no longer recognize.”

calls for the jailing of political opponents is something hannity should recognize very well, however. trump’s campaign rallies have long been marked by chants of “lock her up” directed at former democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton.

besides encouraging calls for clinton to be jailed, trump has also accused democratic lawmakers of “treason” over their border security policies and repeatedly leveled that charge against fbi officials over the russia investigation.

hannity, meanwhile, has largely led the charge in calling for clinton to be investigated and face potential prison time. two-and-a-half years after the 2016 election, the fox host was still claiming the former secretary of state’s “email server is a real threat to our safety and security.”"

sen. dick durbin suggested tuesday that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell wasn’t putting election security legislation up for a vote because republicans benefited from russian interference in the 2016 election.

the democratic whip’s remarks come after mcconnell declared in a floor speech tuesday “case closed” on special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election.

“there are two possibilities,” durbin said. “he really doesn’t believe it, he doesn’t think the russians were involved in 2016. he ignores the mueller report and our intelligence agencies or in the alternative feels the russians were on the side of the republicans in 2016 and just might be again in 2020.”

durbin added that he hopes that “that latter possibility is so remote as to being impossible.”

mcconnell fired back at democratic criticism in his floor speech tuesday morning, blasting democrats for mocking sen. john mccain (r-ariz.) and then-former governor mitt romney for warning about the danger of russian president vladimir putin.

“maybe stronger leadership would have left the kremlin less emboldened. maybe tampering with our democracy wouldn’t have seemed so very tempting,” he said.

mcconnell also added that congress has taken action on election security by appropriating millions of dollars to states to improve their election systems.

donald trump jr., the president's eldest son and outspoken defender, fanned the flames of a racist conspiracy by sharing a tweet falsely claiming that sen. kamala harris isn't a black american.

the tweet that trump jr. promoted suggested that harris, who was born in oakland, california to an indian immigrant mother and a black jamaican immigrant father, isn't black enough to be an authority on issues of race.

""kamala harris is implying she is descended from american black slaves,"" ali alexander, a fringe alt-right activist, tweeted. ""she's not. she comes from jamaican slave owners. that's fine. she's not an american black. period.""

trump jr. shared alexander's tweet with his 3.6 million followers during thursday's democratic 2020 primary debate, writing, ""is this true? wow.""

during thursday's debate, harris took a few minutes to discuss issues of race, challenging former vice president joe biden on his record of opposing school desegregation through busing, and his recent controversial remarks about his work with notorious segregationist senators.

""growing up, my sister and i had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she — because we were black,"" harris added, at one point noting that she was the ""only black person on this stage.""

alexander told the daily beast that he attacked harris because she ""stole debate time under the premise that she is an african-american when she is in fact a biracial indian-jamaican who is a first generation american.""

trump jr. later deleted his tweet. harris' campaign compared the attack to the president's years-long attempts to discredit president barack obama with his ""birther"" conspiracy.

""this is the same type of racist attacks his father used to attack barack obama. it didn't work then and it won't work now,"" campaign spokeswoman lily adams told news outlets.

a spokesman for trump jr. said he erased the message after his followers ""misconstrued"" its intent.

but, with trump jr.'s help, the message went viral in conservative circles online, fueling existing conspiracies about harris' race as part of broader right-wing attempts to discredit the candidate.

updated at 5:40 p.m. et

the u.s. supreme court has unanimously upheld laws across the country that remove or punish rogue electoral college delegates who refuse to cast their votes for the presidential candidate they were pledged to support.

the decision monday was a loss for ""faithless electors,"" who argued that under the constitution they have discretion to decide which candidate to support.

writing for the court, justice elena kagan, in a decision peppered with references to the broadway show hamilton and the tv show veep, said electoral college delegates have ""no ground for reversing"" the statewide popular vote. that, she said, ""accords with the constitution — as well as with the trust of the nation that here, we the people rule.""

the decision was a relief to election law experts as well as democratic and republican party officials, who have long supported faithless elector laws such as those upheld monday.

if the case had gone the other way, it would have been a ""nightmare scenario"" in which people unhappy with the general election results could ""go after electors and try to threaten them or cajole them or bribe them to vote in a particular way,"" said richard hasen, an election law expert at the university of california, irvine.

colorado attorney general phil weiser echoed those sentiments: ""this was one where i did not want to contemplate what the other consequence would have looked like,"" he said.

even harvard law school professor lawrence lessig, who represented the rogue electors before the supreme court, appeared only mildly disappointed at the loss. ""we took this case initially because we just thought this needed to be resolved before it created a constitutional crisis,"" he said.

thirty-two states have some sort of faithless elector law, but only 15 of those remove, penalize or simply cancel the votes of the errant electors. the 15 are michigan, colorado, utah, arizona, indiana, minnesota, montana, nebraska, nevada, washington, california, new mexico, south carolina, oklahoma and north carolina. although maine has no such law, the secretary of state has said it has determined a faithless elector can be removed.

monday's supreme court decision, however, is so strong that it would seem to allow states to remove faithless electors even without a state law. duke university school of law professor guy-uriel charles said that nonetheless, it would be prudent for states to pass laws to prevent electors from going rogue.

""states certainly would be better off by imposing some statutory basis ... for removing or sanctioning rogue electors,"" charles said, adding, ""but i don't see anything in this opinion that requires them to do so.""

monday's case began after the 2016 election when a handful of electoral college delegates pledged to democratic nominee hillary clinton in colorado and washington state voted for other individuals, such as colin powell or john kasich.

as michael baca, the faithless elector from colorado, put it in an npr interview, the idea was to ""reach across the aisle"" to republican electors in 2016 and try to find a candidate that some republican delegates would be willing to support other than donald trump.

baca was removed on the spot under colorado's faithless elector law, and the washington state delegates were fined $1,000 each. in 2019, washington's law was amended to require that faithless electors be removed as well.

on monday, the supreme court put its stamp of approval on either approach, at minimum.

kagan's opinion noted that the original electoral college system created by the framers of the constitution failed to anticipate the growth of political parties. by 1796, the first contested election after george washington's retirement, the system exploded in disarray, with two consecutive electoral college ""fiascos.""

that led to passage of the 12th amendment in 1804, ""facilitating the electoral college ... as a mechanism not for deliberation but for party line voting,"" kagan wrote.

nothing in the constitution prevents the states from ""taking away presidential electors' voting discretion,"" she said. for centuries, almost all electors have considered themselves bound to vote for the winner of the state popular vote. if the framers of the constitution had a different idea, she said, they never committed it to the printed page.

justice clarence thomas, joined in part by justice neil gorsuch, agreed with the outcome but wrote separately to explain his different reasoning.

rather than interpret the constitution's sparse language about the electoral college as authorizing states to impose conditions on electors, thomas argued that power is reserved to the states by the 10th amendment.

although many americans think that they elect the president and vice president, in fact, it is the electoral college, an arcane intermediary mechanism dreamed up by the founders, that formally determines who wins the election.

the system has been considered a formality because usually the winner of the popular vote also wins the electoral college.

but twice in the past two decades, the unexpected took place: the winner of the popular vote did not become president; instead, the winner in the electoral college prevailed. trump, who got nearly 3 million fewer votes overall than clinton, won the state-by-state allotment of electoral college votes in 2016 and became president. and in 2000, george w. bush became president, winning five more electoral college votes than al gore, though gore won roughly half a million more popular votes.

in total, the popular vote winners have failed to win the electoral college vote on four occasions, the first two occurring during the 1800s.

but the fact that the last two occurred in just the past 20 years has provoked various suggestions for reform, including getting rid of the electoral college altogether. with the country as polarized as it is, however, that seems unlikely, as it would require a constitutional amendment, and that in turn requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of congress, and approval by three-quarters of the states.

several states have signed on to a proposal to sidestep the electoral college altogether by joining a ""national popular vote interstate compact"" to pledge their electoral college votes to whichever candidate wins the national popular vote, regardless of how the candidates perform in their state. so far, the compact has the support of 15 states and the district of columbia, making up 196 electoral votes of the 270 needed to win the white house.

that scheme, which would only go into effect once enough states have joined to tip the election, would surely be challenged in court as well.

flawed as the electoral college system may be, at the oral arguments in may, the justices expressed concern about tinkering with laws that bind the delegates to vote for the popular vote winner in their states.

justice samuel alito observed that if the popular vote is close, the possibility of ""changing just a few votes"" in the electoral college would rationally ""prompt the losing party ... to launch a massive campaign to try to influence electors, and there would be a long period of uncertainty about who the next president was going to be.""

similarly, justice brett kavanaugh alluded to what he called ""the chaos principle of judging, which suggests that if it's a close call ... we shouldn't facilitate or create chaos.""

none of those concerns surfaced explicitly in kagan's majority opinion. she instead pointed to the text of the constitution as well as more than 200 years of history and tradition to make her case.

""the constitution's text and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee — and the state voters' choice — for president,"" kagan wrote.

""... the electors' constitutional claim has neither text nor history on its side."""
Trump consults Bush torture lawyer on how to skirt law and rule by decree,294,hv6rn4,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/20/trump-john-yoo-lawyer-torture-waterboarding,69,1595364553.0,,"the trump administration has been consulting the former government lawyer who wrote the legal justification for waterboarding on how the president might try to rule by decree.

john yoo told the guardian he has been talking to white house officials about his view that a recent supreme court ruling on immigration would allow trump to issue executive orders on whether to apply existing federal laws.

“if the court really believes what it just did, then it just handed president trump a great deal of power, too,” yoo, a professor at berkeley law, said.

“the supreme court has said president obama could [choose not to] enforce immigration laws for about 2 million cases. and why can’t the trump administration do something similar with immigration – create its own … program, but it could do it in areas beyond that, like healthcare, tax policy, criminal justice, inner city policy. i talked to them a fair amount about cities, because of the disorder.”

in a fox news sunday interview, trump declared he would try to use that interpretation to try to force through decrees on healthcare, immigration and “various other plans” over the coming month. the white house consultations with yoo were first reported by the axios news website.

constitutional scholars and human rights activists have also pointed to the deployment of paramilitary federal forces against protesters in portland as a sign that trump is ready to use this broad interpretation of presidential powers as a means to suppress basic constitutional rights.

“this is how it begins,” laurence tribe, a harvard constitutional law professor, wrote on twitter. “the dictatorial hunger for power is insatiable. if ever there was a time for peaceful civil disobedience, that time is upon us.”

yoo became notorious for a legal memo he drafted in august 2002, when he was deputy assistant attorney general in the justice department’s office of legal counsel.

it stated: “necessity or self-defense may justify interrogation methods that might violate” the criminal prohibition on torture.

memos drafted by yoo were used for justifying waterboarding and other forms of torture on terrorism suspects at cia “black sites” around the world.

asked if he now regretted his memos, yoo replied: “i’m still not exactly sure about how far the cia took its interrogation methods but i think if they stayed within the outlines of the legal memos, i think they weren’t violating american law.”

in a book titled defender in chief, due to be published next week, yoo argues that trump was fighting to restore the powers of the presidency, in a way that would have been approved by the framers of the us constitution.

“they wanted each branch to have certain constitutional weapons and then they wanted them to fight. and so they wanted the president to try to expand his powers but they expected also congress to keep fighting with the president,” he said.

in a june article in the national review, he wrote that a supreme court decision that blocked trump’s attempt to repeal barack obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals programme, known as daca and established by executive order, meant trump could do the same thing to achieve his policy goals.

daca suspended deportations of undocumented migrants who arrived in the us as children. as an example of what trump might achieve in the same way, yoo suggested the president could declare a national right to carry firearms openly, in conflict with many state laws.

“he could declare that he would not enforce federal firearms laws,” yoo wrote, “and that a new ‘trump permit’ would free any holder of state and local gun-control restrictions.

“even if trump knew that his scheme lacked legal authority, he could get away with it for the length of his presidency,” he said. in a telephone interview, he added: “according to the supreme court, the president can now choose to under-enforce the law in certain areas and it can’t be undone by his successor unless that successor goes through this onerous thing called the administrative procedure act, which usually takes one to two years.”

constitutional scholars have rejected yoo’s arguments as ignoring limits on the executive powers of the president imposed by the founders, who were determined to prevent the rise of a tyrant.

tribe called yoo’s interpretation of the daca ruling “indefensible”.

he added: “i fear that this lawless administration will take full advantage of the fact that judicial wheels grind slowly and that it will be difficult to keep up with the many ways trump, aided and abetted by bill barr as attorney general and chad wolf as acting head of homeland security, can usurp congressional powers and abridge fundamental rights in the immigration space in particular but also in matters of public health and safety.”

on the deployment of federal paramilitary units against portland, yoo said he did not know enough of the facts to deem whether it was an abuse of executive power.

“it has to be really reasonably related to protecting federal buildings,” he said. “if it’s just graffiti, that’s not enough. it really depends on what the facts are.”

alka pradhan, a defence counsel in the 9/11 terrorism cases against inmates in the guantánamo bay prison camp, said: “john yoo’s so-called reasoning has always been based on ‘what can the president get away with?’ rather than ‘what is the purpose and letter of the law?’

“that is not legal reasoning, it’s inherently tyrannical and anti-democratic.”

pradhan and other defence lawyers in the pre-trial hearings at the guantánamo bay military tribunal have argued that the use of torture against their clients, made possible by yoo’s 2002 memo, invalidated much of the case against them.

“the fact that john yoo is employed and free to opine on legal matters is an example of the culture of impunity in the united states,” she said."
