Just because the information is under is command does not mean that he has the need-to-know for everything out there.

I wouldn't be surprised if the intelligence community was limiting President Trump's access to information, because they believe he may not handle it well.\n",

      "Obviously, there may also be information that's expunged from official (even classified) records; the president in theory would have the ability to do this. Whether or not this has ever been done, I can't say. So, it's plausible (though completely unrealistic) that Former President Obama had had Trump Tower under surveillance, and later purged all records of this. There is no reason to believe this occurred IMO, but it's not impossible. Trump would be unable to make these records public in this case. (obviously)\n",
      "Correct me if I'm wrong, and as an Australian I could be way off. But who is to say Obama even knew of anything if it did go on. Wouldn't it make sense that the CIA/FBI/NSA (sorry, unsure which agency does what) would investigate any candidates or at least president-elect to know what they need to hide/take care of for international relations to continue or not have a huge scandal out there?

      "Case 1: It's possible the wiretapping did occur but his team hasn't found anything damning and he's waiting to release it until they have. Only (kind of) bad for Trump if he never finds anything significant and stubbornly never releases - see #4. Obviously bad for Obama, and the Democratic Party's image by extension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 2: It's possible the wiretapping did occur, but declassifying and releasing it provides information about some funny business the Trump team pulled during the election. Pretty bad for Trump. Either he releases it and it makes him look bad or he doesn't and it makes him look bad. How bad depends on what exactly the funny business consisted of, but it's always going to be bad in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 3: It's possible he never had anything. Obviously bad for his image. People who voted for him lose - they supported either a liar or someone with a bad case of paranoia. A lot of people, from what I have seen, believe this is the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 4: It's possible he never had any intention of releasing anything he had regardless of content (read: tax returns). Bad for his image for not releasing evidence given the pressing demand for it. The silver lining for him, however, is he's still being an honest man and rightfully scolding someone for overstepping their bounds. The public might not be on his side but he's keeping his promises about calling out corruption, something he ended up dedicating a solid chunk of his platform to, and the people who voted for him for this win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 5: It's possible he has something that is entirely risk-free for him to release and he is sitting on it for whatever reason. Great for him. Supports the narrative of \"me vs media\" as media is overwhelmingly discrediting his claim. The honesty that many people are calling into question is affirmed and with it his supporter's trust.

Everything else can wait.

Want to punish evolutionists and preach the gospel in schools? Lower taxes for the Koch brothers and those paying for campaigns. \n",
