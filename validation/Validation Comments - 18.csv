So now let me write this: They just announced that high school teachers like me will be going back the end of April once LAUSD teachers are fully vaccinated/given the option to vaccinate. Considering my classroom has 0 windows, my class size is 32, and my 99 percent Hispanic student population and their families have been hit VERY been hit hard by this virus, I just want to say with respect that this plan seems reasonable to me. Teachers will get their two vaccine doses, it'll take a while to get all of us through the cycle, and then we'll be live... does that plan really deserve all this vitriol from WSJ readers?

If the latter, this group contains people who applied for DACA and were rejected, those who never applied because they knew they would be rejected, and a great many who had no interest in coming out of the shadows. Bottom line: no one knows who is in this group. The only way we should consider this is to screen/rescreen every potential candidate to determine whether they are law abiding and  have any chance of being self supporting. We should not legalize anyone we would have found unacceptable as a legal immigrant. If we do this, it leaves two very significant groups of people: Dreamers we reject and the parents of all Dreamers. They caused this mess. They are the only reason this issue exists.

According to the Mayo clinic website COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months in ""long haulers"". The virus can damage the lungs, heart and brain, which increases the risk of long-term health problems. Most people who have COVID-19 recover completely within a few weeks. But some people — even those who had mild versions of the disease — continue to experience symptoms after their initial recovery. According to a 6 months follow up study of a cohort reported in Lancet by Huang et al,  published on Jan 08, 2021, at 6 months, 76% of all patients had at least one of the listed symptoms, which range from fatigue/muscle weakness (63%), difficulty sleeping (26%), hair loss (22%), difficulty with smell and taste (11 and 9%), and trouble with mobility (7%). Based on the currently available science, I safely estimate that millions of COVID warriors in the world are long haulers.",6,9,6,5,26,,Good

The vaccination debacle is the last of a long series of the spiral of decadence that began in the late 1960's.

7,"Warp Speed was also a botch, just not as bad.  No one planned for how the vaccine would move from manufacturer to an injection in someone's arm.  Of course the states have responsibility but to not build this into an overall plan was poor planning.  In addition, the 10B we spent was  to procure vaccines for approximately 250M to 300M people across  5 companies, but effective only if all 5 were successful and in the approximate same timeframe. When Merck pulled out and others struggled, those in charge went back to Pfizer to buy more vaccine.  We had optioned 500M doses and bought 200.  However, Pfizer had already given multiple warnings that they were selling excess capacity.  When we tried to buy, it was too late. In short, the US was also fiscally conservative.  A better strategy would have been to excess buy in anticipation of problems.  We spent only 10B on vaccines but 15B+ on a wall.  Better planning would have brought vaccines quicker to the population.",8,7,2,5,22,,Good

8,"It's about time Big Pharma does something right. Public Citizen has found that the pharmaceutical industry is the biggest defrauder of the federal government under the False Claims Act of any industry, worse than big tobacco. Big Pharma blames price increases on research costs, but most pharmaceutical companies don’t fund any research; the 210 drugs that were patented by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 were all developed with NIH money, some $100 billion. Remember when Trump promised lower drug prices?  Big Pharma spent $280 million in both 2017 and 2018 lobbying Alex Azar and the dozen Pharma lobbyists Trump appointed  to HHS. While at Eli Lilly, Azar hiked the price of insulin -- developed in the 1920s -- from $21 to $255. The results are predictable: Fortune reported that drug makers raised the prices on 250 drugs in 2018; in addition, Trump’s renegotiated USMCA increased the patent rights of biologics to 12 years, insuring continued high drug prices. Capitalism?",7,3,3,5,18,,Bad
8,"I have been saying this for months. Years actually when other diseases are considered. Politicians have made pharma their whipping post for years now, decrying their profits and margins. Never mind of course that these same people seem to have little worry about the even higher margins and profits of the tech industry. Private investment enabled the vaccine success that pharma has delivered to the world. These vaccines did not come about solely by government edict. This is true in other areas of medicine too. My wife is a  5-year stage 3C ovarian cancer survivor.  A few decades ago, her odds of making 5 years would have been very slim. Today, thanks in-part to an innovative therapy called PARP inhibitors, she is still in remission nearly 60 months after diagnosis. The next time someone berates 'big pharma', I'll remind them again of the lives they continue to save. I  have not seen any in Congress refusing COVID vaccines either because of pharma industry profits. ",6,5,5,5,21,,Good
8,"Capitalism is not going to be what defeats COVID-19. While there are monetary incentives for companies to create a COVID vaccine in the end the vaccines are being given to citizens for free. Capitalism, and large companies desires to create a successful vaccine for recognition and monetary awards does isn't the only only factor. Government agencies are funneling funds into COVID vaccine research. The vaccines created are being given to the public for free after being obtained by the Government. That is socialism, and therefore capitalism is not defeating COVID-19. Capitalistic desire for monetary gain combined with Government socialism is working to get the COVID-19 pandemic under-control. Vaccine creation could not have been done without socialism based programs such as unemployment, food stamps, stimulus aid to the nation, stimulus money for COVID-19 research. Governmental finanical support is also socialism for the vaccine. That is not capitalism at play. ",8,7,4,6,25,,Good
9,"I am not sure what the ultimate point of this article is?  Is the premise that we don't have enough sanctions on Russia for its past behavior?  We currently yield zero influence on Russia's internal politics and power structure.  Further isolating Russia would only push it toward the Chinese sphere of influence.  I don't think that this would be smart strategically or geopolitically for the US to do.  We deal with a plethora of bad actors on the world scene, what makes Putin and Russia so different?

Which country was the most consequential ally of ours in world war II, Russia. Which nuclear power was our ally in the war against extremist terror particularly ISIS? Russia. Which country currently is helping US bring back our troops home from Afghanistan?  Which country established a space lab and let the USA collaborate on space exploration? Russia.

10,"I have managed organizations with unions all my professional career.  One thing is clear, Unions do not care about the product their members make, sick people they serve in hospitals or children they teach.  General Motors went bankrupt largely due to union contracts.  Of course GM management could have said said no but they were afraid of a strike.   Unionized nurses will walk out on sick patients they are sworn by their oath to care for.  Teachers claim they have the children's best interest at the core of their mission.  All of this is BS.  I am on the Board of Directors of a small Catholic  K-8 school who is in the middle of a very poor part of the city.   There are 19 different languages spoken by these students from 49 different countries. Their cost per pupil is $5,500 per year.   This is compared to the $16,000 per pupil in the public schools.

That's the result of the politicalization  of the virus under Trump.  Many people felt we never got the full truth from our health care 'experts' who turned out not to be experts in the truth.

Remember too, in Feb. the befuddled Biden along with his ""expert"" Fauci were telling us that covid would be around until 2022.  In the weeks since then, cases, deaths and hospitalizations have continued to fall, so now suddenly the narrative is different.   It doesn't really matter though.  Biden's political history the last 40 years, has been piggybacking on or taking the credit of accomplishments of better men.  And that was even before his sad but obvious mental decline.   The bottom line is Trump's actions had 20-25 million Americans vaccinated before Confused Joe even got to DC.  Pretending that didn't happen is just comical TDS at this point.

There were a dozen or more of them in the checkout lines.  Some folks had two.  And they were the huge screens--the ones that need a flatbed cart to carry out, not a measly grocery-store type cart.

However, the wife was complaining about having to change the filter too often, so I did it now. I figured the well guy would bid $2,800 because that's how much a husband / wife receive. He bid it at $2,784. After he did it, the neighbor asked how much he charged. The neighbor said the same well guy had done that for him for $2,100 last year, but with the stimulus, the well guy figured $2,800 would become the new going rate. So, 25% inflation for that job. My son had to pay $1,500 to go on a week-long soiree to Disneyland with his fiancé's parents and siblings. He was mildly disturbed, because he'd wanted to spend the money  upgrading his Jeep.

Also, to put a damper on reddit's usual WW3 wanking, the Rand Corporation did a study a few years back exploring possible US-China war scenarios.

Is it common for NDAs to protect organizations from harassment cases like this? If an organization was doing something criminal would an NDA also protect them from people being witnesses?",10,10,7,10,,,Bad
23,"According to the American Bar Association, it's complicated: Private employers commonly require employees to sign confidentiality agreements at the start of their employment to protect the company’s trade secrets and business information. Typically, these contracts have a provision that defines the phrase “confidential information,” usually followed by examples of the types of business information the contract is designed to protect. Depending on the wording at issue, the definition of “confidential information” may include disclosures about unlawful conduct in the workplace. Employers also tend to have social media policies that place restrictions on how and what employees post in their own time, warning them, for example, not to disclose the company’s intellectual property. These policies are usually vaguely worded and often contain an exception for disclosures “protected by law.” Even if these contracts seem to prohibit disclosures of misconduct or unlawful activity, there is some support for the idea that disclosures relating to workplace harassment are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That means that an employer cannot retaliate against an employee for complaining about workplace harassment. However, there is also a body of case law saying that if the employee is excessively disruptive or unreasonable in the way he or she complains, that protection can disappear. In other words, there are good legal reasons to believe it is permissible for employees to publicly disclose workplace harassment, but they should be thoughtful about how they do it. After reading the whole article, it sounds like it depends on local laws and the specific wording of the NDA. As for the second question, Wikipedia has a more straightforward answer: Like all contracts, they cannot be enforced if the contracted activities are illegal.",6,10,7,9,32,,Good
23,"Even if it's legally unenforceable it works well as a deterrent. Regardless of whether it will stand to scrutiny in a court of law, the legal representatives of the party that forced you to sign the NDA are going to threaten you about it. Being threatened about a clause in a contract you did sign is a great deterrent from bringing any grievances forward or telling any stories. If your lawyer believes the clause is unenforceable/invalid, they are still up against it to prove it. All the while the other party is saying you are violating your contract and they are going to make a meal of you. Then you are at the mercy of the judge agreeing with your lawyer once it does get to a hearing. And this is exactly how Trump uses his NDAs. He forces everyone to sign draconian NDAs, regardless of any legal merit they may hold, because the empty threat is enough to make most people keep their mouths shut. It's worked his whole life. He was able to get even WH workers to sign them, which seems to be unconstitutional but we won't have the final word until someone tests it in a court of law. For the first time someone in the campaign decided to test it, and only because they felt so grieved from feeling sexually harassed and discriminated that they were willing to start the fight and take the gamble in front of the judge. But now that the ruling is through, other many people with stories to tell may realize their NDA is unenforceable and decide to come forward and start telling their own stories.",8,4,0,8,20,,Good

It'll be more cases like this, harassment and such, where the limiting factors also include all the other reasons people are generally hesitant to speak up about sensitive topics. If there were someone who wanted to talk about shady finances or foreign influence or fraud, that person could have pretty easily found a legal champion.",9,7,0,6,22,,Good

In the meantime, we were informed that supermarkets and drugstores would have the vaccines. Getting an appointment was an exercise in frustration - trying repeatedly to sign up for appointments that disappeared before one could hit “confirm”. People put their names on numerous waiting lists and different vaccine providers seemed to be applying different rules of eligibility. Most people I know in southeastern MI have driven for hours to other parts of the state or even to neighboring states. I personally drove four hours each way to get mine. It would’ve made so much more sense to work with the big hospitals and medical centers that could sift through their computer data to identify those eligible and/or at heightened risk and offer a vaccine from a trusted source, closer to home.

If any of you commenters would have told me back in 2019 Biden would be president in 2021 I would NOT have believed you. But . . . . sadly, tragically, here we are as CO2 edges closely, solidly (no turning back only rising) to 420 ppm, oceans acidifying, climate chaos, a pandemic (exacerbated if not caused by humans behaviors) and the u.s. neoliberal, capitalist machine pushed on to bring this dithering oligarchic shill to head up the u.s… Here is an excerpt from Bold Iowa dot com that summarized the candidates standings on DAPL in 2019. From ~http://boldiowa.com/release-presidential-candidates-speak-out-about-dapl/: They preface Biden’s statements by writing “Confusing”! (no sh$t!—the only thing missing  here is his oft used starting words of “Cmon man”!) Biden’s nonsensical mess of thoughts (in italics below) is an example of why I did not think he would make it this far---- I thought he would collapse cognitively prior to election----he makes no sense! Iowa paper journalist writes: JOE BIDEN . ""Biden wants it both ways. In response to questions by Ed Fallon and Kathy Byrnes after the CNN town hall in Grinnell on November 11, Biden says he’s against pipelines. Immediately after that, he says he wants to replace existing pipelines, which would lock in further greenhouse gas emissions. And we have no idea what he is talking about when he refers to being “able to make sure we can travel this way.” ~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knm-AgOqK0Q&feature=emb_title Biden’s attempt at responding to the question about DAPL (which of course he doesn’t even mention in his “response”): “All you guys in Iowa are pains in the neck, you know that? ‘I want a personal statement from you. I want you to sign this.’ Take my word. I’ve never broken my word. I’ve been opposed to the pipeline to begin with. … We have in America right now gas pipelines put in in the 1960s. Guess what? They’re leaking methane. They’re hurting people. They’re killing people. You ready to pay more taxes to make sure we dig them up and make great jobs and put new pipelines down to be able to make sure we can travel this way?” Here is what Harris and Sanders said: KAMALA HARRIS . “Not only should we not increase the flow of oil through the Dakota Access Pipeline, but as president I would end federal support for the pipeline entirely. For too long big oil companies have been allowed to pollute our environment and our Native American communities in pursuit of more money. That ends when I’m president. I will stop the authorization of new fossil fuel infrastructures, as we must make big changes now to protect our planet and our children’s future.” BERNIE SANDERS . “If this expansion plan goes through, it would be a disaster for Americans’ health, clean water and our climate. I am proud to have fought the Dakota Access pipeline when it was first proposed and I continue to stand with the communities who have been fighting it every step of the way. As president, I will shut down the Dakota Access pipeline that should never have been built in the first place.” It’s water, oil, tar sands under the bridge now I know but I believe in my heart we would not be having this discussion if Sanders were POTUS. But here we are . . April 2021 and this horror for indigenous water protectors (and many others including nonhuman life) goes on . . . over 5 years. I’ve read some confusing things about line 3. Before Biden was inaugurated I read he could stop it on day 1. Then I read he can’t . . . . it’s not within his power. This, from 2 months ago: “The appeals court put the ball squarely in the court of the Biden administration to take action,” Hasselman said. “And I mean shutting the pipeline down until this environmental review is completed.” Forgive my ignorance on this but I wish there could be an article that very simply, concisely outlines what exactly he could have done by now to stop this once and for all. Would this be some sort of binding executive action? Could he kill it once and for all? Obviously Biden is choosing not to do this. It’s not like he doesn’t know this is going on! WTF??? Why is he (and whoever) stalling? I mean . . . what are the specifics here -----as in: who has his ear, what the hell is going on? Who is calling the shots? It brings me back to that sickening part of his recent covid address to the public when he spoke of only being concerned with giving the “American people the truth”. In that sickly faux empathy voice. Right. It would be nice to know what exactly is going on with DAPL. I know there could be a lot of angry, short responses to the questions I pose that won’t really provide specifics and will include blame to those that voted for Biden. All I can say to that is I get it. I hate that Biden is POTUS. And if we had trump we wouldn’t be having this discussion either but not in the way I speak of above when talking of Sanders as POTUS. Fantasy, dream world scenario with a decent, wise human being as president: Decent, wise (fantasy) POTUS stops DAPL and apologizes for taking so long to do so! (LOL) or If he can’t stop it permanently then he goes to the protests, listens to and speaks to the people. Speaks the truth about what is really going on, where the hold up is and what we can to together to stop it which he will fully support. Back in February, CD’s had a piece about DAPL with this excerpt from Dems who wrote a letter to Biden -----“encouraging” (urging) him to do the right thing: “As you consider how to proceed,” the Democrats write, “we encourage you to meet with members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other impacted tribes to better understand how the DAPL affects their lands, treaty rights, and environmental priorities.” Again, the fact that he nor Harris have met with members of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe speaks volumes. This excerpt from an article 12 days ago: ~https://globalnews.ca/news/7709786/oil-gas-leaders-north-america-stalemate/ The DAPL case is widely seen as a likely bellwether for the pipeline industry in the U.S., where both Vice-President Kamala Harris and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, America’s first Indigenous cabinet member, support shutting it down.

The same study found no evidence that deflation in the price of goods and services is associated with any slowdown in GDP growth.  In fact in many cases they found it is positively associated with higher real productivity and wealth.  

In the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, central banks around the world continue to falsely assume consumer price deflation is dangerous and must be avoided, while simultaneously ignoring (and fueling) the real enemy, asset price inflation.

Do they think the hundreds of murders in Chicago or other large cities will be stopped by their recent actions? If so I suggest their thoughts are pipe dreams.

Are suicides committed by belt violence any less tragic? Treating them separately is a failed way to help reduce them. There are far more suicides than murders. Far more potential lives to be saved and no political fight over a proposal that would save few lives even if all guns magically vanished.

Most murders are committed with ordinary handguns and in highly concentrated locations. In Chicago for example, if you look neighborhood by neighborhood, there are neighborhoods with murder rates that are consistently 100x higher than other neighborhoods. Why? Clearly, it is not access to guns that causes murder rates to plummet over the scale of a few miles. That's where large number of lives can be saved.",8,7,,8,23,,Good
