8,"It's about time Big Pharma does something right. Public Citizen has found that the pharmaceutical industry is the biggest defrauder of the federal government under the False Claims Act of any industry, worse than big tobacco. Big Pharma blames price increases on research costs, but most pharmaceutical companies don’t fund any research; the 210 drugs that were patented by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 were all developed with NIH money, some $100 billion. Remember when Trump promised lower drug prices?  Big Pharma spent $280 million in both 2017 and 2018 lobbying Alex Azar and the dozen Pharma lobbyists Trump appointed  to HHS. While at Eli Lilly, Azar hiked the price of insulin -- developed in the 1920s -- from $21 to $255. The results are predictable: Fortune reported that drug makers raised the prices on 250 drugs in 2018; in addition, Trump’s renegotiated USMCA increased the patent rights of biologics to 12 years, insuring continued high drug prices.

23,"According to the American Bar Association, it's complicated: Private employers commonly require employees to sign confidentiality agreements at the start of their employment to protect the company’s trade secrets and business information. Typically, these contracts have a provision that defines the phrase “confidential information,” usually followed by examples of the types of business information the contract is designed to protect. Depending on the wording at issue, the definition of “confidential information” may include disclosures about unlawful conduct in the workplace. Employers also tend to have social media policies that place restrictions on how and what employees post in their own time, warning them, for example, not to disclose the company’s intellectual property. These policies are usually vaguely worded and often contain an exception for disclosures “protected by law.” Even if these contracts seem to prohibit disclosures of misconduct or unlawful activity, there is some support for the idea that disclosures relating to workplace harassment are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That means that an employer cannot retaliate against an employee for complaining about workplace harassment. However, there is also a body of case law saying that if the employee is excessively disruptive or unreasonable in the way he or she complains, that protection can disappear. In other words, there are good legal reasons to believe it is permissible for employees to publicly disclose workplace harassment, but they should be thoughtful about how they do it. After reading the whole article, it sounds like it depends on local laws and the specific wording of the NDA. As for the second question, Wikipedia has a more straightforward answer: Like all contracts, they cannot be enforced if the contracted activities are illegal.",6.0,10.0,7.0,9.0,32.0,1,1.7926654322421245,0.3178948513273045,False,0.4437142140471724,1.7926654322421245,0.3178948513273045,1.5185863158564143,0.25194362609587384,0.2761404165539178,1.5185863158564143,4,0,1868,False,[False]
23,"Even if it's legally unenforceable it works well as a deterrent. Regardless of whether it will stand to scrutiny in a court of law, the legal representatives of the party that forced you to sign the NDA are going to threaten you about it. Being threatened about a clause in a contract you did sign is a great deterrent from bringing any grievances forward or telling any stories. If your lawyer believes the clause is unenforceable/invalid, they are still up against it to prove it. All the while the other party is saying you are violating your contract and they are going to make a meal of you. Then you are at the mercy of the judge agreeing with your lawyer once it does get to a hearing. And this is exactly how Trump uses his NDAs. He forces everyone to sign draconian NDAs, regardless of any legal merit they may hold, because the empty threat is enough to make most people keep their mouths shut. It's worked his whole life. He was able to get even WH workers to sign them, which seems to be unconstitutional but we won't have the final word until someone tests it in a court of law. For the first time someone in the campaign decided to test it, and only because they felt so grieved from feeling sexually harassed and discriminated that they were willing to start the fight and take the gamble in front of the judge.

If any of you commenters would have told me back in 2019 Biden would be president in 2021 I would NOT have believed you. But . . . . sadly, tragically, here we are as CO2 edges closely, solidly (no turning back only rising) to 420 ppm, oceans acidifying, climate chaos, a pandemic (exacerbated if not caused by humans behaviors) and the u.s. neoliberal, capitalist machine pushed on to bring this dithering oligarchic shill to head up the u.s… Here is an excerpt from Bold Iowa dot com that summarized the candidates standings on DAPL in 2019. From ~http://boldiowa.com/release-presidential-candidates-speak-out-about-dapl/: They preface Biden’s statements by writing “Confusing”! (no sh$t!—the only thing missing  here is his oft used starting words of “Cmon man”!) Biden’s nonsensical mess of thoughts (in italics below) is an example of why I did not think he would make it this far---- I thought he would collapse cognitively prior to election----he makes no sense! Iowa paper journalist writes: JOE BIDEN . ""Biden wants it both ways. In response to questions by Ed Fallon and Kathy Byrnes after the CNN town hall in Grinnell on November 11, Biden says he’s against pipelines. Immediately after that, he says he wants to replace existing pipelines, which would lock in further greenhouse gas emissions. And we have no idea what he is talking about when he refers to being “able to make sure we can travel this way.” ~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knm-AgOqK0Q&feature=emb_title Biden’s attempt at responding to the question about DAPL (which of course he doesn’t even mention in his “response”): “All you guys in Iowa are pains in the neck, you know that? ‘I want a personal statement from you. I want you to sign this.’ Take my word. I’ve never broken my word. I’ve been opposed to the pipeline to begin with. … We have in America right now gas pipelines put in in the 1960s. Guess what? They’re leaking methane. They’re hurting people. They’re killing people. You ready to pay more taxes to make sure we dig them up and make great jobs and put new pipelines down to be able to make sure we can travel this way?” Here is what Harris and Sanders said: KAMALA HARRIS . “Not only should we not increase the flow of oil through the Dakota Access Pipeline, but as president I would end federal support for the pipeline entirely. For too long big oil companies have been allowed to pollute our environment and our Native American communities in pursuit of more money. That ends when I’m president. I will stop the authorization of new fossil fuel infrastructures, as we must make big changes now to protect our planet and our children’s future.” BERNIE SANDERS . “If this expansion plan goes through, it would be a disaster for Americans’ health, clean water and our climate. I am proud to have fought the Dakota Access pipeline when it was first proposed and I continue to stand with the communities who have been fighting it every step of the way. As president, I will shut down the Dakota Access pipeline that should never have been built in the first place.” It’s water, oil, tar sands under the bridge now I know but I believe in my heart we would not be having this discussion if Sanders were POTUS. But here we are . . April 2021 and this horror for indigenous water protectors (and many others including nonhuman life) goes on . . . over 5 years. I’ve read some confusing things about line 3. Before Biden was inaugurated I read he could stop it on day 1. Then I read he can’t . . . . it’s not within his power. This, from 2 months ago: “The appeals court put the ball squarely in the court of the Biden administration to take action,” Hasselman said. “And I mean shutting the pipeline down until this environmental review is completed.” Forgive my ignorance on this but I wish there could be an article that very simply, concisely outlines what exactly he could have done by now to stop this once and for all. Would this be some sort of binding executive action? Could he kill it once and for all? Obviously Biden is choosing not to do this. It’s not like he doesn’t know this is going on! WTF??? Why is he (and whoever) stalling? I mean . . . what are the specifics here -----as in: who has his ear, what the hell is going on? Who is calling the shots? It brings me back to that sickening part of his recent covid address to the public when he spoke of only being concerned with giving the “American people the truth”. In that sickly faux empathy voice. Right. It would be nice to know what exactly is going on with DAPL. I know there could be a lot of angry, short responses to the questions I pose that won’t really provide specifics and will include blame to those that voted for Biden. All I can say to that is I get it. I hate that Biden is POTUS. And if we had trump we wouldn’t be having this discussion either but not in the way I speak of above when talking of Sanders as POTUS. Fantasy, dream world scenario with a decent, wise human being as president: Decent, wise (fantasy) POTUS stops DAPL and apologizes for taking so long to do so! (LOL) or If he can’t stop it permanently then he goes to the protests, listens to and speaks to the people. Speaks the truth about what is really going on, where the hold up is and what we can to together to stop it which he will fully support. Back in February, CD’s had a piece about DAPL with this excerpt from Dems who wrote a letter to Biden -----“encouraging” (urging) him to do the right thing: “As you consider how to proceed,” the Democrats write, “we encourage you to meet with members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other impacted tribes to better understand how the DAPL affects their lands, treaty rights, and environmental priorities.” Again, the fact that he nor Harris have met with members of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe speaks volumes. This excerpt from an article 12 days ago: ~https://globalnews.ca/news/7709786/oil-gas-leaders-north-america-stalemate/ The DAPL case is widely seen as a likely bellwether for the pipeline industry in the U.S., where both Vice-President Kamala Harris and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, America’s first Indigenous cabinet member, support shutting it down.

39,"The Fed is fighting the wrong war. 

Its 2% inflation target is wrongly focused on consumer price inflation.  It should instead be focused on asset price inflation. 

A study of 38 countries over 140 years published in 2015 by the BIS found that asset price deflation created from the bursting of stock or housing bubbles is strongly correlated with falling GDP and lower real productivity and wealth. The same study found no evidence that deflation in the price of goods and services is associated with any slowdown in GDP growth.  In fact in many cases they found it is positively associated with higher real productivity and wealth.  

In the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, central banks around the world continue to falsely assume consumer price deflation is dangerous and must be avoided, while simultaneously ignoring (and fueling) the real enemy, asset price inflation.

70,"Liberals are bad at actual problem solving because they define a problem so poorly. ""Gun Violence"" as they define it is largely suicide. We all want to minimize suicides, gun control won't do it. Robin Williams would have probably used a gun if he had one. Not having didn't stop him.  Are suicides committed by belt violence any less tragic? Treating them separately is a failed way to help reduce them. There are far more suicides than murders. Far more potential lives to be saved and no political fight over a proposal that would save few lives even if all guns magically vanished.

Most murders are committed with ordinary handguns and in highly concentrated locations.

And a percentage of d0pes voted for the act that was Biden thinking he represented the working class. 

The working class are now under direct attack by the Democrats.  Their productive independence is anathema to the leftist dream of socialized everything where the looters and moochers reign supreme.  

The problem we have now is that the working class is dwindling in numbers as the Democrats farm out more dependent voters that realize there is free money to be had.   I have older working class family members and friends that want some of that UBI.    They have no clue or care what the consequences will be.  Everyone wants more, and so they are easily duped into becoming another moocher.

74,"The GOP acts like Biden owes them something, that he needs to govern according to the principles they themselves abandoned to curry favor with Trump.

The first step in bipartisanship is up to the GOP. It is to say unequivocally that Biden won a free and fair election and is the legitimate president of the country. Instead party leaders provide cover for the likes of Greene, Gaetz, et al.
