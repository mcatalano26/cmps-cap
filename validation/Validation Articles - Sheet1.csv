0,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-are-the-stimulus-checks-coming-and-who-will-get-one-11615216538?mod=cxrecs_join#cxrecs_s,"WASHINGTON—Another round of stimulus checks is heading to bank accounts now that President Biden has signed the coronavirus relief legislation into law, and money is starting to reach people this weekend.  When are the payments coming?  Officials from the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service said the government sent the first batch of direct deposits on Friday. Some households may see the money over the weekend. The official payment date is March 17, and it may take that long for the payments to clear at some banks. Subsequent batches of direct deposits will happen over the coming weeks.  The IRS has recent experience sending out payments, and that is a good guide for what to expect now. Last year, when former President Donald Trump signed the first big relief bill in March, the bulk of direct deposits arrived within about two weeks. The second round of payments, approved in December, hit bank accounts within a few days after Mr. Trump signed them into law.  How big are the payments?  The latest payments are $1,400 per household member, including adults, children and adult dependents such as college students and elderly relatives. Adult dependents were ineligible for prior rounds of payments.  The $1,400 comes on top of the $600 approved in December, so people will be receiving a total of $2,000 between the two rounds of payments, fulfilling a Democratic promise."

As in much of the U.S., many parents in Los Angeles are eager for children to return to in-person classes, particularly as the region’s Covid-19 case rates plummet after one of the worst surges in the country late last year. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Austin Beutner, who wants elementary schools to open next month, recently secured 25,000 vaccine doses from the state—enough for all the teachers and staff who work with children in sixth grade and below.  But United Teachers Los Angeles, which established itself as one of the most powerful public-employee unions in the U.S. during a 2019 strike, has remained noncommittal, and it is unclear whether it will agree to return to work before the end of the school year. The union says that in addition to the vaccinations for school staffers, it wants Los Angeles County to reach a lower rate of coronavirus spread and for schools to institute safety protocols including social distancing, personal protective equipment for teachers and staff, and better ventilation in buildings.  The showdown has become a test of how much influence a strong urban union can exercise over education policy.  The provisions UTLA is demanding go beyond those in a $6.6 billion aid package—signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last week—that would dock some money from schools that don’t reopen elementary grades by March 31. With 9% of California public-school students in the LAUSD, the union could put a significant dent in Mr. Newsom’s goal of having children return to in-person learning next month. With about 550,000 students, Los Angeles trails only New York City among the country’s largest school districts."
2,3,https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news/contrasting-coverage-of-meghan-and-prince-andrew-7813644,"Opinion  Published: 7:00 AM March 12, 2021  LIZ GERARD on what is behind the contrast in coverage between the two royals.  Why does the press hate Meghan? Why does it give her such a hard time and Prince Andrew such an easy ride? It must be because of her colour, her nationality, her gender, her wokeness. Or so at least one planet in the Twittersphere would have us believe. But is it true?  It certainly seems so from the current festival of outrage, from the stripping of royal patronages to the pregnancy picture, the bullying allegations to the wearing of certain earrings – culminating in the “bombshell” interview with Oprah Winfrey. Indeed, our newspapers have printed almost six times as many (mostly negative) stories about Meghan since she met Harry five years ago as they have about Andrew since the Epstein allegations surfaced in 2007.  “It’s a side show,” Palace aides told the Mail on Sunday of the Oprah gig. People were more interested in schools going back, being vaccinated and the Duke of Edinburgh getting out of hospital. “Most of what is said will be lost in the mists of time.”  A side show worth 12 pages in that paper before the event and 27 pages in its daily sister the day after? An interview that will be lost in the mists of time? Just as that one with Diana 25 years ago was?        You may also want to watch:  One page of the coverage said there were “fears” Prince Andrew would be “dragged into” an investigation into bullying allegations against Meghan, that Palace aides were “bracing themselves” for complaints against him to surface. Last week, with astonishingly serendipitous timing, the Times had reported that two people had left Kensington Palace, citing Meghan’s behaviour towards them. Within 24 hours, the Palace had announced an inquiry. Over the years, various papers have reported on staff members accusing Andrew of shouting and abusive behaviour that left people “trembling” and “in tears”. But there has been no Palace inquiry.  The Palace does a lot of no-commenting, while the people who work there do a lot of briefing and leaking. When it comes to Meghan, they may be telling it how it is – she may be an attention-seeking diva, a knowing actress playing the ingénue in asserting that she didn’t even know who Harry was (in spite of reportedly being friendly with Princess Eugenie) before she found herself incarcerated in her castle. Or she may have been left to flounder in choppy waters with no one offering so much as a rubber ring to help her float. It’s not as though that’s an unfamiliar story. Remember Diana?  Virtually all we know – or think we know – comes through the press and virtually all the press prints comes from anonymous “insiders”. What is without doubt is that the press is always, but always, on the side of “the Royal Family”. The bottom line is 'royals sell', hence the paradox of “nobody cares about the Sussexes” while printing page upon page about their antics. They may be attention-seeking, but it is possible to look away if you choose. Just as there’s no law that papers must print a picture every time Boris Johnson dons a hi-vis jacket and hard hat to jump on a JCB, there’s no requirement to put M&H on the front page every time they open their mouths. But they do. And because they do, they have to go absolutely bananas when the PM troubles to do something important or the Sussexes threaten to destroy the monarchy.  It isn’t about news values. It isn’t about loving Boris or hating Meghan. It’s about business and trying to hang on to readers by echoing and reinforcing their opinions. Opinions that can change. As they did with Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Johnson in politics and with Sarah Ferguson, Camilla, Kate and now Meghan in the Royal Family.  Ask journalists why the press is so cruel to Meghan and they’ll point to the way Fergie was mocked for her weight and denounced as “vulgar, vulgar, vulgar” by courtiers, long before the toe-curling toe-sucking photos emerged. They’ll point to the “waity Katie” jibes, the “doors to manual” allusions to Carole Middleton’s air stewardess background. They’ll remind us of the years of hostility endured by the Duchess of Cornwall – to the extent of being pelted with bread rolls in Waitrose – before her adulterous past and her present husband’s tampon fantasies were put aside to allow her to metamorphose into the “good old girl” she is today.  Which is all a bit like Matt Hancock telling nurses that they should be happy with a tiny bit more money because others are getting nothing. “We’re horrible to everyone – and we were even nastier to someone else” isn’t the greatest defence.  Those defenders of the way Meghan is treated in print insist that neither they nor their papers hate anyone. And they are probably right. They have their political and philosophical agendas and the stories they carry and the prominence they give them reflect those agendas. They don’t hate Meghan any more than they hated migrants: they are there to be used to further their business interests – whether by attracting readers or by helping to create the political environment most likely to allow their enterprise to flourish.  Of course they’re more likely to put a beautiful young Duchess on the front than a portly 60-year-old Duke. But there has to be a reason, however flimsy, to put either of them there. Meghan has supplied plenty of reasons of late; the press didn’t need to go looking. And by any measure, the Oprah interview was news dynamite. The Duke, on the other hand, has wisely kept quiet for a while – and now fans of the Duchess want to know why the papers aren’t digging.  Anyone can see that involvement – however tangentially – with sex trafficking is more important than which of two duchesses made the other cry (though racism and suicidal thoughts are pretty big issues). But what more, exactly, do we expect the press to uncover at this particular moment with regard to Andrew’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein? The FBI is still waiting to talk to him. Epstein’s victims have repeatedly had their say. Ghislaine Maxwell is on remand awaiting a trial this summer. The story just isn’t moving right now.  Which isn’t to say that our papers haven’t been on his case since the first questions were asked about his friendship with Epstein and Maxwell 14 years ago. That “anti-Meghan rag” the Mail on Sunday was the first to report claims – strenuously denied – that the Duke “groped” a teenager who said she had been groomed by Epstein in 2007, and both Mail titles have returned to the subject year after year after year. And not just to those dodgy friendships. They have also highlighted allegations of his “boorish” behaviour and freeloading, his questionable trade deals, his reported links with shady businessmen, despotic rulers and corrupt regimes.  And all the while, the Palace has protected him as far as it can. He “stepped back” from royal duties not out of remorse or after Palace censure, but because he was toxic and no one wanted him to cut their ribbons. He is so disgraced that he couldn’t even appear in the public photographs of his daughter’s wedding. Yet, a week after that Newsnight interview (to which the Mail devoted 12 pages as dismissive and contemptuous of Andrew as this week’s assault on Meghan), the Queen gave him a mother’s vote of confidence by taking him on her morning ride.  Journalists, like many of their readers, are impatient with Meghan, but the people really hanging her out to dry while shielding Andrew are in the Palace.  For the press, the Royal Family is a soap opera. Think of it in terms of The Archers. The matriarch, Jill Archer, is ever-present, ever-revered. The stalwarts focus on fixed events, such as the village fete. The youngsters are wilder, more challenging of old ways. Everyone has their moment in the spotlight and that is what is happening to Meghan (and the pregnant Alice in Ambridge) now. But sometimes the natural flow of cricket matches, produce shows and pantomimes is disrupted by a far more serious storyline. Like a man coercively controlling his wife. Or a “nice” builder using slave labour. That is where Andrew comes in. The moment that Ghislaine Maxwell trial starts, Meghan and her baby daughter will fade into the background, while Andrew will be thrust centre stage. And you can bet he will be sweating then.  NO EASY RIDE  In September 2007, the Mail on Sunday carried a spread by Wendy Leigh headlined “Prince Andrew’s friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, some underage girls and a very disturbing story”. In it, a young woman alleged that she had been groomed by Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell and that Prince Andrew had groped her breast at a party. Epstein was about to plead guilty to sex offences and would be jailed. But the Prince maintained their friendship. And the Mail papers maintained their interest in it. And in Andrew’s business dealings. And in Andrew’s personal finances. And in his behaviour at home and abroad.  What do you think?

3,4,https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=hp_lead_pos1,"The Justice Department is investigating whether Visa Inc. is engaging in anticompetitive practices in the debit-card market, a probe that casts a cloud over a core part of its business.  The department’s antitrust division has been gathering information and asking whether Visa, the largest U.S. card network, has limited merchants’ ability to route debit-card transactions over card networks that are often less expensive, according to people familiar with the matter.  Many of the department’s questions have focused on online debit-card transactions, but investigators have asked about in-store issues as well, the people said.  The probe highlights the important role of the so-called network fees that are invisible to consumers, lucrative for card companies, but a weight on merchants, who often pass on the fees in the form of higher prices to customers.  It comes as Justice Department antitrust enforcers across administrations have placed an emphasis on scrutinizing digital-marketplace activities, including in the financial sector, and on investigating the business practices of dominant firms."
4,5,https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-buys-more-iranian-and-venezuelan-oil-in-a-test-for-biden-11616146203?mod=politics_lead_pos4,"China has sharply increased its imports of oil from Iran and Venezuela in a challenge to two Biden administration foreign-policy priorities, according to U.S. officials, undermining key diplomatic leverage Washington needs to restart long-stalled negotiations.  China is expected to import 918,000 barrels a day from Iran in March, which would be the highest volume since a full U.S. oil embargo was imposed against Tehran two years ago, according to commodities-data company Kpler.  That trend is confirmed by other shipping trackers, some of which see those sales at 1 million barrels a day.  “If it sells 1 million barrels a day at current prices, Iran has no incentive to negotiate,” said Sara Vakhshouri, president of Washington-based SVB Energy International and an expert on Iran’s oil industry.  President Biden’s administration has sought to engage with Iran to return to a 2015 nuclear deal that was exited by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. But Tehran has rebuffed overtures so far."
5,6,https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-to-vote-on-immigration-bills-offering-paths-to-citizenship-11616083508?mod=politics_lead_pos3,"WASHINGTON—The House passed two bills providing pathways to citizenship for certain categories of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, in a show of bipartisan support for narrow measures that still risk getting tied up in a long-running impasse over how to repair the immigration system.  By 228-197, the House voted to create a path to citizenship for young immigrants known as Dreamers who came to the U.S. before the age of 19 and have lived in the country illegally, as well as hundreds of thousands of immigrants living in the U.S. under a humanitarian program that provides temporary protection to people suffering from extraordinary conditions like war or natural disasters.  President Biden hailed the bill’s passage in the House, calling it “a critical first step in reforming our immigration system.”  A second bill, passed by a vote of 247-174 with 30 Republicans in favor and a single Democrat against, sets out a path to citizenship for farmworkers in the country illegally and their family members. Both bills have been expected to pass the Democratic-led House with support from some Republicans sympathetic to the people affected, seeing them as being in the country through no fault of their own or as essential members of the workforce.  The fate of both bills in the evenly divided Democratic-led Senate is uncertain."
6,7,https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-gang-that-couldnt-shot-straight-11616193641?mod=opinion_lead_pos1,"It’s hard to think of a recent fiasco that can match the European Union’s Covid vaccine rollout. Protectionism, mercantilism, bureaucratic ineptitude, lack of political accountability, crippling safety-ism—it’s all here. The Keystone Kops in Brussels and European capitals would be funny if the consequences weren’t so serious.  But hospitalizations and deaths are rising again in Italy, Germany and France while successful vaccinations suppress illness and fatalities in the U.S., United Kingdom and Israel. To date the U.S. has administered 34 doses per 100 residents, the U.K. has jabbed 40, and Israel has 111. Most vaccines require two doses. Compare that to about 12 in France, Germany and Italy.  As the pandemic moves into its reopening phase, Europe’s mistakes will cost the rest of the world economically as the Continent struggles to exit lockdowns.  ***  Take the latest fumble first. Various European regulators and politicians spent this week claiming the Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccine—the only one currently widely available in the EU—might be unsafe, only to rethink and now beg people to start accepting it.  This time the concern was that the jab caused blood clotting or problems with blood platelets in some patients. Some people who received the vaccine developed blood clots, but the European Medicines Agency (EMA) found the vaccine was not associated with an increase in the overall risk."
7,8,https://www.wsj.com/articles/capitalism-is-what-will-defeat-covid-11616192690?mod=opinion_lead_pos6,"Behold the paradox of this pandemic moment: Large corporations are political villains, derided on the left and right. Yet the main, and perhaps only, reason the Covid-19 scourge is easing is vaccines developed by Big Pharma.  Few are more acutely aware of this paradox than Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson , the healthcare device, pharmaceutical and consumer-goods company best known for products like Band-Aids and Tylenol. Politicians have vilified his industry over prescription-drug prices, and trial lawyers for using talc in its baby powder, which it discontinued in North America in 2020. But now J&J is a household name in the best way for developing its single-shot Covid vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration approved for emergency use last month. The vaccine is increasing the U.S. supply of shots at a critical time and will enable a billion people world-wide to be vaccinated this year.  J&J’s road to the vaccine—from failure to life-saving success, from investment write-off to breakthrough—is a little-known story about science, business risk and innovation. There are also lessons for those who think capitalism is merely about rapacious profit.  “We would never be in the position where we are today if we had not invested billions of dollars over decades so that we could respond,” Mr. Gorsky, 60, says in an interview the Monday morning after the FDA authorized its Covid vaccine. The U.S. Army veteran had been up since 3:30 a.m., getting in one of his early-morning workouts before meetings. J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine development over the last year has been a sprint, but the process that led to it has been a decades-long marathon.  Vaccines such as those for polio, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and seasonal flu have been made from weakened or inactivated viruses. But patients often produce a weak immune response to the inactivated viruses, and shots that use weakened viruses can make immunocompromised people sick. The manufacturing process is also laborious."
8,9,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-should-follow-his-killer-instinct-11616345729?mod=opinion_lead_pos5,"President Biden said “I do” last week when asked if he believes Vladimir Putin is a “killer.” That’s a first step toward addressing Russian crimes openly, which would shield Russians in danger of repression and strengthen American security as well.  U.S. administrations have long been reluctant to call attention to Russian crimes. In February 2017, in an interview on Fox News, President Trump responded to the statement that Mr. Putin was a killer by suggesting American leaders are no better. “There are a lot of killers, we’ve got a lot of killers,” he said. “You think our country’s so innocent?”  Mr. Trump was widely condemned. But the readiness of U.S. officials to ignore Russian crimes has been bipartisan. When President Boris Yeltsin attacked Parliament with tanks in October 1993, Secretary of State Warren Christopher congratulated him on his victory. Despite Mr. Putin’s reputed ties to organized crime, President Bush said in 2001 that he had “looked the man in the eye” and “was able to get a sense of his soul.” In July 2009 President Obama described Mr. Putin as “sincere, just and deeply interested in the interests of the Russian people”—despite the polonium poisoning of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. An official British inquiry found Mr. Putin was probably personally responsible for his poisoning.  To an extent, when it comes to Russia, American leaders are superficial out of fear of what a serious effort to learn the truth might find. But the U.S., as guarantor of world stability, has the duty to gain full knowledge of Russian leaders’ crimes. Russia is run by 100 or so individuals who control 35% of the country’s assets. With free rein, there are few limits to the actions they can take against the outside world.  In three cases in particular, the U.S. should make every effort to understand and expose Russian crimes."
9,10,https://www.wsj.com/articles/andrew-yang-takes-on-the-unions-11616193518?mod=opinion_lead_pos2,"New York City families have become unwilling homeschoolers in the last year as the pandemic shutdowns stretch on and on. Credit mayoral candidate Andrew Yang for calling out the teachers unions for depriving children of opportunities to learn in-person.  “I will confess to being a parent that has been frustrated by how slow our schools have been to open, and I do believe that the UFT has been a significant reason why our schools have been slow to open,” Mr. Yang told Politico, referring to New York City’s powerful United Federation of Teachers.  Mr. Yang is right. The UFT endorsed current Mayor Bill de Blasio, and its parent union also gave $350,000 to the mayor’s nonprofit amid contract negotiations. Throughout the pandemic, the UFT has driven the classroom closures, leaving students and parents hostage to their demands.  High schools will finally reopen Monday, following elementary and middle schools. Yet under the “blended learning” system, students still get three days or fewer a week in-person. The New York Post reported Friday that about 70% of children in the New York City school system are still exclusively remote. The Post also reported in January that more than one in 10 students were absent, and in 134 schools a quarter or more of the students were missing from class. Wealthy parents can hire tutors or send children to private schools, but the learning loss for poor kids will result in disparities that could last a lifetime.  Mr. Yang also supports charter schools, which the unions have tried to destroy. “Unfortunately, I think the main argument [against charters] is a political one, where teachers unions hate charters,” he said in a 2019 interview. “Teachers’ unions are a very, very powerful constituency. And so some politicians have said ‘I’m better served by getting behind this point of view.’”"
10,11,https://www.wsj.com/articles/property-rights-at-the-supreme-court-11616193465?mod=opinion_lead_pos3,"The Supreme Court has sometimes treated property rights as the prodigal son of the Constitution, and on Monday the Justices have an opportunity to welcome it back with some rules on behavior.  At issue in Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid is a 1975 regulation by the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board that requires farmers to allow union organizers onto their property three hours a day for 120 days each year. In October 2015, union protesters barged with bullhorns onto Cedar Point’s land without prior notice and distracted workers preparing strawberry plants.  At the time some farm workers lived on the farms, and union organizers had few means to communicate unless granted access to farmers’ property. The Supreme Court in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox (1956) held that while a company usually has a right to exclude union organizers from its parking lots, that right could be limited “if reasonable efforts by the union through other available channels of communication” would not “enable it to reach the employees with its message.”  The Court’s hedge enabled the California board’s overreach, which has grown more flagrant with time. Most workers today don’t live on their employers’ land, and the union can reach them where they live or through targeted ads on social media.  Cedar Point Nursery and Fowler Packing Co. argue that California’s regulation is equivalent to a time-limited government easement and thus constitutes what’s known as a “per se” taking. The Constitution’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit governments from taking private property “for public use, without just compensation” and due process."
11,12,https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-in-u-s-races-ahead-11616328001,"Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers are ramping up production, churning out far more doses a week than earlier in the year, progress that is accelerating mass vaccination campaigns in the U.S.  After a slow start, Pfizer Inc., its partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. have raised output by gaining experience, scaling up production lines and taking other steps like making certain raw materials on their own.  Pfizer figured out how to stretch scarce supplies of special filters needed for the vaccine production process by recycling them. Moderna shortened the time it needed to inspect and package newly manufactured vials of its vaccine.  The companies—along with Johnson & Johnson , which recently launched a Covid-19 vaccine—also are teaming up with other firms to further increase production.  In addition, the U.S. government has helped vaccine makers access supplies under the Defense Production Act, suppliers and government officials say. The Biden administration this month said it used the act to provide $105 million in funding to help Merck & Co. make doses of J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine and to expedite materials used in its production."
12,13,https://www.wsj.com/articles/stimulus-checks-have-left-u-s-households-flush-to-spend-11616335200,"The U.S. federal government is giving a whole new meaning to the old saying “the check is in the mail.” Once meant as an assurance households gave to ward off encroaching creditors, it has instead become a regular promise of cash for households by Uncle Sam.  Last week a third round of relief payments started showing up in the accounts of millions of Americans, $1,400 payments so far sent to roughly 90 million adults totaling about $242 billion. That is on top of $600 per recipient payments sent in December and $1,200 sent earlier last year and in all will add up to more than $800 billion.  The big question for the economy: What will come of the money?  It turns out there is a lot we already know to answer that. Americans have spent some of it, saved a lot of it and used large portions to pay down burdensome debt. That leaves the economy primed for a consumer boom once business fully reopens and poses risks that worry some people on Wall Street, including higher inflation and an asset bubble. Moreover, it leaves a different debt overhang—federal debt—that poses new uncertainties for business, households and Uncle Sam himself.  “There is a lot of liquidity and desire to spend,” says Jonathan Parker, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who studies how people spend government checks. He argues the latest round of payments designed by the Biden administration should have been more targeted to those most in need."
13,14,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/28/12-defence-chiefs-condemn-myanmar-army-after-day-of-mass-murder,"Defence chiefs of 12 countries condemn Myanmar army after 114 people killed in deadliest crackdown yet on protests.  Myanmar security forces have opened fire on people gathered for the funeral of one of the 114 people killed on Saturday in the bloodiest day since the February 1 coup, as the defence chiefs of 12 countries condemned the military for its crackdown on demonstrators.  There were no immediate reports of casualties in the shooting at the funeral on Sunday in the town of Bago, near the commercial capital, Yangon, according to three people who spoke to Reuters news agency.  “While we are singing the revolution song for him, security forces just arrived and shot at us,” said a woman called Aye, who was at the service for Thae Maung Maung, a 20-year-old student who was shot on Saturday. “People, including us, run away as they opened fire.”  Two people were killed in firing on protests on Sunday in separate incidents elsewhere, witnesses and news reports said. One person was killed when troops opened fire overnight on a group of protesters near the capital Naypyidaw, Myanmar Now news reported.  So far on Sunday, there were no reports of large-scale protests in Yangon or in the country’s second city, Mandalay, which bore the brunt of the casualties on Saturday. At least six children between the ages of 10 and 16 were among those killed on Saturday, according to news reports and witnesses.  Meanwhile, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States were among the countries that signed a joint statement on Sunday denouncing the military’s crackdown.  “A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting – not harming – the people it serves,” the defence chiefs said. “We urge the Myanmar armed forces to cease violence and work to restore respect and credibility with the people of Myanmar that it has lost through its actions.”  The other signatories were Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and New Zealand.  Several funerals were held on Sunday for some of the victims of the latest crackdown on anti-coup protesters. In Mandalay, the family of Aye Ko, a father-of-four, commemorated his life at a service after he was killed overnight.  “We are told by the neighbours that Aye Ko was shot and thrown into the fire,” a relative told AFP news agency. “He was the only one who fed the family, losing him is a great loss for the family.”  The General Strike Committee of Nationalities (GSCN), one of the main protest groups, paid tribute to those who died, saying in a Facebook post: “We salute our heroes who sacrificed lives during this revolution”. It added, “We Must Win This REVOLUTION.”  Saturday, Myanmar’s Armed Forces Day, had also brought some of the heaviest fighting since the coup between the army and the ethnic armed groups that control swaths of the country.  Military jets killed at least three people in a raid on a village controlled by an armed group from the Karen minority, a civil society group said on Sunday, after the Karen National Union faction earlier said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border, killing 10 people. The air raids sent villagers fleeing into the jungle.  There was no immediate comment from the Myanmar military.  ‘Day of terror, dishonour’  The violence came as the military staged a major show of might for its annual Armed Forces Day.  Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the coup leader, said during a parade in Naypyidaw that the military would protect the people and strive for democracy. The general deposed Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, alleging fraud in a November election that returned her National League for Democracy to power.  The European Union’s delegation to Myanmar said that the 76th Myanmar Armed Forces Day “will stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour”.  “The killing of unarmed civilians, including children, are indefensible acts,” it added.

UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said it was time for the world to take action – if not through the UN Security Council, then through an international emergency summit. He said the military government should be cut off from funding, such as oil and gas revenues, and from access to weapons.  “Words of condemnation or concern are frankly ringing hollow to the people of Myanmar while the military junta commits mass murder against them,” he said in a statement. “The people of Myanmar need the world’s support. Words are not enough. It is past time for robust, coordinated action.”  ‘Impossible to express the pain’  The death toll in Myanmar has been steadily rising as authorities grow more forceful in suppressing opposition to the coup.  Up through Friday, the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, a monitoring group, said it has verified 328 deaths in the post-coup crackdown. More than 2,400 people are in detention, it said.  The Myanmar Now news portal said the 114 killed on Saturday included a 13-year-old girl in Myanmar’s second city of Mandalay and a 13-year-old boy in the central Sagaing region.  At least 40 were killed in Mandalay and at least 27 were killed in the commercial hub of Yangon, it said.  Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for New York-based Human Rights Watch, said Saturday’s events showed that the military, known in Myanmar as the Tatmadaw, should be prosecuted in international courts of law.  “This is a day of suffering and mourning for the Burmese people, who have paid for the Tatmadaw’s arrogance and greed with their lives, time and time again,” he said.  New US and European sanctions this week increased external pressure on the military. But Myanmar’s generals have enjoyed some support from Russia and China, both veto-holding members of the UN Security Council that could block any potential UN action.  Russia’s Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin attended Saturday’s military parade in Naypyidaw, having met senior military leaders a day earlier.  Diplomats said eight countries – Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, Pakistan, Russia, Thailand and Vietnam – sent representatives, but Russia was the only one to send a minister to the parade on Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of the resistance to Japanese occupation in 1945.  Dr Sasa, a spokesman for the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), an anti-coup group set up by deposed politicians, said the decision by the eight countries to attend the parade was “disgraceful” and “unacceptable”. He also urged the global community to designate Myanmar’s military as a “terrorist organisation”.  “It is impossible for us to express the pain that we feel when we saw those foreign diplomats joining hands with those celebrations of military generals. All those weapons they displayed today is to only kill the people of Myanmar,” Sasa told Al Jazeera.  “How many people need to die before the international community takes action? … If there’s no action, only words, I’m afraid my country will have to go through the greatest civil war, the likes of which we have never seen before.”"
14,15,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/28/philippines-deploys-air-force-as-fear-over-chinese-ships-mounts,"Move comes after more than 200 Chinese fishing vessels were spotted off Whitsun Reef earlier this month.  The Philippines’ air force has been conducting daily aerial patrols over Chinese fishing vessels moored near a disputed reef, the country’s defence chief said, as he repeated a call to Beijing for their withdrawal from the area.  The diplomatic row was touched off earlier this month when some 220 boats were first spotted at the boomerang-shaped Whitsun Reef, west of Palawan Island.  The Philippines ordered China to recall the vessels, describing their presence as an incursion into its sovereign territory. But China, which claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea, said the flotilla is made up of fishing vessels sheltering from bad weather.  The Philippine foreign ministry has filed a diplomatic protest, while several countries – including the United States and Australia – have expressed concern over the renewed tension in the region.  Philippine navy and coast guard ships have been deployed to the area to monitor the situation, in addition to the aerial patrols, according to the defence secretary, Delfin Lorenzana.  “We are ready to defend our national sovereignty and protect the marine resources of the Philippines,” Lorenzana said late on Saturday.  He added there will be an “increased presence” of navy and coast guard ships patrolling Philippine waters.  The resource-rich South China Sea is claimed by several countries, including the Philippines and China.  Beijing often invokes its so-called nine-dash line to justify its claimed historic rights over most of it, and has ignored a 2016 international tribunal decision that declared this assertion as without basis.  On Thursday, spokesman Harry Roque said Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte had expressed concern over the presence of the vessels to the Chinese ambassador in Manila.  Duterte is being pressed to take a stronger stand against the Chinese government in the face of a separate revelation of “significant construction activity” by China at an artificial island built on top of Subi Reef, also within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.  “The volume of changes is significant, and may indicate the early phases of major construction on Subi Reef,” according to Simularity, a US-based technology firm that studied satellite images in the South China Sea.  Duterte has fostered warmer ties with China since taking office in 2016 in exchange for greater economic cooperation with its superpower neighbour.  But the shift has failed to stem Chinese ambitions in the South China Sea, or unlock much of the billions of dollars of promised trade and loans."

Dominion could sue other media outlets following its lawsuit against Fox News, its attorney said.  Dominion claims Fox News helped spread a conspiracy theory that its machines “flipped” votes.  Tom Clare told Axios it was “a fair assumption” Dominion would sue others that spread the theory.  See more stories on Insider’s business page.  Dominion Voting Systems has already filed four defamation lawsuits, including one against Fox News, over baseless claims that its machines helped rig the 2020 US election, and one of the company’s attorneys says other media outlets could be next.  It could also sue individual Fox News employees, and the company hasn’t ruled out suing former President Donald Trump, the attorney, Tom Clare, told Axios on Monday.  As Trump contested his loss in November’s election, a conspiracy theory emerged that Dominion voting machines “flipped” votes from Trump to Joe Biden through a method developed with the regime of the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez. The theory has been thoroughly debunked.  On Friday, Dominion filed a lawsuit against Fox News, claiming the network gave prominence to the election-fraud claims as a tactic to revive its ratings. Fox News told Insider that it was “proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism, and will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court.”  Clare told Axios that other outlets “played a similar role to Fox in spreading these lies” and that it was “a fair assumption” that Dominion would sue other media outlets. He didn’t name any of them.  “We’re trying to get to the media outlets that really gave this a much bigger platform,” he said. “I expect that we’re going to be holding them accountable as well.”  He said Dominion’s lawyers were still looking into the evidence. “This is not one of those cases where we’re going to fire first and aim later,” he said.  Since January, Dominion has also filed lawsuits against the pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, Trump’s former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, accusing them of helping spread the conspiracy theory. It is seeking $US1.3 ($2) billion damages in each suit.  Dominion is seeking $US1.6 ($2) billion in its Fox News suit.  Smartmatic has also sued Fox News, naming specific hosts  Dominion’s lawsuit was just against Fox News. Its fellow voting-technology company Smartmatic, which has also been baselessly accused of “flipping” votes, named the Fox News hosts Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, and Jeanine Pirro as defendants in its lawsuit against the network.  Fox News Media, Bartiromo, Pirro, and Dobbs all filed separate motions to dismiss the lawsuit, Fox News said.  Clare said Dominion hadn’t ruled out suing individual Fox News personalities and could join these cases to the larger Fox News one or file separate cases.  He added, however, that he considered Fox News to be “the entity with the megaphone.”  Read more:  Washington moves of the week: A Michelle Obama alumna goes to HHS, the Senate gets a new top security chief, and Jen Psaki’s sister lands a new gig  Several of Fox News’ shows reported that there was no evidence of Dominion’s systems changing votes. But Fox News, in particular its opinion hosts, “questioned the results of the election or pushed conspiracy theories about it at least 774 times” in the two weeks after the network called the race, according to Media Matters. Insider has asked Fox News for comment on the Media Matters report.  When asked whether Dominion would file a suit against Trump, Clare said: “We haven’t ruled anyone out.”  He said that Dominion’s lawyers would look into the role that the president and the White House played in spreading the conspiracy theory. “If the evidence leads us to believe that we’ve got strong claims,” he said, “that’s something we’re going to look at.”  Business Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

17,18,https://www.newsweek.com/60000-sign-petition-demanding-teacher-suspended-showing-cartoon-prophet-muhammad-reinstated-1579589,"More than 60,000 have signed a petition to reinstate a teacher at the Batley Grammar School in West Yorkshire, England, that was previously suspended for showing a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad.  The petition, which was posted on Change.org, has received 63,485 signatures as of 1:46 p.m. EDT on Monday.  ""The RS Teacher was trying to educate students about racism and blasphemy. He warned the students before showing the images and he had the intent to educate them. He does not deserve such large repercussions,"" the petition's creator, who identified themself as a student of Batley Grammar School wrote in the description. ""He is not racist and did not support the Islamophobic cartoons in any manner. This has got out of hand and due to this, students have missed out on lessons because of 'peaceful' protestors.""  The release the petition's signature count comes shortly after the Batley Grammar School teacher was suspended by the school for allegedly showing a cartoon depicting Muhammad that was taken from the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, according to Yorkshire Live News.  Despite the support for the teacher's reinstatement in the petition, many have called for the teacher to remain suspended and have criticized the school for its handling of the situation. Many gathered to protest outside the school on Thursday and Friday last week, calling for the teacher to remain suspended.  Amid the protests, Batley Grammar School's headteacher Gary Kibble issued a statement on the matter.  ""The school unequivocally apologizes for using a totally inappropriate image in a recent religious studies lesson. It should not have been used. The member of the staff has also relayed their most sincere apologies,"" Kibble said. ""We have immediately withdrawn teaching on this part of the course, and we're reviewing how we go forward with the support of all our communities represented in our school.""  He continued, ""It's important for children to learn about faiths and beliefs but this must be done in a respectful and sensitive way."" Kibble also noted in his statement that there is currently an independent investigation into the matter, while the teacher remains suspended.  According to the BBC, a department of education spokesperson also issued a statement on the matter, saying, ""It is never acceptable to threaten or intimidate teachers.""  ""However, the nature of protest we have seen, including issuing threats and in violation of coronavirus restrictions, are completely unacceptable and must be brought to an end,"" the statement said according to BBC. ""Schools are free to include a full range of issues, ideas and materials in their curriculum, including where they are challenging or controversial, subject to their obligations to ensure political balance.""  Newsweek reached out to Batley Grammar School for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication."
18,19,https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/amazon-rainforest-now-emits-more-greenhouse-gases-it-absorbs-180977347/,"The Amazon rainforest may now emit more greenhouse gases than the famously lush ecosystem absorbs, according to new research.  Long considered to be a bulwark against climate change because of its capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, a new study suggests rising temperatures, increasing drought and rampant deforestation have likely overwhelmed the Amazon’s ability to absorb more greenhouse gases than it emits, reports Craig Welch for National Geographic.  The sobering findings appear in a new study published earlier this month in the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change that calculates, for the first time, the net emissions of greenhouse gases from both human and natural sources in the Amazon Basin, reports Liz Kimbrough for Mongabay.  A key distinction in appreciating the study’s findings is that they do not just concern carbon dioxide, according to Mongabay. Though carbon dioxide often gets top billing in discussions around climate change, there are many other significant greenhouse gases, including methane, nitrous oxide, aerosols and sooty black carbon.  So, while the Amazon still absorbs and stores a prodigious amount of carbon, its net greenhouse gas emissions have tipped from negative to positive—not just because its capacity to absorb carbon dioxide has been damaged by human activity, but also because the transforming landscape has increased emissions of these other greenhouse gases.  “If you’re only looking at the carbon picture, you’re missing a big part of the story,” Kristofer Covey, an environmental scientist at Skidmore College and the study’s lead author, tells the New Republic’s Melody Schreiber. “We need to start understanding the full complexity of this ecosystem. We’re down there tinkering at a massive scale, and we don’t really understand the full implications of what we’re doing.”  For example, the dried-out wetlands and compacted soils that result from extensive logging often increase nitrous oxide emissions, and fires used to clear land for livestock and agriculture release particles of soot called black carbon that absorb sunlight and cause localized warming, according to National Geographic.  “Cutting the forest is interfering with its carbon uptake; that’s a problem,” Covey tells National Geographic. “When you start to look at these other factors alongside CO2, it gets really hard to see how the net effect isn’t that the Amazon as a whole is really warming global climate.”  Part of the issue is that many of the ways in which human activities are changing the Amazon end up being double or even triple whammies when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. Say cattle ranchers burn a patch of rainforest to create new pasture for their herd, not only is the carbon dioxide absorbing power of the trees gone, but their stored carbon is released and the newly barren soil is likely to increase its emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. What’s more, the grazing cows belch methane, a greenhouse gas roughly 30-times more damaging than carbon dioxide. Lost forest cover can also change patterns of rainfall and make the rest of the forest hotter and drier, which also tends to increase greenhouse gas emissions.  Overall, the pattern starts to sound like a worrisome feedback loop: deforestation increases greenhouse gas emissions which increases warming, and that warming then drives increased greenhouse gas emissions, and so on.  Though it may be a cold comfort, the study authors hasten to point out that as dire as their study’s findings sound, the entire enterprise of trying to calculate the Amazon's net impact on global climate is incredibly complex.  “Parsing the complex interactions between the Amazon, its effects on climate, and human influences is a bit like trying to predict the stock market,” Fiona Soper, an ecologist at McGill University in Canada and co-author of the study, tells Mongabay. “[I]t’s made up of moving parts: multiple climate forcers, not just carbon but also methane, nitrous oxide, particulates and biophysical effects, each being acted on by human stressors that range from dam building and hunting to climate change…Synthesizing these changes is a huge challenge.”  Speaking with National Geographic, Covey says it’s not too late to reverse the damage done to this natural treasure by ceasing deforestation and curbing the global use of fossil fuels.  But the time to take decisive actions necessary to restore the Amazon to its former glory may be limited. A 2018 analysis from a pair of leading researchers suggests the rainforest may be dangerously close to an ecological tipping point. If 20 to 25 percent of the Amazon is lost to deforestation that huge swaths of the rainforest may flip from rainforests to comparatively barren savanna, according to the 2018 study. To date, deforestation has claimed an estimated 17 percent of the Amazon.  Despite all this destruction, the Amazon’s stretches of intact rainforest remain essential and hugely beneficial to surrounding communities and the world, Soper tells Mongabay. “The main take away from this work,” she says, “should be a call to arms to prevent further degradation of the Amazon system.”"
19,20,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-economists-idUSKBN2BM0A1,"(Reuters) - A growing number of climate economists say the world should take “immediate and drastic action” to tackle climate change, according to a survey published Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Failing to do so could cost the world some $1.7 trillion a year by the middle of this decade, escalating to about $30 trillion a year by 2075, according to estimations by the 738 economists from around the world surveyed by New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity.  “People joke about how economists can’t agree on most things,” said Derek Sylvan, the institute’s strategy director and one of the authors of the survey. “But we seem to find a pretty strong level of consensus” on the economic importance of climate action.  Three-quarters of respondents strongly agreed that drastic action should be taken immediately, compared with just half of economists polled by the same institute in 2015.  For another question on reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, two-thirds said the costs of investing toward that global goal would be outweighed by the economic benefits, which would include preventing natural disasters, preserving coastal infrastructure and assets and protecting food supplies.  To avoid catastrophic climate change, scientists say the world needs to reach net-zero emission by 2050 -- meaning people are adding no more emissions to the atmosphere than they are removing.  Sylvan said he was surprised that so many saw net-zero action as “economically desirable, even on the pretty short timeline that we’re talking about.”  Most of the international climate economists questioned for the survey in February said they had become more concerned about climate change over the last five years. The most common reason they gave was the escalation in recent extreme weather events, which have included climate-linked wildfires and heat waves.  The world saw more than 7,300 major natural disasters between 2000 and 2019, which killed some 1.2 million and cost $3 trillion in damages, according to the U.N. Office on Disaster Risk Reduction. That compares with about 4,200 disasters, leading to 1.19 million killed and $1.6 trillion in losses during the 20 years previous, the data show.  “Some places are more exposed, and current levels of income matter a great deal,” said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago and the director of the Energy Policy Institute at Chicago.  The fallout from climate change will impact people and nations  Economic disparities make it hard to apply simple cost-benefit analyses, he said. For example, a poor family will feel economic losses more acutely than a wealthy family.  “How do we think about a dollar of climate damage to (billionaires) Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos versus a family of four living below the poverty line? I think as a society we have to make a judgment about that.”"

Appearing on CNN Wednesday night, McCabe claimed federal officials did not open investigations into sitting members of Congress without ""a significant degree of information,"" and called news of the probe into Gaetz ""substantial.""  The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the Department of Justice was investigating whether the GOP lawmaker had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paid for her to travel with him, citing unnamed sources.  However, the congressman has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and alleges that the claims are part of a $25 million extortion plot targeting both him and his family. He added that his father had worn a wire at the FBI's direction to catch criminals trying to extort him.  Speaking to CNN last night, McCabe said: ""It's substantial and very serious. You know [after] 21 years of opening and overseeing, conducting investigations, I can tell you that nobody opens a sex trafficking investigation in which the subject is a sitting member of Congress without having a significant degree of information.""  ""In any case, I can assure you the FBI doesn't open these cases lightly, and don't get briefed to the attorney general without some significant momentum behind them,"" he later added.  At the time of writing, the ex-FBI official's speculative remarks are not borne out by published evidence, and he left the Bureau in early 2018 after being fired under the Trump administration.  It was reported that the probe into Gaetz was opened during the final months of the Trump administration when William Barr was serving as attorney general. The congressman does not face any charges at present.  Releasing a statement on Tuesday, he said: ""Over the past several weeks, my family and I have been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million while threatening to smear my name.  ""We have been cooperating with federal authorities in this matter and my father has even been wearing a wire at the FBI's direction to catch these criminals.""  He also demanded that the Justice Department release tapes his father made while wearing a wire immediately, claiming that the recordings implicated a former staffer of the department. Newsweek contacted Congressman Gaetz's office for further comment.  In a statement provided on Tuesday, Gaetz said: ""No part of the allegations against me are true, and the people pushing these lies are targets of the ongoing extortion investigation."""

The judge ruled that the NDA was too vaguely worded to be legally enforceable.  The ruling was in a case brought by Jessica Denson, the 2016 campaign's Hispanic outreach director.  See more stories on Insider's business page.  A federal judge on Tuesday overturned a nondisclosure agreement signed by members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.  US District Judge Paul Gardephe ruled that the language in the agreement, which all members of the 2016 campaign were required to sign, was so vague that it was not enforceable under the law, Politico reported.  Gardephe's ruling said the provision was ""much broader than what the Campaign asserts is necessary to protect its legitimate interests, and therefore is not reasonable.""  ""The non-disclosure provision's vague, overbroad, and undefined terms also render it unduly burdensome,"" the ruling said.  The ruling said it was ""difficult if not impossible"" for campaign employees ""to know whether any speech might be covered by one of the broad categories of restricted information"" or ""whether that speech might relate to one of the several hundred potential subjects of the non-disclosure provision.""  The ruling came in a case brought by Jessica Denson, who was the campaign's Hispanic outreach director. She argued that the nondisclosure agreement violated her First Amendment rights by preventing her from criticizing Trump ""forever,"" Insider's Oma Seddiq reported.  Denson had separately filed a lawsuit against the campaign in 2017 alleging sexual harassment and discrimination. She was ordered to pay $50,000 to the campaign, which had argued that she violated the NDA. She then filed the NDA class-action lawsuit.  A motion for summary judgment in the NDA case filed in July on behalf of Denson and other campaign staffers said the agreement, which has a nondisparagement clause, was ""plainly conceived"" as a ""tool to silence critics of the President, and it has repeatedly been used to that end.""  Denson told Politico she believed that the NDAs, which Trump has long used to silence employees and critics, had stopped many former campaign staffers from speaking out.  ""Just the terms of the NDA were wildly restricting and it completely stifled public debate, truthful public debate about the Trump campaign and presidency, so this is a massive victory,"" she said.  ""NDAs like this are part of the reason why we ended up with a Donald Trump candidacy and presidency in the first place."""
23,24,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/us/michigan-covid-outbreak.html,"“March and April last year, I don’t think I slept for two months,” Mr. Duggan said. “It was just traumatic. People I knew were dying. We had people dying on gurneys.”  Dr. Joneigh S. Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive, said on Tuesday that 50 percent of state residents over 65 were fully vaccinated, a sign of progress that the most vulnerable population is closer to protection from Covid-19.  But she said the most significant increase in hospitalizations in the state is in people in their 50s, a group still at risk of becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19. Younger people have driven the rapid increase in cases recently, she said, including high school students who participate in sports and have contracted the virus through those activities.  “I do think this could be the beginning of a third surge,” Dr. Khaldun said, after an initial rush of cases in Michigan last March and April, followed by a surge in October and November. “I am concerned. But I also think there are things that we can do today that will start to turn that curve down.”  In Detroit, Michigan’s largest city, local leaders have poured their efforts into a drive to vaccinate residents and try to outrun the virus.  The challenges are deep. Some of the same characteristics of Detroit that allowed the virus to spread also make it difficult to administer the vaccine. The city is geographically spread out across 139 square miles, many Detroiters depend on the bus system to get around, and a round trip downtown for a vaccine can take hours.  The city has offered $2 rides downtown for residents headed to mass vaccination sites, which are inoculating thousands of people each day, and this week opened eligibility to anyone who is at least 16 years old."
24,25,https://abcnews.go.com/US/derek-chauvin-trial-exposes-trauma-survivors-guilt-witnesses/story?id=76809771&cid=clicksource_4380645_3_heads_hero_live_hero_hed,"The opening days of Derek Chauvin's murder trial have included gripping testimony and evidence -- whether it's been reliving the moments that led to George Floyd's death, seen through body camera video of responding officers, or the emotional retelling of events by witnesses.  But one of the most striking themes emerging from the trial is the emotional trauma and survivor's guilt expressed by eyewitnesses, many of whom were standing mere feet away from Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd's neck and as Floyd took his last labored breaths.  Charles McMillian, 61, broke down in the courtroom on Wednesday as he watched police bodycam footage of the incident that he'd seen in person. A teen witness told prosecutors that she's still kept up at night by the fact that she wasn't able to save Floyd's life. Christopher Martin, 19, said he regrets telling his manager about the counterfeit $20 bill that led to Floyd's encounter with Minneapolis police and subsequent death.  ""If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided,"" he told the jury.  Seeing the death or severe injury of another person in such close proximity could trigger post-traumatic stress disorder for these witnesses, according to Dr. Ziv Cohen, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Cornell University. As they relive these potentially traumatizing moments in the courtroom, Cohen said it's important that witnesses ""think about how they've been doing all this time since George Floyd's death.""  Symptoms of PTSD can come in many different forms, including depression, emotional numbing, hyper-vigilance or intrusive memories and flashbacks of the traumatizing incident.  People with PTSD may be more fearful when navigating the same neighborhoods, Cohen said, or encountering people who were involved in the event. They may also begin to avoid things or places that prompt distressing memories. However, people with this disorder don't always experience all of these symptoms.  Witnesses recalled feelings of hopelessness and desperation as they watched Chauvin kneel on Floyd's neck until he lost consciousness. The incident occurred after Floyd presented cashiers with a fake $20 bill at a grocery store. Police bodycam footage shows witnesses, who also were recording the incident themselves, pleading with officers to get off of Floyd's neck and get him medical attention.  I would have been able to provide medical attention to the best of my abilities, and this human was denied that right.  ""I think if there's a heavy aspect of injustice, that makes it much harder to process the trauma in a healthy way,"" Cohen told ABC News. ""If you're in a situation like you're really feeling helpless and there's a sense of injustice -- like, this is a human-caused tragedy and that there is no redress and it's fundamentally unfair and that you're helpless, I do think that adds a whole other dimension to the trauma.""  A viral video of Floyd's death prompted anti-police brutality and anti-racism protests across the country -- and then across the globe.  Teenage high school student Darnella was behind the viral video of Floyd's arrest. She was 17 at the time, and has since told prosecutors she still feels shaken by his death.  ""I have a Black father,"" she told prosecutors. ""I have a Black brother, I have Black friends. And I look at that and I look at how that could have been one of them. I stayed up [at night] apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting, not saving his life.""  Darnella was accompanying her 9-year-old cousin to the grocery store when they saw police confronting Floyd. The 9-year-old also was put on the stand by prosecutors to testify.  ""I was sad and kind of mad,"" the young girl said. ""Because it felt like [Chauvin] was stopping his breathing, and it was kind of, like, hurting him.""  When children of color view traumatic incidences of death involving someone of the same racial or ethnic background, according to Cohen, it could damage their ""perception of themselves, their identity, their sense of security, their sense of whether the world is fundamentally a friendly and safe place whether authority can be trusted.""  The testimonies revealed the lingering effects Floyd's death on each witness.  Another bystander, Donald Williams II, wiped away tears as he listened to a 911 call he made to police to report Chauvin and the other officers who held Floyd in what Williams called a blood choke hold.  ""I believe I witnessed a murder,"" Williams said. He recalled seeing Floyd struggle for air and watching his life ""slowly fade away.""  Minneapolis firefighter Genevieve Hansen broke down in tears after she recalled begging officers to let her give Floyd medical attention at the scene.  ""There was a man being killed,"" Hansen said. ""I would have been able to provide medical attention to the best of my abilities, and this human was denied that right.""  When prosecutors asked McMillian how he felt while watching Floyd get arrested on that day in May 2020, he tearfully explained, ""I feel helpless.""  Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill called for a 10-minute recess so McMillian could gather himself.  Martin, a Cup Foods store clerk, expressed guilt and regret for reporting the counterfeit $20 bill to the store manager. His boss told Martin to confront Floyd, and when Floyd refused to come back into the store, a coworker was instructed to call the police. When he asked what was going through his mind during Floyd's arrest, he responded ""disbelief and guilt.""  He seemed to partially blame himself for Floyd's death.  ""If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided,"" Martin said.  Alyssa, another witness, also was 17 the day Floyd died. She cried on the witness stand as she re-watched video footage of Floyd's arrest.  ""I was powerless there,"" she said. ""I felt like I was failing him.""  Though not everyone who witnessed Floyd's arrest may be experiencing PTSD or relates symptoms, the disturbing images of the event can still affect their mental health, especially as they revisit and explore traumatic memories, Cohen noted.  ""This has maybe affected the arc of their life,"" Cohen added.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city won't open the vaccine to everyone 16 and older along with the rest of the state in two weeks due to a ""quantum leap"" in coronavirus cases.  Gov. JB Pritzker announced that anyone 16 and older could get the crucial shot starting April 12, following many other states in expanding vaccine eligibility.  ""We have over 400, almost 500 cases, on average as of today. That's a quantum leap from where we were even three weeks ago,"" Lightfoot said at a press conference on Wednesday.  On Thursday, Chicago reported a seven-day rolling average of 519 daily COVID-19 infections, up 41% from the 367 reported a week earlier, according to city data. At the start of the month, the city reported an average of 295 daily cases. Chicago now has a seven-day rolling average positivity rate of 4.6%, up from 3.4% last week.  Lightfoot noted that the uptick in cases emerged primarily on the North Side of the city in neighborhoods like Old Town, Lakeview, Lincoln Park and Portage Park, especially among 18-to-39-year-olds.  ""We're not going to see anything more significant in the reopening front until we see those numbers stabilize and start to come down,"" Lightfoot said.  She blamed the spike in infections on young people resuming life as normal as the warm weather moves in. She tweeted Tuesday, ""Folks, the pandemic is not over. Warmer weather is not an excuse to make reckless decisions.""  The governor disagreed with Lightfoot's decision.  ""I'm concerned, I will be honest with you, that the city of Chicago seems to want to delay beyond April 12,"" he said, speaking at an unrelated press conference on Wednesday. ""We should be getting every dose into every arm that we possibly can.""  On Monday, Chicago entered Phase 1C, which opened eligibility to anyone 16 and older with qualifying medical conditions, plus more types of essential workers -- food and beverage employees, media members and clergy among them.  As of Thursday, 14.4% of the entire Chicago population has been fully vaccinated, according to city data.  Pritzker and Lightfoot have sparred over COVID-19 guidelines and the handling of the pandemic over the past year.  In October, the two officials, the state's most powerful Democrats, clashed when Pritzker ordered for a ban on indoor dining and bar service in the city, citing an uptick in COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions. Lightfoot argued those businesses needed to stay open to support the economy.  In March of 2020, the two also disagreed over closing public schools. Pritzker ordered all state schools to shutter on March 13, overruling Lightfoot, who expressed concern over keeping kids safe and making sure they had enough to eat.  Lightfoot has demanded more doses be be sent to the city before she opens up eligibility.  Officials announced on Tuesday that Chicago will open two additional mass vaccination sites on Monday -- one at a conference center next to Wrigley Field and the other at Chicago State University."

On the one hand, it takes about one-third fewer workers to build an electric car than a car with an internal combustion engine. On the other, the plan could make Detroit more competitive and increase its share of the global automobile market.  Mr. Biden’s proposed solution is to lure the electric-battery industry, and its supply chain, to the United States from China and elsewhere in Asia, with a mix of manufacturing tax credits and other incentives. If it works, the next two years would see new electric vehicle battery and assembly plants sprouting up across the country. If it fails, Mr. Biden could face harsh political repercussions.  “We can make it work, but we have to be intentional about policy to bring the battery supply chain back to the U.S.,” said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat whose Detroit-area district is home to some of the nation’s largest auto plants. She added, “If they’re in China and Asia, this isn’t going to be OK.”  Some industry analysts say as Americans buy more electric vehicles, battery manufacturers will build plants in the United States. That would make it easier to integrate the batteries into cars and helps save on transportation costs.  But even with new plants, much of the work can happen outside of the United States. According to a recent report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and BloombergNEF, an energy research group, only 46 percent of the value of a Tesla battery assembled in the United States comes from this country. The rest comes from Japan and China.  Mr. Biden’s energy plan would also dedicate $100 billion to update and modernize the electricity grid to make it more reliable and better able to route power from wind and solar plants to large cities. Mr. Biden would also extend tax credits that subsidize investments in wind and solar energy.  Accelerating the shift to wind and solar power is likely to create tens of thousands of construction jobs, economists and industry officials say. But those jobs typically pay far less than those in the fossil fuel industry."

""I'm going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office; listen to them, what they have to say; and be open to other ideas,"" Biden said in a speech Wednesday. ""We'll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done.""  Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas.), the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, quickly rejected Biden's Oval Office invite as ""disingenuous.""  As the Washington Post reported, Biden ""phoned McConnell on Tuesday to brief him on the details before the White House unveiled the infrastructure plan."" A day later, McConnell dismissed the proposal as a ""Trojan horse for far-left demands.""  With the GOP leaving little doubt about its plans to stand in the way of a package whose broad outlines are extremely popular with the American public—including 50% of self-identified Republicans—progressives are urging the Biden administration and congressional Democrats to go it alone, either by using budget reconciliation or eliminating the Senate filibuster.  ""We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in our infrastructure, climate, communities, and people,"" Jayapal said Thursday. ""Now is the time to go big."""

Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican being investigated by the Justice Department over sex trafficking allegations, made a name for himself when he arrived on Capitol Hill as a conservative firebrand on TV and staunch defender of then-President Donald Trump. Behind the scenes, Gaetz gained a reputation in Congress over his relationships with women and bragging about his sexual escapades to his colleagues, multiple sources told CNN.  Gaetz allegedly showed off to other lawmakers photos and videos of nude women he said he had slept with, the sources told CNN, including while on the House floor. The sources, including two people directly shown the material, said Gaetz displayed the images of women on his phone and talked about having sex with them. One of the videos showed a naked woman with a hula hoop, according to one source.  ""It was a point of pride,"" one of the sources said of Gaetz.  There's no indication these pictures are connected to the DOJ investigation.  Gaetz, 38, who was elected to Congress in 2016, has been at the center of a number of controversies in his four-plus years in Congress. But he's now embroiled in easily his biggest scandal yet, after the Justice Department began investigating him in the final months of the Trump administration under then-Attorney General William Barr as part of a larger investigation into another Florida politician. Federal investigators are examining whether Gaetz engaged in a relationship with a woman that began when she was 17 years old and whether his involvement with other young women broke federal sex trafficking and prostitution laws, two people briefed on the matter said."
29,30,https://www.leafie.co.uk/news/decriminalise-cannabis-government-report-recommends/,"Yesterday the government published its review into racial equality, entitled Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, with the view to helping society become more racially equal. The report was ordered by the government last year after a turbulent summer of race protests, often involving the BLM movement, and stated that it wanted to tackle the “disproportionate criminalisation of young people, often from ethnic minority and deprived backgrounds, through their personal use of cannabis and other soft drugs”.  The main recommendation the report makes in regards to drug possession, and specifically Class B drugs including cannabis, was for diversion schemes to be put in place to prevent young people from falling into the Criminal Justice system for minor drug crimes. These schemes would offer those caught with small amounts of Class B drugs to be automatically considered for a drugs referral program instead of being prosecuted as a criminal. This is intended to help young people by providing them with any assistance they may need to tackle substance abuse, but also enables them to pursue a future in education and employment without being held back by a criminal record.  The report states: “The Commission wants to urgently address the disproportionate number of ethnic minority young people going into the criminal justice system as a result of low-level Class B drug possession. The Commission is not advocating or endorsing the legalisation of Class B drugs, however, it points to examples such as the Thames Valley and West Midlands Police drug diversion models to keep these young people away from gaining a criminal record, while trying to address the root cause of their drug use.”  An anonymous 17 year-old male who was featured in the report gave this remark after being referred to the diversion scheme by Thames Valley Police: “I did the drug diversion sessions when I was stopped by the police in the wrong place at the wrong time with a joint of cannabis on me. […] But I actually found the sessions to be really useful and I learnt a lot from them.[…] I think it’s really important that Thames Valley Police offer this so that we don’t just get a criminal record.”  The diversion scheme was recommended by the commission to four of the six police force areas that have the highest number of drug-related arrests in the country, the Met, Merseyside, West Yorkshire and Humberside. The two other forces with the highest drug-related arrests, West Midlands and Thames Valley Police, are among several other forces trialling a similar scheme of defacto cannabis decriminalisation.  The suggested scheme will be open to offenders who admit guilt for their offence, and who agree to have the substances destroyed. However, the report notes that it heard views from people in ethnic communities about this, and concluded that the requirement to accept guilt is likely to act as a potential barrier to a diversion. This, they say, is reflected in the youth justice system, where between 2017 and 2019, Black, Asian and mixed ethnicity children were substantially less likely than white children to receive an out of court disposal.  Cannabis was used regularly by more than 2.6 million people in the UK last year, with an estimated market value of approximately £2 billion. Within the 16 to 24 year-old age group, cannabis was the most used substance, with 18.7% of them reporting cannabis use in the last twelve months. Cannabis was also the most commonly seized drug by the police in the year ending March 2020, representing 74% of all drug seizures and amounting to about 125,000 seizures.  In 2019, 63% of convictions for drug offences were for White offenders, 20% for Black offenders and 10% for Asian offenders, yet Black people are 9 times more like to be subjected to stop and search. These tactics have been a contentious issue for race campaigners for years as police are seen to be disproportionately targeting people from ethnic backgrounds."

DeWine said despite young people having a lower rate of falling ill with COVID-19, evidence shows they are “significant carriers” due to increased interactions associated with college life.  “That age group interacts more — more socialization, more movement, more contacts,” DeWine said. “It is a strategic move, frankly, to vaccinate them on campus before they get out in early May for the summer and scatter throughout the state and throughout the country.”  DeWine said having vaccination clinics on campuses will also help increase the portion of college students who choose to receive the vaccine.  “We believe that more of the college students will opt to get the vaccine if they can get it right there and they can get it at the same time as their peers,” DeWine said.

36,37,https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/04/02/despite-declining-us-pesticide-use-toxicity-bees-doubled-decade-study,"Despite lower applied amounts of pesticides in U.S. agriculture, their toxicity to non-target species including honeybees more than doubled in a decade, according to a new study.  The findings by a team of researchers from Germany's University Koblenz-Landau were published Friday in the journal Science.  ""We have taken a large body of pesticide use data from the U.S. and have expressed changes of amounts applied in agriculture over time as changes in total applied pesticide toxicity,"" explained lead author Ralf Schulz, professor for environmental sciences in Landau, in a statement.  ""This provides a new view on the potential consequences that pesticide use in agriculture has on biodiversity and ecosystems,"" he said.  The researchers looked at changes in the use of 381 pesticides from 1992 to 2016 and analyzed toxicity impacts on eight non-target species groups, drawing data from the U.S. Geological Survey and Environmental Protection Agency. They used the EPA's threshold values to determine ""total applied pesticide toxicity.""  Lower amounts of pesticides have been applied, which brought decreased impacts on vertebrates, the scientists noted. But the same can't be said for for non-target species including aquatic invertebrates like crustaceans and pollinators like bees, who faced a doubling in toxicity between 2005 and 2015—a shift the authors put on increases in the use of pesticides called pyrethroids and neonicotinoids.  Also troubling is that an increase in herbicide toxicity has been on the rise as well, the scientists said, with the biggest impact seen on terrestrial plants. The study pointed to increased toxicity in the widely cultivated genetically modified crops in the U.S. of corn and soybean.  Schulz said the findings ""challenge the claims of decreasing environmental impact of chemical pesticides in both conventional and GM crops and call for action to reduce the pesticide toxicity applied in agriculture worldwide.""  The study was released amid continued concerns, both nationally and international, about wide-ranging adverse ecological impacts of neonicotinoids, or neonics, as they're sometimes called, especially amid a global decline in insect numbers that threatens humanity's future.  As Philip Donkersley, a senior research associate in entomology at Lancaster University, wrote this month at The Conversation:  Since their introduction in the late 1980s, robust scientific evidence has emerged to suggest these chemicals impair learning and memory, foraging behavior, and pollination in bees. The E.U. banned neonicotinoids in 2019, and while the U.K. government pledged to follow suit, it granted a special exemption for sugar beet farmers to use the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam in January 2021. Thankfully, it wasn't used. Because honeybees don't spend much time on the ground, environmental risk assessments for neonicotinoids often neglect to consider how exposure to these chemicals in the soil affects all pollinators. But in a landmark study published in Nature, researchers have shown how neonicotinoids affect bees not just by accumulating in the plants pollinators visit, but in the ground where most wild bees build their nests.  Evidence suggests neonics' impacts go well beyond bees, including possibly to mammals like deer who inadvertently consume them.  As Civil Eats reported last month, the concerns are prompting continued demands for U.S. regulators to take action to curb or ban use of neonics.  Daniel Raichel, a staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told the outlet: ""It's a bee issue for sure, but really, it's an ecosystem issue. It's an everything issue."""

Bernie Sanders on Thursday called on President Joe Biden to immediately order a shutdown of the Dakota Access pipeline as it undergoes a court-ordered environmental impact review.  ""In 2016, we witnessed egregious environmental racism as North Dakota law enforcement officials violently removed protestors from the path of DAPL, many of them from the nearby Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.""  —Letter  In January, a federal appeals court upheld a district judge's order for a more extensive environmental assessment of the crude oil project—but reversed the part of the judge's ruling that would have required a pause in pipeline operations during the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' review.  Following the January ruling, a group of five Democratic lawmakers led by Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-Calif.) sent a letter imploring Biden to step in and immediately shut down the pipeline, whose ownership group includes Energy Transfer, Phillips 66, and Enbridge. On Thursday, 28 lawmakers from the House and Senate joined the pressure campaign as Indigenous youth rallied in support of the DAPL shutdown call near the White House.

President Biden is the latest American leader to invoke China’s accomplishments while pressing Congress to allocate spending for a far-reaching infrastructure program. He says more than $2 trillion to fix bridges and mass transit, modernize airports and refurbish neighborhoods, extend broadband internet coverage and replace lead piping is the cost to “outcompete China.”  Sleek airports, grand stadiums and stylized skylines captivate visitors to China. Infrastructure may be the most tangible—and admired—aspect of a modernization drive that in a generation transformed a poor country into the U.S.’s primary strategic and economic rival.  Donald Trump also entered the presidency highlighting China and pledging to rebuild America. “They have bridges that are so incredible,” Mr. Trump said at a 2016 rally.  “There’s a real China envy,” says Thomas J. Campanella, a historian who specializes in urban planning at Cornell University who used to live in eastern China. “The Chinese seem to be able to do this stuff we used to do.”"

The EU is moving ahead with plans to roll out a “Digital Green Certificate”—a document to store Covid-19 information such as vaccination records and test results. Governments, airports and airlines hope that will spur travel across the bloc by making it easier to check if passengers have been inoculated.  “Vaccines are what is going to ultimately allow us to start recovering as an industry,” said Olivier Jankovec, director general of Airports Council International Europe, a trade body of airports. “It’s what is going to allow Europeans to be mobile again.”  On Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people who are fully vaccinated against the new coronavirus can travel without serious risk, easing its blanket advice against travel.  The EU plan is still in flux, but governments are fast-tracking the project for a mid-June rollout. The basic concept: Europeans who are vaccinated will be issued a certificate, either paper or electronic, with a bar code that can be scanned at airports to verify vaccination."

NASA hopes its spindly robot copter, named Ingenuity, will prove that powered flight is possible in the perilously thin Martian air and help usher in a new era of planetary exploration in which drones play a vital role.  Ingenuity reached Mars like a stowaway, folded up on the underside of NASA’s Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February after a seven-month, 293-million-mile voyage from Earth. For its maiden flight, the 4-pound, $85 million craft will simply rise about 10 feet above the surface and hover—no higher than the rim of a regulation basketball hoop—before returning to the surface. The whole flight should be over within 90 seconds.  The brief excursion—one of five planned for a one-month period expected to start on or about April 11—is a short hop by the measures of interplanetary travel. But agency officials said it would be a giant leap for Mars exploration. In the future, they said, autonomous drones like Ingenuity could take to the skies to explore canyons, ice caps and other terrain that is inaccessible to rovers. Should human explorers ever land on Mars, drones could serve as scouts and aerial sensors.  “We are hoping that Ingenuity allows us to expand and open up aerial mobility on Mars,” said Bob Balaram, the project’s chief engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.  The flight of Ingenuity, part of a broader mission to seek signs of past life on the red planet, is the latest in a flurry of notable Mars moments this year."

Police shot and killed the suspect in the incident, who police said had a knife. Another injured officer was in stable condition Friday evening, according to the police.  The incident rattled Washington and immediately raised new questions about security at the Capitol complex, which was stepped up in the wake of the assault by a pro-Trump mob in January that caused the deaths of five people. Most lawmakers are out of town because of a congressional recess, and people inside the Capitol were placed under lockdown for nearly two hours in the wake of the attack.  Capitol Police acting chief Yogananda Pittman said the suspect rammed his car into two officers and then hit a barrier at an access point off Constitution Avenue, on the Senate side of the building. She said he then exited the vehicle with a knife and lunged toward the officers. At least one officer fired upon the suspect at that point, police said. Both injured officers and the suspect were transported to local hospitals, the police said.  The police identified the deceased officer as William ‘Billy’ Evans, who police said had served as a member of the force since 2003. Officials declined to speculate on the suspect’s motive. Robert Contee, acting chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, told reporters the attack didn’t appear to be terrorism-related, but law enforcement will continue to investigate."

The All-Star Game patch that appeared on the right sleeve of the Braves' jerseys during opening day was sewn over Saturday against Philadelphia at Citizens Bank Park. The same logo was gone from their hats, too.  The uniform change came a day after Major League Baseball announced that this summer's All-Star Game was being moved out of Atlanta over the sport's objections to sweeping changes to Georgia voting laws.  It was easy to spot the change on the jersey, with the outline of the All-Star patch hastily covered over. The Braves still have a patch on their left sleeves marking the 150th anniversary of the franchise.  The summer event had been scheduled for July 13 at Truist Park in Atlanta.  “I’m disappointed that it’s not going to being there,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said before a 4-0 loss to Philadelphia. “But I’m focused on playing baseball and what we’ve got going on this season. Other than being disappointed, that’s all I have to say on it.”  Said Atlanta pitcher Charlie Morton, in his 14th season big league season: “It’s about more than just the guys in the clubhouse. It’s about the city of Atlanta, the state of Georgia, the Braves organization, people coming in from all over the country and the businesses in the area seeing a boost.”  “I’m disappointed for the Braves organization and those who are local who would have benefitted seeing the influx of business and excitement in the area. It’s a bad situation. Some of the guys who are likely to be on the team, it would have been nice to represent the team in their home park. People would have been able to see what was done in the ballpark,"" he said.  “Other than that, I don’t know what to say about it. It just stinks,” he said.  A new site for the game hasn’t been announced.  MLB said the All-Star Game festivities will still feature a planned tribute to late Braves Hall of Famer Hank Aaron, a civil rights hero. Houston manager Dusty Baker, who played with Aaron in Atlanta, and several others have suggested the event be held in Milwaukee — Aaron began his career with the Milwaukee Braves and finished with the Milwaukee Brewers.  “I think Major League Baseball made a good decision,"" said Brewers manager Craig Counsell, who added he'd like to see the game held in Milwaukee.  “Absolutely. I think it would be a thrill for the city, for sure,” he said. ""It’s not a good thing for the city of Atlanta and some people who have lost some economic opportunities, but if it’s going to be somewhere else, it would be a thrill for the city to have it here.”  Commissioner Rob Manfred made the decision to move the All-Star Game and events, along with the amateur draft, from Atlanta after discussions with individual big leaguers and the Players Alliance, an organization of Black players formed after the death of George Floyd last year.  “This all came together rather quickly,"" said Chicago Cubs outfielder Jason Heyward, who is Black. ""We had, I think, a day left in spring training. The Players Alliance, we gathered and got as many people as we could on a call. It was probably less than 50 guys on there out of the 100 or whatever. We had our conversation.  “We knew how we felt about it. We wanted to make sure, I think, that regardless of what happened, the decision was made, that we were there to do what we could in Atlanta,” he said.  Heyward, who grew up in the Atlanta area and was the Braves' first-round draft pick in 2007, said ""it was nice to see someone make a move pretty quickly and try to do it in a positive light, knowing it’s still a tough decision.”  “I think you’re not going to be able to please everybody. I know there’s a lot of people in Atlanta that love baseball and were looking forward to see an All-Star Game there. A Midsummer Classic, I think that’s special, as somebody growing up there and watching a lot of baseball,” he said. “But at the same time, I think when you talk about a message, the people are still out here pushing for equality.”  ———  More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP—Sports"

""The Office of Congressman Matt Gaetz and Luke Ball have agreed that it would be best to part ways.

The Hill newspaper reported Friday afternoon that Gaetz said he has no plans to step down.  Gaetz said in a text exchange with the paper that rumors he plans to resign are ""false"" and that it is ""very safe"" to say he doesn't have any intention to do so, The Hill reported.  Gaetz's associate, former local politician Joel Greenberg, was indicted last year for allegedly trafficking a teenage girl for sex in 2017, and the Justice Department is also trying to determine whether Gaetz had sex with the 17-year-old, according to sources. Greenberg pleaded not guilty to the charges.  A lawyer for Greenberg did not respond to ABC News' request for comment Thursday.  Gaetz's office did not respond to a request for comment Thursday night, but earlier this week Gaetz insisted on Fox News that he never ""had a relationship with a 17-year-old,"" calling such allegations ""totally false.""

That was $21,000 above the asking price and 37% more than the seller had paid for the ranch-style home only two years ago.  Accepting the offer was the easy part. Ms. White then had to call 17 other agents who had scheduled tours of the house to let them know it was off the market.

Now, they are finally showing signs of fatigue.  Trading activity among nonprofessional investors has slowed in recent weeks after a blockbuster start to the year, with the group plowing less money into everything from U.S. stocks to bullish call options. Daily average trades for at least two online brokerages have edged down from their 2021 highs. Across the industry, traffic to brokerage websites, as well as the amount of time spent on them, has fallen.  The decline in enthusiasm marks a sharp reversal from just a few months ago, when individual investors’ frenetic activity took center stage in financial markets. As shares of “meme stocks” soared in January, millions of small investors piled in, kicking an already robust retail-investing trend into overdrive. In a mania unlike anything market observers had ever seen, individual investors sent stocks like GameStop Corp. soaring, pushing brokerage platforms to the top of app-store rankings. Trading volume surged so much that many brokerages struggled to keep their platforms smoothly running.  Driving the recent pullback, individual investors and analysts said, is a series of factors, including concerns about the volatility among growth stocks—a group in which small investors tend to be heavily invested. Since Feb. 12, when the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite hit its most recent record, individual-investor favorites including Tesla Inc., NIO Inc. and Apple Inc. have each fallen more than 9%.  “Like any investor, you’re not going to add fresh money to a market that doesn’t have a clear catalyst to drive stocks 5% to 10% higher,” said Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda Research. “Retail investors have gone into hibernation in the past couple of weeks.”"
48,49,https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-democrats-cool-to-bidens-plan-to-boost-corporate-tax-rate-11617537601,"WASHINGTON—President Biden’s proposed tax increases on corporations as part of a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan have drawn a skeptical reaction from some Democrats, who instead favor borrowing money to pay for the investments or raising other levies, like the gasoline tax, to do so.  The proposal would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and increase taxes on companies’ foreign earnings. The White House said the tax increases would, over 15 years, cover the cost of the $2.3 trillion package, which puts money toward improving roads, bridges, and transit systems, along with expanding broadband access and myriad other efforts.  Republicans have widely rejected Mr. Biden’s proposed tax increases, but some Democrats are raising their own questions about the plan. With very narrow majorities in the House and Senate, Democrats will need nearly unanimous support in their party to advance the package without Republican votes, and many lawmakers are floating potential changes to the plan.  Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.), the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said he didn’t think paying for the full cost of the plan through tax increases was necessary. Mr. DeFazio said he would support an increase in the gas and diesel tax to pay for the new investments over time, as well as more borrowing to cover part of the cost.  “When you’re borrowing money for current consumption versus borrowing money for investment it’s a different thing,” he said."

In a spate of Sunday television interviews, Republicans continued to criticize the size and sweep of the proposal unveiled Wednesday aimed at addressing climate change—as well as the corporate-tax hike proposed to pay for it.  They also questioned the White House commitment to bipartisanship, saying it was hard for them to support proposals so at odds with their longstanding priorities, even if paired with funding for roads and bridges.  “How could the president expect to have bipartisanship when his proposal is a repeal of one of [Republicans’] signature issues in 2017?” Mississippi GOP Sen. Roger Wicker said on NBC. Mr. Wicker added that every Republican senator voted for corporate tax cuts four years ago that Mr. Biden now wants them to partially reverse.  The criticism illustrated the plan’s legislative challenges ahead because of the 50-50 party divide in the Senate. Biden administration leaders cast their plan as a historic opportunity to make a generational investment in the country, but it will go nowhere unless they balance complaints from Democratic senators who say the plan doesn’t go far enough with Republican criticism that it is too broad. Some moderate Democrats also share GOP concerns about big spending and tax increases."

A federal judge halted that deportation pause days after it was issued in January, but ICE statistics show that enforcement priorities the administration introduced have sharply reduced most of the agency’s activity anyway.  ICE’s arrests fell by about two-thirds in March compared with the monthly tallies toward the end of the Trump administration, when arrests had already slowed amid the continuing pandemic, the data show. Deportations fell by nearly 50%. And ICE’s population of immigrants in detention—which peaked above 56,000 in 2019—fell to 14,000 in March.

The Texas Rangers are scheduled to make a bold move for their home opener Monday that has some medical experts and President Joe Biden concerned.  Globe Life Field in Arlington will be the first Major League Baseball stadium to reopen at full capacity -- roughly 40,000 seats -- since the pandemic began. The move comes a month after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ended the state's mask mandate and asked businesses to reopen fully, citing declining COVID-19 cases and vaccination numbers.  In a statement released on March 10, Neil Leibman, the team’s president of business operations, said the Rangers were encouraged by the governor's orders and were taking measures to ensure fans were safe, including requiring masks, except for while eating.  Following Monday's home opener, the stadium will have sections that allow fans to watch with ""distanced seating.""  “We will continue to monitor developments and implement the necessary public health measures,” Leibman said in a statement.  The Houston Astros, Texas' other MLB team, will only be operating at 50% of Minute Maid Park's roughly 41,000 seat capacity for April. The stadium will also require masks for fans when they're not eating.  Dr. Emily Landon, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, told ABC News last month that baseball and other outdoor sports provide better protection for crowds than indoor arenas, since it's harder for air particles to linger.  While she said the decision by MLB teams to reopen their games to fans was safe, she warned that the Rangers' full capacity reopening was riskier, due to the sheer number of people crowded together.  The country is still seeing thousands of cases a day, particularly from the virus variants, Landon noted.  ""You don’t know who is going to come in with COVID-19,"" she told ABC News.  Biden weighed in on the Rangers' plans during an interview with ESPN last week, calling the move ""not responsible.""  ""They should listen to Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, the scientists and the experts. But I think it's not responsible,"" the president said.  Biden warned about potential surges, citing the jumps in European nations that have reopened, and reiterated that vaccinations need to increase before businesses can reopen fully.  ""We have to get to the point where enough people have taken the vaccine, so we diminish the possibility for it to spread,"" he said.  The seven-day average of new daily cases in Texas has decreased from 7,693 to 3,667 between March 1 and April 1, according to the state's health department.

With the megaphone is Ethan Nordean, second from left. The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers make up a fraction of the more than 300 Trump supporters charged so far in the siege that led to Trump's second impeachment and resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer. But several of their leaders, members and associates have become the central targets of the Justice Department’s sprawling investigation. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  FBI agents recruited a Proud Boys leader to provide them with information about antifa networks months before he was charged with storming the U.S. Capitol with other members of the far-right extremist group, a defense attorney says.  Proud Boys “thought leader” and organizer Joseph Biggs agreed to provide the FBI with information about anti-fascist activists in Florida and elsewhere after an agent contacted him in late July 2020 and arranged to meet at a restaurant, Biggs’ lawyer, J. Daniel Hull, wrote Monday in a court filing.  The two agents who met with Biggs wanted to know what he was “seeing on the ground,” Hull said. Over the next few weeks, Biggs answered an agent’s follow-up questions in a series of phone calls.  ADVERTISEMENT  “They spoke often,” added Hull, who is petitioning a judge to keep Biggs out of jail pending trial.  The defense lawyer’s claims buttress a widely held view among left-leaning ideological opponents of the Proud Boys that law enforcement has coddled them, condoned their violence and even protected them during their frequent street brawls with anti-fascists. The Proud Boys even have counted some law enforcement officers among their ranks, including a Connecticut police officer and a Louisiana sheriff’s deputy .  Biggs also received “cautionary” phone calls from FBI agents and routinely spoke with local and federal law enforcement officials in Portland, Oregon, about rallies he was planning there in 2019 and 2020, according to Hull.  “These talks were intended both to inform law enforcement about Proud Boy activities in Portland on a courtesy basis but also to ask for advice on planned marches or demonstrations, i.e., what march routes to take on Portland streets, where to go, where not to go,” Hull wrote.  FBI Director Christopher Wray has said there was no evidence that antifa was to blame for the Jan. 6 violence. But that hasn’t stopped some on the right from making the claims.  Antifa was the Trump administration’s villainous scapegoat for much of last year’s social unrest following the death of George Floyd. Trump and then-Attorney General William Barr blamed antifa activists for some of the violence at protests over police killings of Black people across the U.S.  ADVERTISEMENT  The FBI and the Justice Department had launched a number of investigations into extremist groups around that time. They were focused on whether people were violating federal law by crossing state lines to commit violence or whether anyone was paying to send antifa followers to commit violence, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official could not discuss the investigations publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.  FBI agents responded to police stations in several cities, including New York, to question suspects arrested during protests and focused on those who self-identified as followers of the movement, the official said.  But investigators struggled to make any cases, in part because there is no hierarchical structure to antifa; it’s not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations, according to the official.  The FBI would not comment on why agents were meeting with Biggs or why the bureau was trying to solicit information about antifa through the Proud Boys.  Biggs, 37, of Ormond Beach, Florida, wouldn’t be the first Proud Boys informant. The group’s chairman and top leader, Enrique Tarrio, previously worked undercover and cooperated with investigators after he was accused of fraud in 2012, court documents show.  Eric Ward, executive director of the Portland-based Western States Center, which tracks hate groups, said it was “deeply concerning” to learn that Biggs had worked with the FBI, particularly because law enforcement has “frequently maintained inappropriately close relations with far-right groups.” The Proud Boys actively promoted violence and street brawling at the rallies in Portland, he said, and Biggs “called for violence in the streets.”  “Law enforcement has no credible reason for working with someone like Biggs. It’s long past time for a clear accounting of institutional and professional law enforcement relationships with groups espousing political violence at home and abroad,” Ward wrote in an email.  Biggs and three other Proud Boys leaders were indicted March 10 on charges that they planned and carried out a coordinated attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s electoral victory. At least 20 others in the group have been charged in federal court with offenses related to the riots out of about 350 people charged so far in the deadly riot.  Proud Boys members describe themselves as a politically incorrect men’s club for “Western chauvinists.” Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, who founded the Proud Boys in 2016, sued the Southern Poverty Law Center for labeling it as a hate group. In response, the law center said Proud Boys members often spread “outright bigotry” over the internet and have posted social media pictures of themselves with prominent Holocaust deniers, white nationalists and “known neo-Nazis.”  Justice Department prosecutors want to jail Biggs while he and the others await trial because he “presents a danger not only based on his own potential violence, but violence by others who undoubtedly still support him.”  But Biggs’ lawyer said the incarceration bid hinges on evidence that is speculative at best.  “Importantly, the FBI has known about his political commentary and role in planning events and counter-protests in Portland and other cities since at least July 2020 and arguably benefitted from that knowledge in efforts to gather intelligence about Antifa in Florida and Antifa networks operating across the United States,” Hull wrote.  The disclosures are reminiscent of an earlier collaboration between law enforcement and a right-wing group in Portland during repeated clashes between left- and right-wing demonstrators. The far-right group Patriot Prayer staged multiple rallies and marches in the liberal city, drawing out hundreds of residents to oppose its message in standoffs that sometimes ended in violence.  In 2019, Portland opened an internal investigation after more than 11,500 text messages between Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson and police Lt. Jeff Niiya became public. Niiya was cleared in the investigation, but the episode led to training and changes in the way liaison officers communicate with groups before and during planned protests."

Trump’s campaign needed money when he went online and chipped in everything he could: $500.  It was a big sum for a 63-year-old battling cancer and living in Kansas City on less than $1,000 per month. But that single contribution — federal records show it was his first ever — quickly multiplied. Another $500 was withdrawn the next day, then $500 the next week and every week through mid-October, without his knowledge — until Mr. Blatt’s bank account had been depleted and frozen. When his utility and rent payments bounced, he called his brother, Russell, for help.  What the Blatts soon discovered was $3,000 in withdrawals by the Trump campaign in less than 30 days. They called their bank and said they thought they were victims of fraud.  “It felt,” Russell said, “like it was a scam.”  But what the Blatts believed was duplicity was actually an intentional scheme to boost revenues by the Trump campaign and the for-profit company that processed its online donations, WinRed. Facing a cash crunch and getting badly outspent by the Democrats, the campaign had begun last September to set up recurring donations by default for online donors, for every week until the election."
56,57,https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-yorks-tax-madness-11617563263?mod=opinion_lead_pos1,"As New York’s Covid expatriates consider returning to the office, lawmakers in Albany should be shouting welcome home. Instead they’re eyeing big new tax increases that would give the state’s temporary refugees to Florida—or wherever—one more reason to stay away for good. On Sunday a budget deal appeared close, but not cinched by our deadline. Here are some of the proposals the state Assembly set out:  • Income taxes: Impose graduated rates on millionaires, up to 11.85%. This is much higher than today’s top marginal levy of 8.82% on joint filers earning $2.2 million. Under the Assembly’s plan, that existing bracket would be taxed at 9.85%. Earnings above $5 million would be hit with 10.85%. The new top marginal rate, 11.85%, would kick in at $25 million.  Since New York City has its own income tax, running to 3.88%, the combined rate would be 15.73%. That’s a bigger bite than even California’s notorious 13.3% top tax, and don’t forget Uncle Sam’s 37% share. Pretty soon living in a low-tax state looks inviting. Keep in mind that New York’s income tax is already progressive: The top 5% of filers contribute more than 60% of the revenue, the Journal reports.  • Capital-gains taxes: Put a 1% surtax on investment gains by people earning $1 million a year. That percentage might sound small, but New York already taxes capital gains as regular income. So start with the Assembly’s new top marginal rate of 15.73% for a Manhattanite. Add the 1% surtax. The top federal rate on cap gains is 23.8%. The grand total would be 40.53%, and that’s before Joe Biden’s campaign promise to tax capital gains federally as regular income. What a thanks for investing to create jobs in the city.  • Estate taxes: Raise the top rate to 20%, from today’s 16%, for taxable estates above $10.1 million. Remember, again, this is stacked atop the federal estate tax of 40%, meaning the government’s marginal take would reach 60%. Is it any wonder that wealthy people spend big bucks hiring estate lawyers?"

One of the biggest and least-known companies in the industry did the opposite.  Sherman Financial Group filed more lawsuits to squeeze cash from people behind on their credit-card bills. A Wall Street Journal analysis, based on the five state-court districts with searchable online records, showed Sherman had the largest year-over-year increase of any firm identified between last March 15 and Dec. 31—up 52% from the year-earlier period, compared with a 24% decline in those districts for the industry as a whole.  Sherman, a privately held enterprise, through its subsidiaries filed 15,420 more debt-collection lawsuits in those districts than during the year-earlier period. Those courts serve 13% of the U.S. population.  In doing so, Sherman has cemented its reputation as a maverick in the industry. Since founding the company two decades ago, Sherman Chief Executive Ben Navarro has helped transform the once small and fragmented business of collecting old credit-card debt into a multibillion-dollar industry dominated by huge firms."

To wit, they are pitting themselves against the interests of their own shareholders.  Companies have long sought to influence policies that affect their business, and rightly so. They have the First Amendment right to petition the government. And as the reach of the state has grown, the success or failure of a firm or industry can depend on defeating political predators in Washington or state capitals. We wish it were otherwise, but this is today’s reality.  The CEO intervention into Georgia election law is different. It concerns a matter that doesn’t directly affect Coca-Cola or Delta Airlines , to cite two companies whose executives condemned the new law. The CEOs are instead injecting themselves into a heated debate over election law and the tension between ballot access and integrity.  This is about the rules of politics, and it means taking sides in a debate between the electoral interests of the two parties. Republicans in Georgia tightened what they regarded as loose rules that accommodated the special circumstances of the pandemic. Democrats claim the rules are too restrictive and want to stigmatize them as “Jim Crow 2.0” to help them pass a national election law (H.R.1) that would impose voting rules they prefer.  This is the kind of brawl that most CEOs typically avoid as too polarizing, and even business lobbies like the Chamber of Commerce tend to steer clear. Not this time."
59,60,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-better-corporate-tax-for-america-11617813355?mod=opinion_lead_pos5,"When Congress enacted the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, the result was a dramatic reduction in corporate tax revenue. Over the past three years, corporate tax collections have fallen to their lowest level since World War II: 1% of gross domestic product. Many of the country’s largest companies paid no federal income taxes in 2020.  Proponents of the TCJA said the U.S. would get something in return for these tax cuts. Lower rates, the argument went, would lure production and investment to our shores, but that hasn’t happened—and for an obvious reason: Other countries see what we’re doing and respond. When they see us lower our rates, they lower theirs to undercut us. In the end, no nation ends up more competitive. The result is a global race to the bottom: Who can lower their corporate rate further and faster?  The TCJA not only perpetuated this race to the bottom; it also put America at a disadvantage. The law creates an incentive for U.S. companies to offshore their workers and investments—and to shift their profits to tax havens. One reason is the minimum tax on the foreign profits of American multinational corporations. In theory, a minimum tax should stop the flow of business out of a country because firms know they’ll be taxed no matter where they go; they can’t game the system. But the TCJA’s minimum tax was poorly designed.  If you’re a U.S. firm that does business abroad, the TCJA essentially gives you an easy—but perverse—choice: You can move your foreign profits and operations to America, where the corporate tax rate is 21%, or you can keep them anywhere else in the world, where the U.S. will charge you around half that. It’s not a hard call, especially because the minimum tax is calculated based on a firm’s total global profits rather than looking at what the company earns in each different country. With no one looking at individual jurisdictions, corporations can shift and book profits wherever they can get the lowest tax bill. The TCJA also makes the first 10% of returns earned by foreign assets tax exempt, a powerful incentive for companies to offshore factories and jobs. It isn’t an overstatement to say that today most firms would prefer to earn income anywhere but America.  The U.S. isn’t the only loser in this race to the bottom. So are our corporations. The global competition for low rates allows American firms to pay less taxes—or none at all—but they still pay a significant cost. Over the next 10 years, more than $2 trillion of the U.S. corporate tax base will flow out of the country because of the broken system I’ve described. Our tax revenues are already at their lowest level in generations, and as they continue to drop, the country will have less money to invest in airports, roads, bridges, broadband, job training, and research and development."

Now the Chinese government is minting cash digitally, in a re-imagination of money that could shake a pillar of American power.  It might seem money is already virtual, as credit cards and payment apps such as Apple Pay in the U.S. and WeChat in China eliminate the need for bills or coins. But those are just ways to move money electronically. China is turning legal tender itself into computer code.  Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have foreshadowed a potential digital future for money, though they exist outside the traditional global financial system and aren’t legal tender like cash issued by governments.  China’s version of a digital currency is controlled by its central bank, which will issue the new electronic money. It is expected to give China’s government vast new tools to monitor both its economy and its people. By design, the digital yuan will negate one of bitcoin’s major draws: anonymity for the user.  Beijing is also positioning the digital yuan for international use and designing it to be untethered to the global financial system, where the U.S. dollar has been king since World War II. China is embracing digitization in many forms, including money, in a bid to gain more centralized control while getting a head start on technologies of the future that it regards as up for grabs."
61,62,https://reason.com/2021/04/07/bidens-infrastructure-plan-isnt-about-infrastructure-its-about-paying-off-political-allies/#comments,"As it turns out, a huge chunk of President Joe Biden's infrastructure plan doesn't have much to do with infrastructure.  This is not much of a surprise, given that Biden's pandemic recovery bill had almost nothing to do with the pandemic. But in some ways, it also misses the larger point. Even many of the parts of the bill that are nominally about actual physical infrastructure aren't really about infrastructure. They're about shoveling money in the direction of Democratic political allies—mostly unions. And that explains a lot of the rest of the bill, too.  Republicans have been circulating a talking point about how only 7 percent of the $2.25 trillion proposal is actually related to infrastructure. This is somewhat ungenerous, as it only counts a narrow category of spending on roads, bridges, waterways, ports, and airports.  But even a quite generous accounting still suggests that only a little more than half of the bill is targeted at anything that meets the definition of infrastructure, and that includes projects like $111 billion for drinking water and $328 billion for upgrading military health facilities and other federal buildings. As Politico notes, those sorts of projects involve some amount of physical building and construction but have never been previously categorized as infrastructure.  The plan also includes a lot of spending on stuff that doesn't even remotely count as infrastructure. For example, the proposal includes about $590 billion for vaguely defined job training, research and development, and industrial policy, as well as another $400 billion for expanding and supporting home health care. That's about $1 trillion in non-infrastructure spending in a supposed infrastructure bill.  Until quite recently, $1 trillion was considered a lot of money, even for the federal government, and both of those funding pools would likely have been separate bills debated on their merits. Instead, Biden and congressional Democrats are attempting to redefine them as infrastructure and pass them on the argument that what America needs right now is more infrastructure spending…including, it seems, on programs that have nothing to do with infrastructure.  This, however, isn't stopping Democrats from demanding, sometimes quite explicitly, that we treat non-infrastructure programs as infrastructure. Here, for example, is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's (D–N.Y.) tweet from this morning:  Paid leave is infrastructure.  Child care is infrastructure.  Caregiving is infrastructure. — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 7, 2021  Sure, and in my heart, home cocktail bars are also infrastructure. Everything's infrastructure, if you want it to be. You just have to believe.  One reason the partisan debate is going this way is that, in American political rhetoric, infrastructure is generally coded as good. Democrats obviously like infrastructure, but so do Republicans, and politicians on both sides of the aisle generally want to be seen as being for more infrastructure, because infrastructure is popular. So the attempt by Democrats to recategorize non-infrastructure projects as infrastructure is in some sense an attempt to argue that these programs are good without having to make an extended case for them on the merits.  In some ways, the question of how to describe and categorize the bill's different spending programs (while not unimportant) obscures the actual question, which is whether the bill is worthwhile on the merits. And the answer there is: not really.  Because even if you just confine your analysis to the parts of the bill that are actually infrastructure, what you find is that it's chock-full of provisions that almost seem intentionally designed to make big infrastructure projects much slower to complete and much more expensive.  As Reason's Christian Britschgi wrote, the plan includes ""Buy American"" and prevailing wage provisions that would drive up the already-high costs of infrastructure and funnel a lot of money to the unions that support Biden, and that Biden has repeatedly said he supports. To the extent that American infrastructure has problems, it's partly because of comparatively high construction costs that make projects more difficult to build. Instead of attempting to solve that problem, Biden's infrastructure plan would make it worse.  That's because, at its heart, it's not really an infrastructure plan. It's a payoff plan for Biden's labor allies. And that helps explain the non-infrastructure parts of the plan too. The $400 billion for home health care would heavily benefit the Service Employees International Union.  Nor is it an accident that Biden's plan would, as Reason's Eric Boehm recently noted, overturn right-to-work laws, which prevent unions from charging dues to non-members. This, of course, has nothing to do with building better infrastructure. It is, however, a major, longstanding political goal for unions. Maybe union dues from non-union members are infrastructure?  It's all infrastructure if you want it to be. And, by the same token, none of it is infrastructure. To paraphrase a great movie, when everything's infrastructure, nothing is."

Playing along felt like the price of inclusion. I spoke up only when it looked like he would become an official manager — my manager — replacing the one I adored and wielding even more power over me. At least four other women said that he’d made them uncomfortable, in addition to two senior engineers who already made it clear that they wouldn’t work with him.  As soon as my complaint with H.R. was filed, Google went from being a great workplace to being any other company: It would protect itself first. I’d structured my life around my job — exactly what they wanted me to do — but that only made the fallout worse when I learned that the workplace that I cherished considered me just an employee, one of many and disposable.  The process stretched out for nearly three months. In the meantime I had to have one-on-one meetings with my harasser and sit next to him. Every time I asked for an update on the timeline and expressed my discomfort at having to continue to work in proximity to my harasser, the investigators said that I could seek counseling, work from home or go on leave. I later learned that Google had similar responses to other employees who reported racism or sexism. Claire Stapleton, one of the 2018 walkout organizers, was encouraged to take leave, and Timnit Gebru, a lead researcher on Google’s Ethical AI team, was encouraged to seek mental health care before being forced out.  I resisted. How would being alone by myself all day, apart from my colleagues, friends and support system, possibly help? And I feared that if I stepped away, the company wouldn’t continue the investigation.  Eventually, the investigators corroborated my claims and found my tech lead violated the Code of Conduct and the policy against harassment. My harasser still sat next to me. My manager told me H.R. wouldn’t even make him change his desk, let alone work from home or go on leave. He also told me that my harasser received a consequence that was severe and that I would feel better if I could know what it was, but it sure seemed like nothing happened.  The aftermath of speaking up had broken me down. It dredged up the betrayals of my past that I’d gone into tech trying to overcome. I’d made myself vulnerable to my manager and the investigators but felt I got nothing solid in return. I was constantly on edge from seeing my harasser in the hallways and at the cafes. When people came up behind my desk, I startled more and more easily, my scream echoing across the open-floor-plan office. I worried I’d get a poor performance review, ruining my upward trajectory and setting my career back even further.  I went weeks without sleeping through the night.  I decided to take three months of paid leave. I feared that going on leave would set me back for promotion in a place where almost everyone’s progress is public and seen as a measure of an engineer’s worth and expertise. Like most of my colleagues, I’d built my life around the company. It could so easily be taken away. People on leave weren’t supposed to enter the office — where I went to the gym and had my entire social life."

Democrats have been moving left for a while, but if you look at the General Social Survey Data, the big changes have come over the past decade. Republican and Democratic presidents from Jimmy Carter through Barack Obama worked within the parameters of the American system, but a new generation in the country, raised amid the financial crisis, wants to smash the “neoliberal consensus.” This intellectual shift in the Democratic Party — starting with the young, but now encompassing most of the establishment — is what is driving Biden to do so much so fast, and it will continue to drive him throughout his presidency.  He may not have sought transformation, but transformation found him.  Ten years ago, I would have been aghast at this leftward shift. But like everybody else, I’ve seen inequality widen, the social fabric decay, the racial wealth gap increase. Americans are rightly convinced that the country is broken and fear it is in decline. Like a lot of people, I’ve moved left on what I think of the role of government and income redistribution issues. We surely need to invest a lot more in infrastructure and children.  But I worry about this new economic philosophy that asserts you can have everything you want without trade-offs.

I worry we’re unwittingly committing ourselves to decades of higher taxes down the line that will sap American dynamism.  This is columnist heresy, but I’m going to take my time making up my mind on Biden’s $3 trillion spending package.

A leading theory has emerged in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter: The suspected Chinese hackers mined troves of personal information acquired beforehand to carry out the attack.  Such a method, if confirmed, could realize long-held fears about the national security consequences of Beijing’s prior massive data thefts. And it would suggest the hackers had a higher degree of planning and sophistication than previously understood.  “We face sophisticated adversaries who, we know, have collected large amounts of passwords and personal information in their successful hacks,” said Anne Neuberger, President Biden’s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology. “Their potential ability to operationalize that information at scale is a significant concern.”  Soon after the hack on computer systems using Microsoft Exchange Server was discovered in March, senior national security officials in the Biden administration recognized it as a major international cybersecurity problem."

Ms. Haaland noted that the area was “filled with cultural heritage.” But local opposition to restoring the boundaries was underscored by pickup trucks and minivans parked near the site of her meetings, with signs saying, “NO MONUMENT.”  The Biden administration is reviewing the downsizing of Bears Ears and nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had put more than 3 million acres here—most of this corner of the state—under federal protection."

An A and B student before the pandemic, she was failing three classes. The academic slide left her mother, Carola Mengolini, in tears. She insisted her daughter create to-do lists and moved the girl’s workspace into the guest bedroom to pull up her grades.  Over the summer, Victoria’s tennis and theater camps were canceled. Her family postponed a planned trip to Argentina to visit her extended family.  She formed a pandemic pod with five close friends, but the girls bickered. Subcliques formed, and Victoria and her best friend found themselves excluded. The pod fell apart.  The return of in-person schooling last fall brought some relief, but with some of her classmates still at home, teachers had to shift their attention between in-person kids and those online, leaving students feeling disorganized and behind."
72,73,https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-seeks-more-money-for-education-health-in-spending-request-11617980523?mod=politics_lead_pos6,"WASHINGTON—President Biden is seeking more funding for education, healthcare, research and renewable energy next year in a $1.52 trillion spending plan reflecting his vision of an expansive federal government that tackles issues ranging from climate change to racial inequality.  The preliminary plan released Friday by the White House would raise discretionary spending by 8.4%, or $118 billion, from the $1.4 trillion authorized last year, excluding emergency measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Discretionary spending is the part of the budget that Congress shapes through the appropriations process.  Nondefense spending would rise 16% next fiscal year to $769.4 billion. Spending on defense would increase 1.7% to $753 billion—much less than Republicans are likely to support but more than called for by progressives, who pushed for cuts during the Trump administration.  The proposal fulfills some of Mr. Biden’s campaign promises, including more money for schools in high-poverty areas, cancer research and investments to address climate change. It drew immediate opposition from some Republican lawmakers, who called it an intrusive expansion of federal power.  The request would lift nondefense spending as a share of gross domestic product to 3.3%, roughly in line with its average over the past 30 years, officials said. It will be followed later this spring by a full budget proposal that includes mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, tax increases and the impact over the next decade on deficits, debt and the economy."

Mr. Manchin, then a state senator and small-business owner, was running for West Virginia governor in 1996, his first bid for statewide office. He had built a business-friendly, culturally conservative profile during 15 years in the legislature, supporting job-creation incentives for business and opposing abortion rights. Banking and insurance groups endorsed him, along with the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association.  But an important set of players—the state’s labor unions—viewed him as an enemy, in large part because he had voted to scale back injury awards in the workers’ compensation system. At union gatherings, coal miners wore T-shirts with Mr. Manchin’s name crossed out. Bumper stickers featuring a bloody hatchet reminded workers of his vote. “Don’t forget workers’ comp” was a union battle cry.  Mr. Manchin lost the Democratic primary to a union-backed candidate. But the defeat set off a course correction that helps to explain his political buoyancy today as the rare Democrat representing a solidly Republican state, as well as his insistence on bipartisan cooperation in the Senate, often to the frustration of his own party.  Once viewed by unions as hostile, Mr. Manchin, after 1996, found issues on which he could advocate for union interests and began a campaign to convince organized labor that he would adopt an inclusive governing style that would give it a seat at the table in policy debates."
